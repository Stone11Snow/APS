The uncertainty associated with renewable power makes it impossible to tackle this problem via a brute-force approach, i.e. it is not possible to run detailed online static or dynamic simulations for all possible security problems and realizations of load and renewable power. Intelligent approaches for online security assessment with forecast uncertainty modeling are being sought to better handle contingency events. This paper reports the platform developed within the iTesla project for online static and dynamic security assessment. This innovative and open-source computational platform is composed of several modules such as detailed static and dynamic simulation, machine learning, forecast uncertainty representation and optimization tools to not only filter contingencies but also to provide the best control actions to avoid possible unsecure situations. Based on High Performance Computing (HPC), the iTesla platform was tested in the French network for a specific security problem: overload of transmission circuits. The results obtained show that forecast uncertainty representation is of the utmost importance, since from apparently secure forecast network states, it is possible to obtain unsecure situations that need to be tackled in advance by the system operator.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1970-0; POD:978-1-5090-1971-7; USB:978-1-5090-1969-4","10.1109/PMAPS.2016.7764166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7764166","High Performance Computing;Machine Learning;Online Static/Dynamic Security Assessment;Renewable Power;Uncertainty Modeling","Computational modeling;Decision support systems;Handheld computers;High performance computing;Monte Carlo methods;Security;Uncertainty","power system security;power system simulation;renewable energy sources","French network;brute-force approach;dynamic security assessment;dynamic simulations;forecast uncertainty representation;high performance computing;iTesla project approach;load power;load uncertainty;machine learning;modern power systems;online security assessment;online static security assessment;online static simulation;open-source computational platform;optimization tools;renewable generation uncertainty;renewable power;secure integration","","","","","","","16-20 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In sports, TBW estimations are of importance because mild water losses can impair muscular strength and aerobic endurance. Severe water losses can even be life threatening. TBW estimations based on bioimpedance, however, fail during sports because the increased body temperature corrupts bioimpedance measurements. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning method that eliminates the effects of increased temperature on bioimpedance and, consequently, reveals the changes in bioimpedance that are due to TBW loss. This is facilitated by utilizing changes in skin and core temperature. The method was evaluated in a study in which bioimpedance, temperature, and TBW loss were recorded every 15 min during a 2-h running workout. The evaluation demonstrated that the proposed method is able to reduce the error of TBW loss estimation by up to 71%, compared to the state of art. In the future, the proposed method in combination with portable bioimpedance devices might facilitate the development of wearable systems for continuous and noninvasive TBW loss monitoring during sports.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2466076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7182268","Bioimpedance;dehydration;machine learning;physical exercise;sports;temperature;water loss","Bioimpedance;Biomedical measurement;Current measurement;Informatics;Loss measurement;Skin;Temperature measurement","bioelectric phenomena;biomedical measurement;biothermics;electric impedance measurement;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;skin;sport","aerobic endurance;bioimpedance measurements;body temperature;continuous total body water loss monitoring;core temperature;human body;machine learning method;muscular strength;noninvasive total body water loss monitoring;portable bioimpedance devices;running workout;skin temperature;sports;temperature-based bioimpedance correction;time 2 h;total body water loss estimation error;water loss estimation;wearable systems","","0","","","","20150807","Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Point Cloud-based Automatic Assessment of 3D Computer Animation Courseworks","G. Paravati; F. Lamberti; V. Gatteschi; C. Demartini; P. Montuschi","","IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Computer-supported assessment tools can bring significant benefits to both students and teachers. When integrated in traditional education workflows, they may help to reduce the time required to perform the evaluation and consolidate the perception of fairness of the overall process. When integrated within on-line intelligent tutoring systems, they could provide students with a timely feedback and support self-assessment activities. The current work presents an alternative approach (and not just a “yet-anotherimplementation”) to the problem of automatically evaluating technical skills needed to create 3D computer animations. Although some solutions have been reported already in the literature, their applicability is partially constrained, as they require the teaching staff to define evaluation criteria that are strictly linked to the particular animation technique being assessed. Students are forced to operate in environments where they can only perform a part of the required animation steps, by using a pre-defined set of techniques and tools. To address such limitations, the proposed system exploits shape- and time-based features extracted from the 3D point clouds (i.e., the set of data points) describing animated geometries, which are independent of the particular animation techniques used. Experimental observations collected in the evaluation of course assignments in which students were asked to recreate 3D animations of deformable meshes prepared by the teaching staff showed a good correlation between automatic and manual evaluations. Obtained results confirmed the ability of the proposed approach to cope with heterogeneous evaluation tasks in which the relevant learning outcomes can be properly considered.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2016.2638811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782348","Automatic assessment;computer animation;computer graphics;feature extraction;machine learning;point cloud","Animation;Computer graphics;Computer science;Education;Geometry;Software;Three-dimensional displays","","","","","","","","20161213","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The sustainability and productivity of rice growing areas is dependent on suitable climatic conditions. Variability in seasonal climate conditions can have detrimental effect, with incidents of drought reducing production. Developing better techniques to predict crop productivity in different climatic conditions can assist farmer and other stakeholders in better decision making in terms of agronomy and crop choice. Machine learning techniques can be used to improve prediction of crop yield under different climatic scenarios. This paper presents the review on use of such machine learning technique for Indian rice cropping areas. This paper discusses the experimental results obtained by applying SMO classifier using the WEKA tool on the dataset of 27 districts of Maharashtra state, India. The dataset considered for the rice crop yield prediction was sourced from publicly available Indian Government records. The parameters considered for the study were precipitation, minimum temperature, average temperature, maximum temperature and reference crop evapotranspiration, area, production and yield for the Kharif season (June to November) for the years 1998 to 2002. For the present study the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE) and root relative squared error (RRSE) were calculated. The experimental results showed that the performance of other techniques on the same dataset was much better compared to SMO.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2033-1; POD:978-1-5090-2034-8","10.1109/JCSSE.2016.7748856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748856","artificial intelligence;crop analysis;crop yield;machine learning technique;prediction","Agriculture;Computer science;Government;Meteorology;Production;Software engineering;Support vector machines","atmospheric temperature;climatology;crops;evaporation;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;productivity;rain;support vector machines;transpiration","Indian rice cropping areas;Kharif season;MAE;Maharashtra state;RAE;RMSE;RRSE;SMO classifier;WEKA tool;agronomy;average temperature;cereal crops;climatic conditions;crop choice;crop productivity;decision making;drought;food production;machine learning;maximum temperature;mean absolute error;minimum temperature;precipitation;publicly available Indian Government records;pulses;reference crop evapotranspiration;relative absolute error;rice crop yield prediction;root mean squared error;root relative squared error;seasonal climate conditions;support vector machines;wheat","","1","","","","","13-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It refers to a classification problem where the main focus is to predict the polarity of words and then classify them into positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers people a fast and effective way to measure the public's feelings towards their party and politicians. The primary issue in previous sentiment analysis techniques is the determination of the most appropriate classifier for a given classification problem. If one classifier is chosen from the available classifiers, then there is no surety in the best performance on unseen data. So to reduce the risk of selecting an inappropriate classifier, we are combining the outputs of a set of classifiers. Thus in this paper, we use an approach that automatically classifies the sentiment of tweets by combining machine learning classifiers with lexicon based classifier. The new combination of classifiers are SentiWordNet classifier, naive bayes classifier and hidden markov model classifier. Here positivity or negativity of each tweet is determined by using the majority voting principle on the result of these three classifiers. Thus we were used this sentiment classifier for finding political sentiment from real time tweets. Thus we have got an improved accuracy in sentiment analysis using classifier ensemble Approach. Our method also uses negation handling and word sense disambiguation to achieve high accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8594-7; POD:978-1-4673-8595-4","10.1109/SAPIENCE.2016.7684133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7684133","Machine Learning Methods;SentiWordNet;Sentiment Analysis;Word Sense Disambiguation;WordNet;ensemble Approach","Data mining;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Real-time systems;Sentiment analysis;Twitter;Voting","Bayes methods;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;politics;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","SentiWordNet classifier;Twitter data;classifier ensemble approach;election prediction;enhanced sentiment analysis;hidden markov model classifier;lexicon-based classifier;machine learning classifiers;majority voting principle;naive bayes classifier;political sentiment;sentiment classifier;word sense disambiguation","","","","","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Agent-Based Modeling of Retail Electrical Energy Markets With Demand Response","K. Dehghanpour; H. Nehrir; J. Sheppard; N. Kelly","","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","","2016","PP","99","1","1","In this paper, we study the behavior of a Day-Ahead (DA) retail electrical energy market with price-based Demand Response (DR) from Air Conditioning (AC) loads through a hierarchical multiagent framework, employing a machine learning approach. At the top level of the hierarchy, a retailer agent buys energy from the DA wholesale market and sells it to the consumers. The goal of the retailer agent is to maximize its profit by setting the optimal retail prices, considering the response of the price-sensitive loads. Upon receiving the retail prices, at the lower level of the hierarchy, the AC agents employ a Q-learning algorithm to optimize their consumption patterns through modifying the temperature set-points of the devices, considering both consumption costs and users’ comfort preferences. Since the retailer agent does not have direct access to the AC loads’ underlying dynamics and decision process (i.e., incomplete information) the data privacy of the consumers becomes a source of uncertainty in the retailer’s decision model. The retailer relies on techniques from the field of machine learning to develop a reliable model of the aggregate behavior of the price-sensitive loads to reduce the uncertainty of the decision-making process. Hence, a multiagent framework based on machine learning enables us to address issues such as interoperability and decision-making under incomplete information in a system that maintains the data privacy of the consumers. We will show that using the proposed model, all the agents are able to optimize their behavior simultaneously. Simulation results show that the proposed approach leads to a reduction in overall power consumption cost as the system converges to its equilibrium. This also coincides with maximization in the retailer’s profit. We will also show that the same decision architecture can be used to reduce peak load to defer/avoid distribution system upgr- des under high penetration of Photo-Voltaic (PV) power in the distribution feeder.","1949-3053;19493053","","10.1109/TSG.2016.2631453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755735","agent-based modeling;demand response;machine learning;retail electrical energy markets","Data privacy;Decision making;Load management;Load modeling;Optimization;Pricing;Uncertainty","","","","","","","","20161123","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We may want to do classification in certain domain in which we do not have enough labeled data but we have enough data in a different but related dataset. The field of transfer learning deal with such cases. The main problem solved by transfer learning is how to use information collected in a different domain in order to improve the inference performance in another domain. A special case is when we want to solve the same task in two datasets that have different marginal distributions. In those cases it is possible to use a method known as covariate shift in which we weight the training distribution using the density ratios in order to make inference on the target distribution. We show how a recently developed method can be used to estimate the weights needed in the covariate shift method and how this can be used in the transfer learning setting obtaining encouraging results.","","Online:978-1-78561-283-1","10.1049/ic.2016.0029","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7777667","Covariate Shift;Density Ratios;Machine Learning;Transfer Learning","","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","approximated density ratio;covariate shift method;data classification;data distribution;machine learning;marginal distribution;transfer learning","","","","","","","20-22 April 2016","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Expert surgeons are commonly asked to evaluate these performances using standardized five-point rating scales, but doing such ratings is time consuming, tedious, and somewhat subjective. This article presents an automatic skill evaluation system that analyzes only the contact force with the task materials, the broad-bandwidth accelerations of the robotic instruments and camera, and the task completion time. Methods: We recruited N=38 participants of varying skill in robotic surgery to perform three trials of peg transfer with a da Vinci Standard robot instrumented with our Smart Task Board. After calibration, three individuals rated these trials on five domains of the GEARS structured assessment tool, providing ground-truth labels for regression and classification machine learning algorithms that predict GEARS scores based on the recorded force, acceleration, and time signals. Results: Both machine learning approaches produced scores on the reserved testing sets that were in good to excellent agreement with the human raters, even when the force information was not considered. Furthermore, regression predicted GEARS scores more accurately and efficiently than classification. Conclusion: A surgeon’s skill at robotic peg transfer can be reliably rated via regression using features gathered from force, acceleration, and time sensors external to the robot. Significance: We expect improved trainee learning as a result of providing these automatic skill ratings during inanimate task practice on a surgical robot.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2634861","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765041","Machine Learning;Physical Interaction;Robotic Surgery;Skill Evaluation","Cameras;Instruments;Robot vision systems;Surgery;Training","","","","","","","","20161202","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The result of a questionnaire which compared a handmade recommendation with the proposed fully-automated recommendation showed that 80% of the residents selected the automated recommendation because of its appropriateness.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4075-9; POD:978-1-5090-4076-6","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778741","Energy consumption;Machine learning;Smart grids","Conferences;Electric variables measurement;Energy consumption;Home appliances;Power demand;Smart grids;Water heating","building management systems;energy conservation;energy management systems;smart power grids","HEMS service;automated generation method;clustering methods;energy utilization;energy-saving handbook;home appliances utilization;home energy management system;power consumption;smart grids","","1","","","","","6-9 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Investigating how weather influences the energy consumption is of great significance for energy demand forecasting. This paper proposes an optimum regression approach for analyzing weather influence on the energy consumption. It combines several regression algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with optimum weights. The weights of these regression algorithms are determined by formulation of an optimization model considering their corresponding fitting errors. Case studies on two international competitions on energy consumption forecasting are conducted. One is the 2015 Npower Forecasting Challenge, which focuses mainly on the gas consumption; the other one is the 2016 BigDEAL Forecasting Competition, which puts more attention on electrical load forecasting of a certain area. The proposed algorithm was ranked Top 2 in both competitions.

The reason behind these phenomena is either protein mutation or the changes in gene expression level that induces resistance to drug treatments. These mutations affect the drug binding activity, hence resulting in failure of treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct resistance testing in order to carry out HIV effective therapy. This study combines both sequence and structural features for predicting HIV resistance by applying SVM and Random Forests classifiers. The model was tested on the mutants of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase. Taken together the features we have used in our method, total contact energies among multiple mutations have a strong impact in predicting resistance as they are crucial in understanding the interactions of HIV mutants. The combination of sequence-structure features offers high accuracy with support vector machines as compared to Random Forests classifier. Both single and acquisition of multiple mutations are important in predicting HIV resistance to certain drug treatments. We have discovered the practicality of these features; hence these can be used in the future to predict resistance for other complex diseases.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2016.2638821","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782418","Data Mining;Drug Resistance;HIV;Machine Learning","Amino acids;Drugs;Electrical resistance measurement;Human immunodeficiency virus;Immune system;Proteins;Support vector machines","","","","","","","","20161213","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For saliency detection, we argue in this paper that the state-of-the-art High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard can be used to generate the useful features in compressed domain. Therefore, this paper proposes to learn the video saliency model, with regard to HEVC features. First, we establish an eye tracking database for video saliency detection, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/remega/video_database. Through the statistical analysis on our eye tracking database, we find out that human fixations tend to fall into the regions with large-valued HEVC features on splitting depth, bit allocation, and motion vector (MV). In addition, three observations are obtained with the further analysis on our eye tracking database. Accordingly, several features in HEVC domain are proposed on the basis of splitting depth, bit allocation, and MV. Next, a kind of support vector machine is learned to integrate those HEVC features together, for video saliency detection. Since almost all video data are stored in the compressed form, our method is able to avoid both the computational cost on decoding and the storage cost on raw data. More importantly, experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art saliency detection methods, either in compressed or uncompressed domain.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2628583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7742914","HEVC;SVM;Saliency detection;compressed domain;machine learning","Bit rate;Databases;Feature extraction;Gaze tracking;Image coding;Video coding;Visualization","computer vision;decoding;gaze tracking;image motion analysis;statistical analysis;support vector machines;video coding","HEVC features;HEVC standard;bit allocation;computational cost;computer vision;eye tracking database;high efficiency video coding;human fixations;image processing;motion vector;splitting depth;statistical analysis;storage cost;support vector machine;uncompressed domain;video data;video saliency detection;video saliency model","","","","","","20161114","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Fault diagnosis of circuits using statistical parameters and implementation using classifiers — A survey","P. Nagaraja; G.

Diagnozing the faults in circuit boards is very essential for achieving better reliability and easy maintainance of electronic systems. The circuit fault finding diagnosis is treated as the pattern recognition case and uses machine learning methodology. Increasing integration densities in advanced chips and high frequency of operation lead to subtle manifestation of faults in circuits of board level. Fault diagnosis by functional test is therefore necessary in place of structural test for board-level testing. Recent machine learning techniques use new algorithms to improve the success rate of functional fault diagnosis, reduces cost of product through successful servicing of circuits. Earlier methods of diagnosing fault using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Fuzzy logic were resulting in ambiguous or incorrect diagnostic results which take long time to debug and sometimes wrong repair actions, which significantly increase cost of servicing. Some key capabilities of these methods like capabilities of detecting, locating and identification of faults, the capabilities of detecting single or multiple faults, soft or hard faults, the capabilities of diagnosing linear or nonlinear circuits, etc are taken into account. Different classifications of fault diagnosis are reviewed. Various techniques for circuit fault diagnosis are also addressed in this paper. Survey on techniques of fault diagnosis provides a better insight for further research and application areas.","","CD:978-1-5090-0395-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-0396-9; POD:978-1-4673-8549-7","10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7754564","Circuit Fault diagnosis;SVM;functional failure;kernel;machine learning;self learning","Analog circuits;Artificial neural networks;Circuit faults;Electronic circuits;Fault diagnosis;Support vector machines","circuit reliability;circuit testing;electronic engineering computing;fault diagnosis;fuzzy logic;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis","ANN;artificial neural networks;board-level testing;classifiers;electronic circuits;fault diagnosis;fuzzy logic;machine learning;pattern recognition;reliability;statistical parameters","","","","","","","6-8 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an initial exploration of the effect of visual saliency models in the extraction of pathology-related relevant patterns, suitable for classification of Magnetic Resonance images of normal controls and probable Alzheimer's disease patients.

Most data clustering algorithms require the user to set a number of pre-defined parameters that have decisive impact in the formation of clusters, such as the number of clusters (initial or final), cluster radius, minimum number of objects, and similar parameters. In addition, several clustering algorithms are limited with regard to the shape of clusters that can be found, a limitation usually resulting from the optimisation process performed over a given distance metric. In this work, we propose a novel clustering algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned problems regarding the amount of parameters and cluster shape. Our approach makes use of the theory of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms in order to probabilistic sample a set of must-link/cannot link constraints in order to generate a data partition with the proper number of clusters.

Moreover, the demand for data centers is expected to grow owing to the increasing requirement for data processing related to Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Consequently, reducing the power consumption of data centers has become an urgent and major issue. Modification of the operational settings of equipment residing in a data center leads to fluctuations in the power consumption of other equipment due to their complex interdependencies. Therefore, to reduce the total power consumption of the data center, it is not sufficient to reduce the power consumption of each piece of equipment, but one should consider the dependencies among the data center equipment. In other words, a coordinated control of the operational settings accounting for interdependencies among equipment is required to reduce the total power consumption of data centers. In this study, a data center energy management system focusing on the coordinated control of equipment in a data center is proposed. In the proposed system, the operational settings are determined using power consumption prediction that is based on the machine learning methods. We design a data center control system focusing on the task assignment of servers and air conditioner settings, and this system determines their settings based on a genetic algorithm. The proposed system is evaluated by experiments in our data center testbed and the evaluation results indicate that the proposed system reduces the total power consumption of the data center.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5093-2; POD:978-1-5090-5094-9","10.1109/CloudNet.2016.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776583","Coordinated control system;Data center energy management system;Genetic algorithm;Machine learning","Atmospheric modeling;Fans;Heating;Mathematical model;Power demand;Servers;Temperature distribution","Internet of Things;cloud computing;computer centres","Internet of Things;augmented data center infrastructure management system;cloud computing;data center control system;data centers;energy consumption;genetic algorithm;machine learning method","","","","","","","3-5 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reduce the time and resource cost, automatic techniques of test generation have been proposed. These techniques aim to automatically generate test cases to reproduce the scenario of a crashed project. Unfortunately, due to the lack of a detailed comprehension of the source code, a generated test case may fail in reproducing an expected crash. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to reproducible bug detection. This approach predicts whether a crash is difficult to reproduce or not via training a classifier based on historical reproducible crash data. If a crash is difficult to reproduce, it is better to assign the crash to a developer, instead of using an automatic technique of test generation. Our work can help to prioritize crashes and to save the cost of developers.

These techniques consider all developers' historical change data to build a global prediction model. In practice, since developers have their own coding preferences and behavioral patterns, which causes different defect patterns, a separate change classification model for each developer can help to improve performance. Jiang, Tan, and Kim refer to this problem as personalized change classification, and they propose PCC+ to solve this problem. A software project has a number of developers; for a developer, building a prediction model not only based on his/her change data, but also on other relevant developers' change data can further improve the performance of change classification. In this paper, we propose a more accurate technique named collective personalized change classification (CPCC), which leverages a multiobjective genetic algorithm. For a project, CPCC first builds a personalized prediction model for each developer based on his/her historical data. Next, for each developer, CPCC combines these models by assigning different weights to these models with the purpose of maximizing two objective functions (i.e., F1-scores and cost effectiveness). To further improve the prediction accuracy, we propose CPCC+ by combining CPCC with PCC proposed by Jiang, Tan, and Kim To evaluate the benefits of CPCC+ and CPCC, we perform experiments on six large software projects from different communities: Eclipse JDT, Jackrabbit, Linux kernel, Lucene, PostgreSQL, and Xorg. The experiment results show that CPCC+ can discover up to 245 more bugs than PCC+ (468 versus 223 for PostgreSQL) if developers inspect the top 20% lines of code that are predicted buggy. In addition, CPCC+ can achieve F1-scores of 0.60-0.75, which are statistically significantly higher than those of PCC+ on all of the six projects.","0018-9529;00189529","","10.1109/TR.2016.2588139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518675","Cost effectiveness;developer;machine learning;multiobjective genetic algorithm;personalized change classification (PCC)","Buildings;Computer bugs;Data models;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Predictive models;Software","genetic algorithms;program debugging","CPCC;Eclipse JDT;Jackrabbit;Linux kernel;Lucene;PCC+;PostgreSQL;Xorg;collective personalized change classification technique;multiobjective genetic algorithm;multiobjective search;personalized prediction model;software project","","","","","","20160721","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A number of neural network accelerators have been recently proposed which can offer high computational capacity/area ratio, but which remain hampered by memory accesses. However, unlike the memory wall faced by processors on general-purpose workloads, the CNNs and DNNs memory footprint, while large, is not beyond the capability of the on-chip storage of a multi-chip system. This property, combined with the CNN/DNN algorithmic characteristics, can lead to high internal bandwidth and low external communications, which can in turn enable high-degree parallelism at a reasonable area cost.

Fine-granularity components of the classifier are distributed across the network by using Distributed Hash Table (DHT) - which provides efficient linking to these components and ensures the system remains fully-distributed. Our experimental results also show that the P2P-GN can produce highly accurate results despite imbalanced data distribution compared to other distributed algorithms (Ivote-DPV, ensemble ID3, ensemble k-NN, and ensemble naive Bayes).","","CD:978-1-4673-8513-8; Electronic:978-1-4673-8515-2; POD:978-1-4673-8516-9; Paper:978-1-4673-8514-5","10.1109/CCI.2016.7778867","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778867","P2P-based classification;distributed classification;distributed machine learning;efficient distributed algorithm","Classification algorithms;Distributed algorithms;Distributed databases;Internet;Pattern recognition;Peer-to-peer computing;Training","file organisation;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing","DHT-based networks;P2P-GN;distributed hash table;distributed pattern recognition;fine-granularity components;fully-distributed pattern recognition algorithm;imbalanced data distribution;imbalanced datasets;single global classifier","","","","","","","13-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These lists of genes are often called genomic signatures and their linkage to phenotype associations may form a significant step in discovering the causation between genotypes and phenotypes. Traditional methods that produce genomic signatures from DNA Microarray data tend to extract significantly different lists under relatively small variations of the training data. That instability hinders the validity of research findings and raises skepticism about the reliability of such methods. In this study, a complete framework for the extraction of stable and reliable lists of candidate genes is presented. The proposed methodology enforces stability of results at the validation step and as a result, it is independent of the feature selection and classification methods used. Furthermore, two different statistical tests are performed in order to assess the statistical significance of the observed results. Moreover, the consistency of the signatures extracted by independent executions of the proposed method is also evaluated. The results of this study highlight the importance of stability issues in genomic signatures, beyond their prediction capabilities.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2016.2633267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7762149","Bioinformatics;Classification;DNA Microarrays;Feature Selection;Machine Learning;Relevance Vector Machine (RVM);Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Bioinformatics;Breast cancer;Data mining;Feature extraction;Genomics;Stability analysis","","","","","","","","20161129","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

One of the key issues related to ANLP is ambiguity. In Arabic language different pronunciation of one word may have a different meaning. Furthermore, ambiguity also has an impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of Machine Translation (MT). The issue of ambiguity has limited the usefulness and accuracy of the translation from Arabic to English. The lack of Arabic resources makes ambiguity problem more complicated. Additionally, the orthographic level of representation cannot specify the exact meaning of the word. This paper looked at the diacritics of Arabic language and used them to disambiguate an ambiguous word. The proposed approach of word sense disambiguation used Diacritizer application to Diacritize Arabic text. Then find the most accurate sense of an ambiguous word using Naïve Bayes Classifier. Our system gets 91% precision, and 12.11% error rate. This experimental study proves that using Arabic Diacritics with Naïve Bayes Classifier enhances the accuracy of choosing the appropriate sense for ambiguous Arabic words.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1269-5; POD:978-1-5090-1270-1","10.1109/ICIEV.2016.7760152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760152","Arabic natural language processing;Machine learning;Machine translation;Naïve Bayes Classifier;word sense disambiguation","Classification algorithms;Context;Hidden Markov models;Natural language processing;Silicon;Standards;Training","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis","ANLP;Arabic diacritics;Arabic natural language processing;Arabic text diacritizer;MT;machine translation;naïve Bayes classifier;supervised approach;word sense disambiguation","","","","","","","13-14 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aims of this paper are threefold: First, to integrate a Class-Association Rules (CARs) into the process of Multi-factor Authentication Based on Multimodal Biometrics (MFA-MB) for CC; Second, defines a new metric to measure the User Experience and; Third, exhibits an algorithm to authenticate cloud SaaS/PaaS Users with an enhanced MFA-MB scheme. Since, CARs are used to predict the most expected Multimodal Biometric Authentication (MBA) in the basis of Users' authentication habits, mined from their historical authentication data sets, which guarantees continuously improving their Experience. The integration of CARs in the CC authentication process allows also to identify the actual context (Time, Place, Device, etc.) which impacts the choice of biometrics used in MBA according to one User's situation. Therefore, this will help to increase the authentication security level using MBA at a decreased time and improved user experience.

Data from sensors of petrochemical industries need to be timely operated because of time sensitivity and it is hard to achieve associated information from sensors located in production sites. To this end, we propose a three-level framework based on improved back propagation (TLBP). The real-time data streams are processed according to the arriving time in input layer. At the same time, a neuron-optimizing solution is introduced in learning process to deal with redundant and invalid neurons, thereby accelerating the response speed of learning and reducing the prediction time. Finally, we propose an improved mechanism of the multidimensional learning factor to lower the learning error and higher convergence rate. Meanwhile, to fulfill the distributed prediction on leak-points, we see one three-level data-processing unit as a logic machine with multiple operators. Using the assignment scheduling, the general scheduling problem is split into the common subproblem of every operator and the system overhead is reduced. With the processed data we can obtain the relative location or diffusion radius of leak-points, as well as the area of leak-points. Simulation results show that the TLBP performs better than related algorithms in different metrics. Besides, the adaptability of TLBP is verified in leak-points prediction of petrochemical equipment from the processed data.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2016.2537788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7423729","Back propagation (BP);distributed computing;industrial wireless sensor networks;intelligent data processing;leak-points prediction;machine learning;petrochemical industries","Convergence;Data processing;Joining processes;Neurons;Petrochemicals;Prediction algorithms;Sensors","backpropagation;chemical engineering computing;data handling;petrochemicals;scheduling","TLBP;assignment scheduling;backpropagation;distributed data processing;intelligent leak-points prediction;logic machine;multidimensional learning factor;neuron-optimizing solution;petrochemical equipment leak-points prediction;petrochemical industries;three-level data-processing unit;three-level framework","","4","","","","20160302","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specifically, we use the Random Forest (RF) machine learning (ML) method to predict the effectiveness of software engineering teamwork learning based on data collected during student team project development. These data include over 100 objective and quantitative Team Activity Measures (TAM) obtained from monitoring and measuring activities of student teams during the creation of their final class project in our joint software engineering classes which ran concurrently at San Francisco State University (SFSU), Fulda University (Fulda) and Florida Atlantic University (FAU). In this paper we provide the first RF analysis results done at SFSU on our full data set covering four years of our joint SE classes. These data include 74 student teams with over 380 students, totaling over 30000 discrete data points. These data are grouped into 11 time intervals, each measuring important phases of project development during the class (e.g. early requirement gathering and design, development, testing and delivery). We briefly elaborate on the methods of data collection and describe the data itself. We then show prediction results of the RF analysis applied to this full data set. Results show that we are able to detect student teams who are bound to fail or need attention in early class time with good (about 70%) accuracy. Moreover, the variable importance analysis shows that the features (TAM measures) with high predictive power make intuitive sense, such as late delivery/late responses, time used to help each other, and surprisingly statistics on commit messages to the code repository, etc. In summary, we believe we demonstrate the viability of using ML on objective and quantitative team activity measures to predict student lea- ning of software engineering teamwork, and point to easy-to-measure factors that can be used to guide educators and software engineering managers to implement early intervention for teams bound to fail.

After preprocessing of the input GPR images, a novel thresholding method is applied to separate the regions of interest from background. A novel column-connection clustering (C3) algorithm is then applied to separate the regions of interest from each other. Subsequently, a machine learnt model is applied to identify hyperbolic signatures from outputs of the C3 algorithm, and a hyperbola is fitted to each such signature with an orthogonal-distance hyperbola fitting algorithm. The novel clustering algorithm C3 is a central component of the proposed system, which enables the identification of hyperbolic signatures and hyperbola fitting. Only two features are used in the machine learning algorithm, which is easy to train using a small set of training data. An orthogonal-distance hyperbola fitting algorithm for “south-opening” hyperbolae is introduced in this work, which is more robust and accurate than algebraic hyperbola fitting algorithms. The proposed method can successfully recognize and fit hyperbolic signatures with intersections with others, hyperbolic signatures with distortions, and incomplete hyperbolic signatures with one leg fully or largely missed. As an additional novel contribution, formulas to compute an initial “south-opening” hyperbola directly from a set of given points are derived, which make the system more efficient. The parameters obtained by fitting hyperbolae to hyperbolic signatures are very important features; they can be used to estimate the location and size of the related target objects and the average propagation velocity of the electromagnetic wave in the medium.

Transfer learning has recently emerged as a way of exploiting previously acquired knowledge to solve new yet similar problems much more quickly and effectively. In contrast to classical data-driven machine learning methods, transfer learning methods exploit the knowledge accumulated from data in auxiliary domains to facilitate predictive modeling in the current domain. A significant number of transfer learning methods that address classification tasks have been proposed, but studies on transfer learning in the case of regression problems are still scarce. This study focuses on using transfer learning techniques to handle regression problems in a domain that has insufficient training data. We propose an original fuzzy regression transfer learning method, based on fuzzy rules, to address the problem of estimating the value of the target for regression. A Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy regression model is developed to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target domain.

"CoLUA: Automatically Predicting Configuration Bug Reports and Extracting Configuration Options","W. Wen; T. Yu; J. H. Hayes","Dept. of Comput.

Software organizations often use bug tracking systems to manage bug reports collected from developers and users. In order for software developers to understand and reproduce configuration bugs, it is vital for them to know whether a bug in the bug report is related to configuration issues, this is not often easily discerned due to a lack of easy to spot terminology in the bug reports. In addition, to locate and fix a configuration bug, a developer needs to know which configuration options are associated with the bug. To address these two problems, we introduce CoLUA, a two-step automated approach that combines natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. In the first step, CoLUA selects features from the textual information in the bug reports, and uses various machine learning techniques to build classification models, developers can use these models to label a bug report as either a configuration bug report or a non-configuration bug report. In the second step, CoLUA identifies which configuration options are involved in the labeled configuration bug reports. We evaluate CoLUA on 900 bug reports from three large open source software systems. The results show that CoLUA predicts configuration bug reports with high accuracy and that it effectively identifies the root causes of configuration options.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9002-6; POD:978-1-4673-9003-3","10.1109/ISSRE.2016.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7774516","bug reports;configuration;machine learning","Browsers;Computer bugs;Databases;Debugging;Feature extraction;Organizations;Software","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;program debugging;public domain software;software fault tolerance;text analysis","CoLUA;bug tracking systems;classification models;configuration bug report prediction;configuration options;information retrieval;machine learning;machine learning techniques;natural language processing;open source software systems;software developers;software failures;textual information;two-step automated approach","","","","","","","23-27 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, a trade-off between precision and coverage is hard to find, and it depends on the methodology used to build the lexicon. Manually annotated lexica provide a high precision but lack in coverage, whereas automatic derivation from pre-existing knowledge guarantees high coverage at the cost of a lower precision. Since the automatic derivation of prior polarities is less time consuming than manual annotation, there has been a great bloom of these approaches, in particular based on the SentiWordNet resource. In this paper, we compare the most frequently used techniques based on SentiWordNet with newer ones and blend them in a learning framework (a so called `ensemble method'). By taking advantage of manually built prior polarity lexica, our ensemble method is better able to predict the prior value of unseen words and to outperform all the other SentiWordNet approaches. Using this technique we have built SentiWords, a prior polarity lexicon of approximately 155,000 words, that has both a high precision and a high coverage. We finally show that in sentiment analysis tasks, using our lexicon allows us to outperform both the single metrics derived from SentiWordNet and popular manually annotated sentiment lexica.","1949-3045;19493045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2015.2476456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7239537","Natural language processing;machine learning;text analysis","Context modeling;Crowdsourcing;Frequency modulation;Measurement;Sentiment analysis;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);sentiment analysis","SentiWordNet resource;ensemble method;learning framework;prior polarity lexicon;sentiment analysis","","0","","","","20150903","Oct.-Dec. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in the actual operation of modern power system, unstable samples constitute only a very small minority of the cases. Besides, the traditional random forest algorithm does not work very well on imbalanced data. To tackle the problem, weighted random forest is adopted to lean the interest towards to the correct classification of rare class, and improve the prediction performance.

It compares traditional linguistic machine learning features, such as ""bag of words"", with more advanced features, such as subject-action-object, and evaluates combinations of machine learning features derived from the natural language and features taken from the issue tracking system meta-data. Our investigation shows that some combinations of machine learning features derived from natural language and the issue tracking system meta-data outperform traditional approaches. We show that issues or data fields (e.g. descriptions or comments), which contain software feature requests, can be identified reasonably well, but hardly the exact sentence.

Such estimations are useful to decide if deploying AI models makes economical sense, reported to the specific problem, data availability, existing domain expertise, and deployment costs. This framework leads to analysis of interesting subtle concepts like the difference between knowing the future and being able to predict the future, even if the prediction would be perfect. Such concepts are useful for benchmarking the efficiency of the model. As an example of applying the framework, real data from a bank was used to determine ways to decrease the operating costs by convincing new customers to opt for electronic statements. The results show that AI models are useful every time when heuristics can be successfully applied, but the improvement brought by AI may not always be spectacular, even in the case of complete information and perfect model.

Nevertheless, a general, structured understanding of this integration is missing. To address this, we systematically studied the visual analytics and visualization literature to investigate how analysts interact with automatic DR techniques. The results reveal seven common interaction scenarios that are amenable to interactive control such as specifying algorithmic constraints, selecting relevant features, or choosing among several DR algorithms. We investigate specific implementations of visual analysis systems integrating DR, and analyze ways that other machine learning methods have been combined with DR. Summarizing the results in a “human in the loop” process model provides a general lens for the evaluation of visual interactive DR systems.

The computation of RBF kernel is comprised of the squared Euclidean distance and the exponential function. In the first implementation, two components are implemented in bipolar format and the exponential function is designed based on the finite state machine (FSM) method. The second implementation computes the squared Euclidean distance with bipolar input and unipolar output. The exponential function is implemented in unipolar format based on the Maclaurin expansion.

The new feature extractor demands significantly less computational power, memory, and energy. Its SW implementation consumes only 22 percent of the energy used by a commercial product and its HW implementation only 12 percent. The dual-objective feature selection enabled an energy saving of up to 93 percent. Comparing the most energy-efficient SW implementation (new extractor and DT classifier) with an equivalent HW implementation, the HW version consumes only 5.7 percent of the energy used by the SW version.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2016.2560839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463065","Low-power design;classifier design and evaluation;energy-aware systems;feature evaluation and selection;hardware description languages;machine learning;network-level security and protection;security and privacy protection","Classification algorithms;Energy efficiency;Engines;Feature extraction;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Software","Bayes methods;decision trees;embedded systems;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power aware computing;security of data","Naive-Bayes;battery-powered devices;decision tree;detailed energy measurements;dual-objective feature selection;embedded systems;energy consumption reduction;energy saving;energy-efficient anomaly-based intrusion detection engine;feature extraction;k-nearest neighbors;machine learning classifiers;network accesses;network security algorithms","","","","","","20160429","Jan. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This creates the need for PV forecasting based on a distributed network of sites, which has been an area of active research in the past few years. This paper describes a new statistical approach to PV forecasting, with two key contributions. First, we describe a “local regularization” scheme, wherein the PV energy at a given site is only attempted to be predicted based on measurements on geographically nearby sites. Second, we describe a means of incorporating wind velocities into our prediction, which we term “wind expansion"", and show that this scheme is robust to errors in specification of the velocities. Both these extensions are shown to significantly improve the accuracy of PV prediction.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2724-8; POD:978-1-5090-2725-5","10.1109/PVSC.2016.7749808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7749808","Machine learning algorithms;Solar energy;Solar power generation","Clouds;Forecasting;Predictive models;Sensors;Wind forecasting;Wind speed","load forecasting;photovoltaic power systems;power system management","PV forecasting;PV production;distributed solar prediction;electricity grid management;local regularisation scheme;photovoltaic systems;residential PV systems;wind expansion;wind velocity","","","","","","","5-10 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Stealth malware in particular poses an increased threat because it is specifically designed to evade detection mechanisms, spreading dormant, in the wild for extended periods of time, gathering sensitive information or positioning itself for a high-impact zeroday attack. Policing the growing attack surface requires the development of efficient anti-malware solutions with improved generalization to detect novel types of malware and resolve these occurrences with as little burden on human experts as possible. In this paper, we survey malicious stealth technologies as well as existing solutions for detecting and categorizing these countermeasures autonomously. While machine learning offers promising potential for increasingly autonomous solutions with improved generalization to new malware types, both at the network level and at the host level, our findings suggest that several flawed assumptions inherent to most recognition algorithms prevent a direct mapping between the stealth malware recognition problem and a machine learning solution. The most notable of these flawed assumptions is the closed world assumption: that no sample belonging to a class outside of a static training set will appear at query time. We present a formalized adaptive open world framework for stealth malware recognition and relate it mathematically to research from other machine learning domains.","1553-877X;1553877X","","10.1109/COMST.2016.2636078","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778160","Anomaly Detection;Extreme Value Theory;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning;Malware;Novelty Detection;Open Set;Outlier Detection;Recognition;Rootkits;Stealth","Command and control systems;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Malware;Operating systems;Tutorials","","","","1","","","","20161208","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Furthermore, a Back-Propagation neural network is utilized in order to get the relationship between the foot force and the gait phase. The result shows that the sub-stance phases can be recognized by foot force with an accurate rate of 92.07%, which proves that the plantar force is closely related to gait phase, especially the stance phase, and the sensor and the method proposed can be applied in clinical rehabilitation and some human-machine system with high reliability.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0768-4; POD:978-1-5090-0769-1","10.1109/IHMSC.2016.218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783890","Back-Propagation neural network;Flexible pressure sensor;Gait;Machine learning;Stance phase","Exoskeletons;Foot;Force;Legged locomotion;Pressure sensors;Robot sensing systems","backpropagation;gait analysis;image motion analysis;man-machine systems;neural nets;pressure sensors","abnormal gait;backpropagation neural network;camera-based motion system;clinical rehabilitation;human-machine system control;in-shoe flexible pressure sensors;lower limb diseases;plantar force;stance phase recognization","","","","","","","27-28 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose CrackForest, a novel road crack detection framework based on random structured forests, to address these issues. Our contributions are shown as follows: 1) apply the integral channel features to redefine the tokens that constitute a crack and get better representation of the cracks with intensity inhomogeneity; 2) introduce random structured forests to generate a high-performance crack detector, which can identify arbitrarily complex cracks; and 3) propose a new crack descriptor to characterize cracks and discern them from noises effectively.

With advanced AR technology, artificial information about the environment and its objects can be overlaid on the real world. This paper presents a complete augmented reality process for a video sequence captured by a moving camera. The main goal is to construct a full chain composed of 4 blocks that correspond to the main steps of augmented reality process: feature detection, feature extraction, feature matching and image registration. Our work proposes an improved technique for image augmentation, starting from feature detection and ending by image registration. We used the well-known techniques (e.g. SIFT, SURF, etc.) for features detection and extraction in order to compare their performance. Furthermore, we added a features learning step (using SVM, KNN and SRC) to improve the image registration process. The final full chain uses the best method in each block. This best combination is then applied on all video frames taken by the camera. Thereafter, we obtain a video showing the augmented object instead of the real one.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5281-3; POD:978-1-5090-5282-0","10.1109/IMCET.2016.7777429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7777429","Augmented reality;features extraction and detection;image processing;image registration;machine learning","Augmented reality;Classification algorithms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image registration;Transforms","augmented reality;cameras;feature extraction;image capture;image matching;image registration;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;support vector machines;transforms;video signal processing","AR technology;KNN;SIFT;SRC;SURF;SVM;artificial information;augmented reality;feature detection;feature extraction;feature learning;feature matching;image augmentation;image registration;moving camera;video frames;video sequence","","","","","","","2-4 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Support vector machines are one of the widely used machine learning algorithms for data classification. SVMs are by default binary classifiers, extending them to multi-class classifiers is a challenging on-going research problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach to constructing the multi-class classification function, where the structure and properties of the support vectors are exploited without altering the training procedure. Our contribution is based on the insight that one is not restricted to using the hyperplane-based decision function, resulting from the mathematical optimization problem. The proposed classification procedure considers the notion of distance between vectors in feature space. We show how, under the assumption of a normalized kernel, the distance between two vectors in feature space can be expressed solely in terms of their inner product. We apply both the original and proposed methods on synthetic datasets in a simulation setting, and then we argue that the proposed distance-based method represents a more rigorous and intuitive measure than the traditional hyperplane-based method.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5281-3; POD:978-1-5090-5282-0","10.1109/IMCET.2016.7777430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7777430","Machine learning;classification algorithms;kernel;optimization;support vector machines","Computer science;Conferences;Kernel;Optimization;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;support vector machines","binary classifiers;data classification;distance-based approach;hyperplane-based decision function;machine learning;mathematical optimization;multiclass classification;support vector machines","","","","","","","2-4 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trivedi","University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.","IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2016","PP","99","1","11","Existing nighttime vehicle detection methods use color as the primary cue for detecting vehicles. However, complex road and ambient lighting conditions, and camera configurations can influence the effectiveness of such explicit rule and threshold-based methods. In this paper, there are three main contributions. First, we present a novel method to detect vehicles during nighttime involving both learned classifiers and explicit rules, which can operate in the presence of varying ambient lighting conditions. The proposed method that is titled as Vehicle Detection using Active-learning during Nighttime (VeDANt) employs a modified form of active learning for training Adaboost classifiers with Haar-like features using gray-level input images. The hypothesis windows are then further verified using the proposed techniques involving perspective geometries and color information of the taillights. Second, VeDANt is extended to analyze the dynamics of the vehicles during nighttime by detecting three taillight activities-braking, turning left, and turning right. Third, we release three new and fully annotated Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles-Night data sets with over 5000 frames for evaluation and benchmarking, which capture a variety of complex traffic and lighting conditions. Such comprehensively annotated and complex public data sets are a first in the area of nighttime vehicle detection. We show that VeDANt is able to detect vehicles during nighttime with over 98% accuracy and less than 1% false detections.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2614545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7750549","Taillight activity analysis;active safety.;machine learning;machine vision;vehicle behavior","Cameras;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Lighting;Training;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","","","","1","","","","20161121","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For potential future advanced driver assistance systems, this can facilitate the situation analysis and risk assessment at road intersections, helping to improve the protection of vulnerable road users. After extracting recorded driving data for nine intersections (featuring over 50 000 crossings) from a database, they are assigned to possible routes and transformed from a time-based representation to a distance-based one. Using random decision forests, the route intent can be predicted with a mean unweighted average recall (UAR) of 0.76 at 30 m before the relevant intersection center, the stopping intent prediction scores a mean UAR of 0.78.","2379-8858;23798858","","10.1109/TIV.2016.2617625","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590077","Advanced driver assistance systems;car fleet data;driver state and intent recognition;driving data;machine learning","Automobiles;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intelligent vehicles;Roads;Urban areas","automobiles;data handling;driver information systems;feature selection;risk management;traffic engineering computing","UAR;car fleet data;distance-based representation;distinctive feature selection;driver assistance systems;driving data extraction;human-driven vehicles;mean unweighted average recall;random decision forests;risk assessment;road intersections;route intent prediction;situation analysis;stopping intent prediction;time-based representation;vehicle state","","","","","","20161013","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This implies the need for convenient solutions to simplify screening and diagnosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of a novel wireless system in detecting breathing and snoring episodes during sleep. Methods: A wireless acoustic sensor was elaborated and implemented. Segmentation (based on spectral thresholding and heuristics) and classification of all breathing episodes during recording were implemented through a mobile application. The system was evaluated on 1,520 manually labeled episodes registered from 40 real-world, whole-night recordings of 16 generally healthy subjects. Results: The differentiation between normal breathing and snoring had 88.8% accuracy. As the system is intended for screening, high specificity of 95% is reported. Conclusions: The system is a compromise between non-medical phone applications and medical sleep studies. The presented approach enables the study to be repetitive, personal, and inexpensive. It has additional value in the form of wellrecorded data which are reliable and comparable. Significance: The system opens unexplored possibilities in sleep monitoring and study enabling a multi-night recording strategy involving the collection and analysis of abundant data from thousands of people.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2632976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7762101","machine learning;sleep breathing disorders;smartphone application;snoring;tracheal sound analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Informatics;Medical diagnostic imaging;Sleep apnea;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","20161129","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
