It can combine evidences from different evidence sources. Therefore, it has been successfully applied in data fusion and target recognition. However, the multiplying strategy in D-S evidence theory results in an inherent drawback when dealing with conflicting evidences. In order to efficiently combine highly conflicting evidences, a new D-S evidence combination strategy based on evidence classification and weight coefficients is put forward. In this method, firstly, evidences are classified into several subsets based on the principle that the evidences in each subset are consistent with each other. Secondly, a new method of determining weight coefficients is proposed. At last, all the combination results are integrated with weight rule to form the final result. Experiment results show that this method can process conflicting evidences more effectively compared with other existing methods.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620388","Conflicting evidences;D-S evidence theory;Evidence Classification;Weight coefficient","Convergence;Cybernetics;Machine learning;Space technology;Sun;Target recognition;Uncertainty","pattern classification;uncertainty handling","D-S evidence theory;conflicting evidences combination strategy;data fusion;evidence classification;target recognition;uncertainty problems;weight coefficients","","0","","9","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Market pattern means the tendency of the stock market. We often know the formation of the market pattern, but we often donpsilat know what to take a position. In this article, we propose a stock valuation model with asset allocation strategy which could provide a suitable trading strategy for each market pattern. In this model, genetic algorithm is used to optimize the fair stock price range, anticipative rate of investment, and trading moment. The cubic spline provides a powerful numerical approximation over the shape of asset allocation curve.

However, difficulties exist because there are mixed binary and continuous variables in this model for which the traditionally used optimization algorithms suitable for continuous variables cannot be employed in the realization of the biclustering process.

The end points of isolated utterance can be determined accurately enough in the training and recognition process. A function for the distance measure between two speech blocks is derived. The feature vector is then defined. The speech model for each word is represented as a left-to-right finite-state machine. Viterbi algorithm and EM algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal model for each isolated word. When an utterance is to be recognized, the Viterbi algorithm is applied to search for the model which gives the smallest accumulated distance along the optimum path. The performance of the proposed recognition process is evaluated by comparing to the method using DTW. The comparison is in three aspects: namely, the recognition accuracy, the noise-resistance capability, and the effectiveness of speech enhancement pre-processing. Experiments showed that the proposed speech recognition process is superior to DTW in these three aspects.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620977","Critical-band-wavelet-packet transform;DTW;EM algorithm;Left-to-right finite-state machine;Viterbi algorithm","Asia;Cybernetics;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Isolation technology;Machine learning;Speech coding;Speech enhancement;Speech recognition;Viterbi algorithm","finite state machines;speech enhancement;speech recognition;wavelet transforms","Viterbi algorithm;left-to-right finite-state machine;noisy isolated-word recognition;optimum path;speech enhancement;speech recognition process","","0","","14","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security becomes one of the major concerns when there are potential attacks against sensor network nodes. Thus we have designed fundamental security in disk shaped to provide basic security elements that can be implemented in various sensor nodes.

Abundant algorithms have been proposed for automatic construction of concept hierarchy. A typical application of such algorithms is constructing directories for documents in information retrieval community. However, the research result can not be directly adopted for automatic construction of concept hierarchies for objects with identifiers only, such as items in market basket database where items have no attribute and only similarities between items are available. So, the metrics for directories for documents are not suitable for hierarchies for identifier-only data. In this paper, we propose a measurement that considers the unevenness of similarities among objects in the child nodes. We use the unevenness value to express the balance of concept hierarchies. For constructing a concept hierarchy, we propose a hierarchical clustering with join/merge decision (HCJMD) which is modified from hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621097","Concept hierarchy;data mining;hierarchical agglomerative clustering","Application software;Computer science;Conference management;Cybernetics;Data engineering;Data mining;Frequency;Information management;Information retrieval;Machine learning","data mining;information retrieval;pattern clustering","concept hierarchy;data mining;hierarchical agglomerative clustering;hierarchical clustering with join-merge decision;information retrieval;unevenness value","","0","","8","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the basis of a Web server log, anonymous sessions are determined in the form of a 65 dimensional vector, where dimensions represent individual Web system pages. Each dimension comprises the value of a measure of user interest in a page during a given session. This value is calculated as a ratio of time user spent visiting a given page to the total time of a session. Then the whole set of sessions is clustered using HCM (Hard C-Means) algorithm. The resulting clusters are assumed as the user activity patterns and among them clusters dominated by a page are selected as those where the user interest value exceeds a given threshold value e.g. 50 per cent. The sessions of named users, registered in the system, are determined using an application log of user activity. The frequencies of named user sessions, comprised by individual clusters, are calculated for a given period of time e.g. one month.

Learning methods were introduced into intrusion detection to automatically improve the performance using history data. Yet high quality data requires heavy labor of experts or expensive monitoring process. Meanwhile, IDS should minimize a nonuniform cost of the misclassification. In the paper, we aim to reduce the burden of labeling data for constructing the intrusion detection classifier with the least misclassification cost. We proposed a novel active cost-sensitive learning method for intrusion detection using the technologies of active learning and cost-sensitive learning. The proposed method uses a popular cost-sensitive learning method Metacost as the base classifier and a sampling criterion of the largest misclassification cost. The results of the experiments on intrusion detection datasets of KDDCUP 99 show that the proposed method is effective.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620568","Active Learning;Cost-sensitive learning;Intrusion detection","Costs;Cybernetics;Engines;History;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Learning systems;Machine learning;Protection;Sampling methods","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS;KDDCUP 99;Metacost;active cost-sensitive learning method;computer systems protection;intrusion detection systems","","1","","20","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unobserved values are caused either by missing values or by unevenly sampling rates, and cannot be estimated accurately by straightforward interpolation due to very noisy and few replicated data. According to prior knowledge that each gene time-series is constrained in both time and frequency domains, POCS formulates these constraints by multiple convex sets and uses an iteratively convergent procedure to find the optimal value that satisfies all constraints by prior knowledge. To estimate the unobserved values, we use the cubic spline method to estimate the initial value and use POCS to find the optimal value iteratively. We show that POCS can improve the estimation of unobserved time-points with lower normalized root mean squared error compared with the statistical spline estimation for the continuous representation of microarray time-series data.

Experimental results obtained in simulation and with real robot on different terrains demonstrate that this method is more close to real pose of mobile robot than to calculate only with the pitch.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620722","Dead reckoning;Kinematic model;Mobile robot;Proprioceptive sensor;Wheel-ground contact angle","Cybernetics;Dead reckoning;Machine learning;Mobile robots;Navigation;Optical fiber sensors;Optical fibers;Optical sensors;Position measurement;Robot kinematics","distance measurement;mobile robots;motion control;navigation;path planning;position control;robot kinematics;sensors","complex terrain;dead reckoning;fiber optic gyro;mobile robot navigation;odometry;proprioceptive sensors;relative motion trajectory estimation;rigid-body kinematic constraints;tilt sensor;wheel-ground contact angle","","1","","8","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the definitions of complex rough variable and primary norm are introduced. Then, the definitions of the complex empirical risk functional, the complex expected risk functional, and complex empirical risk minimization principle about samples corrupted by noise are proposed. Finally, the key theorem of learning theory based on complex rough samples corrupted by noise is proposed and proved.

With tight connections and cooperation between supply chain members, the supply chain can increase values for end customers and gains competitive advantage. Meanwhile, such relationships also create win-win situations among supply chain members. Thus, selecting supply chain members which includes supplier selection is a very important task in the supply chain management. Many studies have mentioned the importance of supplier selection in supply chain management, and have established methods and criteria for supplier selection. However, few studies considered the supplier selection from the perspective of the entire supply chain. Thus, this study proposes a new supplier selection approach that considers the entire supply chain in order to maximize the performance of the entire supply chain. We believe that our approach can be served as a supplier selection tool for improving supply chain performance.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621091","Genetic algorithm;Supplier selection;Supply chain","Costs;Cybernetics;Genetic algorithms;Industrial relations;Information management;Machine learning;Performance evaluation;Productivity;Supply chain management;Supply chains","genetic algorithms;supply chain management","industry competition;supplier selection tool;supply chain management","","0","","17","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method of semantic-layering and semantic-abstracting step by step is adopted, viz. the abstract from primary perceptive level to high-level perceptive level by all kinds of perceptive components and the abstract from high-level perceptive level to high-level conceptual level by mathematical model such as hierarchical hidden Markov model. MMO is produced by re-engineering MPEG-7 with OWL DL rules, it includes core ontology, media ontology and domain ontology, the reason for such design is to be convenient to utilize existing ontology(such as MPEG-7 and DOLCE) and easy to be extended and reused.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620670","Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model;Media Understanding;Multimedia Ontology;Semantic Event;Semantic-Abstracting;Semantic-Layering","Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Hidden Markov models;MPEG 7 Standard;Machine learning;Multimedia systems;OWL;Ontologies;Organizing;Sections","hidden Markov models;information retrieval;meta data;multimedia computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems","MPEG-7;hierarchical hidden Markov model;high-level conceptual world;high-level perceptive level;information retrieval;interoperability;media information understanding-oriented multimedia ontology;semantic gap;semantic metadata sharing;semantic-abstracting step;semantic-layering","","0","","12","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
