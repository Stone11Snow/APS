This paper proposes a novel watermarking scheme for an image. The image is firstly decomposed by multiwavelet transformation, and then the relation among subblocks in the coarsest level of the multiwavelet domain is learned by a back-propagation neural network, which is trained using coefficients in three subblocks as input vectors and corresponding coefficients in another sub-block as output values. Finally a logo watermark is embedded into the multiwavelet domain by adjusting the relation among these subblocks. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the similar one in the literature.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167437","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167437","","Educational institutions;Matrix decomposition;Multiresolution analysis;Neural networks;Pixel;Protection;Robustness;Videos;Watermarking;Wavelet domain","backpropagation;copyright;image processing;multimedia computing;neural nets;watermarking;wavelet transforms","back-propagation neural network;copyright protection;multimedia products;multimedia security;multiwavelet transformation;public watermarking;watermarking","","9","","5","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20030129","2002","3","","1566","1570 vol.3","For most actual problems, especially about production-line optimization problems in complex manufacturing systems, it often needs to process integrally a large amount of different types of uncertain information with complex constraints. In this paper, we construct several types of fuzzy inequality degree in different ways, whose basic analytical properties such as continuity and monotonicity are also considered.

International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20030129","2002","3","","1241","1244 vol.3","This paper introduces a data mining approach to detect fraud behaviors in customs declaration data. Some of the data mining technologies used in this project, such as an easy-to-expand multidimensional criterion data model and a hybrid fraud-detection strategy, are considered. Due to the characteristics of the data distribution in fraud detection applications, it is more difficult to predict the fraud behaviors. However, the easy-to-expand data model with multidimensional-criterion introduced in this paper improves both the accuracy of the model and performance of the algorithm. Since this model has a strong ability of popularization, it can be used as a reference to other similar complex applications.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167400","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167400","","Application software;Business;Data mining;Data models;Data preprocessing;Data processing;Databases;Design methodology;Electronic mail;Inspection","data mining;database management systems;fraud;public administration","attribute construction;data mining;data preprocessing;database;fraud detection;knowledge discovery;multidimensional criterion data model","","8","","13","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rough set theory in data mining, which provides a useful tool to analyze data can help solve the above problem. This paper proposes a novel hybrid method to integrate the rough set theory, genetic algorithm and artificial neural network. Our method consists of two stages: in the first procedure, the rough set theory and genetic algorithm are applied to find relevant factors to the load and the results are used as inputs of the neural network; in the second procedure, an active selection of training sets is carried out by k-nearest neighbors, and the neural network is used to predict the load. The method is characterized not only by using attribute reduction as a preprocessing technique of the neural network, but also presenting an improved attribute reduction algorithm. The prediction accuracy is improved by applying the method on a real power system, which shows that the proposed method is promising for load forecasting in power systems.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167380","","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Data analysis;Data mining;Genetic algorithms;Load forecasting;Neural networks;Power systems;Predictive models;Set theory","data mining;genetic algorithms;load forecasting;neural nets;power system planning;rough set theory","attribute reduction;data mining;genetic algorithm;load forecasting;nearest neighbors;neural network;power system planning;rough set theory","","4","","13","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, two feature selection methods are proposed to reduce the complexity and speed up the handwritten Chinese recognition: one is the ReliefF-Wrapper method which evaluates the original features with the ReliefF method, and then uses the wrapper method to decide the number of features to be selected; and the other is GA-Wrapper that uses genetic algorithm to search the optimal subset of features with high training accuracy. Experiments were performed on 800 most frequently used Chinese characters, with 80,000 handwritten samples.

We propose a continuous prior model with binary line processes. Additionally, the MEG linear inverse problem being reformulated as an optimization, problem acquires a global minimum solution from the posterior energy function, many optimization methods (such as GA, SA, MFA etc.) are investigated in the literature.

However, the data transfer over communication networks inevitably adds some non-deterministic delays in the closed-loop systems. The analysis and design of this type of systems has attracted a great deal of research interest over the world. In this paper, a laboratory system is used to study the issue of non-deterministic delays in a networked control system. The study is based on a physical platform where three computers, functioned as a digital model of a plant, a system identifier and a learning controller respectively, are communicated through an Ethernet. In this system, identification and learning control are based on Gaussian-function neural network algorithms. Some network-induced delay in our three-computer-Ethernet platform is measured and its effect on the control system is analysed. To reduce the detrimental effect caused by the delays, a scheduling approach, tested on our laboratory system with favourable results, is presented in this paper. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, it is believed that it may be possible to apply the proposed approach to some practical networked control systems.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167466","","Communication system control;Communications technology;Control systems;Delay effects;Delay systems;Distributed control;Gaussian processes;Laboratories;Networked control systems;Neural networks","closed loop systems;delays;distributed control;identification;local area networks;neurocontrollers;radial basis function networks;scheduling","Ethernet;Gaussian-basis-function neural network control system;closed-loop systems;data transfer;distributed control systems;identification;laboratory system;learning controller;network-induced delays;networked architectures;networked control systems;nondeterministic delays;scheduling","","2","","14","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on subsequence matching. We propose an efficient approach to compare time series. To simplify the searching process, we first use the KMP algorithm to carry through rough sequence matching. As KMP is a typical algorithm for string matching, we must transform time series into 0-1 string inspired by literature (Keogh and Pazzani,1999); then we quickly. search all rough similar subsequences from major sequence and finally, to reduce the dimension of raw time series data, we use Harr wavelet transform to represent the sequence to be compared and use WT (Wavelet Transformations) coefficients to compute the similarity of two sequences. That we carry out rough matching at first may reduce the numbers of WT and quicken the whole subsequence matching process.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167412","","Application software;Computer science;Data mining;Databases;Discrete wavelet transforms;Electronic mail;Euclidean distance;Partial response channels;Time measurement;Wavelet transforms","computational complexity;data mining;string matching;time series;wavelet transforms","Wavelet Transformations;rough sequence matching;sequence matching;similarity matching;string matching;subsequence matching;time series;time series databases;wavelet transform","","0","","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the Popov hyperstability theorem, an adaptive mechanism is designed to minimize the broad sense predictive output error. Simulation results show that the adaptive reduced-order model has good ability to auto-approximate high-order systems and to compensate the inertial lag.

It is essential that agents can agree on some deals by negotiation tasks, goals and sets of actions. Up to now, various theoretical models have been introduced into the research to cope with the negotiation between agents. How to improve the social rationality of the negotiation is not only one of the main goals, but also a great challenge for researchers, for instance, the process of negotiation is as concise as possible and the deals, as the result of the negotiation between agents, are as reasonable as possible. The superior-and-inferior relationship is pervasive in almost all the social community of the human beings. Inspired by this a new theoretical model of the negotiation is designed in which agents have their own position in the grading system and are able to reason and achieve a set of deals by abiding their situations, relationship and goal structure. Following ""social"" strategies, agents propose, accept or refuse different offers until they reach a ""fair"" agreement. The negotiation model studied in this paper is useful for MAS applications and distributed cooperation problem solving.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167421","","Computational modeling;Computer applications;Computer simulation;Electronic commerce;Humans;Machinery;Multiagent systems;Problem-solving;Sociology;Waste materials","cooperative systems;decision theory;multi-agent systems;problem solving;software agents","cooperative theory;goal structure;multiagent systems;negotiation;problem solving;social rationality;superior-inferior relationship;utility function","","0","","12","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A double control scheme, based on the PID control law and the internal model control strategy, is studied. Because the controller constructed by the neuro-fuzzy model is not very accurate and leads to control performance degradation, the double control scheme is proposed. The experiment study shows that the double control scheme adopted can extend effectively the controllable range and give good robust tracking control performances.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167454","","Automatic control;Continuous-stirred tank reactor;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Inverse problems;Neural networks;Robust control;Weight control","chemical variables control;fuzzy control;fuzzy neural nets;model reference adaptive control systems;neurocontrollers;process control;robust control;three-term control;uncertain systems","CSTR;IMC;PED control law;concentration control;continuous stirred tank reactor;controllable range;double control scheme;internal model control strategy;neuro-fuzzy systems;parameter uncertainty;robust control;robust tracking control performances;system disturbance","","0","","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Region-mapping neural network model for pattern recognition","Yan-Lai Li; Kuan-Quan Wang; D. Zhang","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Harbin Inst. of Technol., China","Proceedings. International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20030129","2002","3","","1541","1545 vol.3","In general, the process for multilayer feedforward neural network in pattern recognition is composed of two phases: training and classifying. The aim of the training phase is to make it possible for the network output to meet the desired output given by the training patterns. It demands a map of point to point, which is so strict that it often causes the criterion inconsistence between training and classifying. Consequently, the recognition rate would be decreased. The region-mapping model has changed the output space from one point to a certain supervisor region so that it has overcome the shortcoming of the inconsistent problem between training and testing as a common multilayer perceptron (MLP) does. Furthermore, it can save much of the computing time by mapping the input data to an output area rather than an output point. This paper presents a region-mapping model with quarter hyper globe as a supervisor region. The gradient decent algorithm is applied to this model. In order to illustrate the effect of our propounded model, a handwritten letter recognition problem was carried out in an experiment. Moment invariant features are used as input parameters. The simulation results show that the region-mapping model has much better characteristics than those common multiplayer perceptrons. Also, the quarter hyper globe rule is more reasonable than the hypercube one.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167468","","Computer networks;Computer science;Electronic mail;Feedforward neural networks;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Nonhomogeneous media;Pattern recognition;Testing","feedforward neural nets;handwritten character recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural network;handwritten character recognition;input data mapping;moment invariant features;multilayer perceptron;neural network;pattern recognition;region-mapping model;supervisor region;training phase","","0","","4","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20030129","2002","3","","1546","1549 vol.3","This paper represents a common target-independent solution to mandarin speech recognition engine of the dialogue system on a specified domain. The dialogue system on a specified domain often has many grammar limitations and semantic limitations, and these limitations can be used to guide the process of speech recognition. This paper presents a common solution to the problem of limitation information. Every dialogue system on a specified domain has its own keywords and all these keywords can be clustered into several classes according to their meaning and their parts of speech. Then we can collect sentences on the specified domain to form a sentence corpus and abstract grammar from sentences in this corpus by using these keyword classes. All the grammar can form a finite state network and this network can be used in the decoder process. When this solution is applied to a new domain, what we should do is to replace the keyword definition file and sentences corpus file. By using this solution we can get a detection rate of higher than 85%. When this speech recognition engine was applied to a dialogue system ""EasyFlight"", a flight information system, a good performance was achieved.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167469","","Cities and towns;Decoding;Engines;Information systems;Laboratories;Man machine systems;Natural languages;Poles and towers;Speech recognition;Target recognition","grammars;interactive systems;speech recognition","decoder network;dialogue system;grammar limitations;keywords;mandarin speech recognition engine;semantic limitations;target-independent solution;time normalization","","0","","4","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
