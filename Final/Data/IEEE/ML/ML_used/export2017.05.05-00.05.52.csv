In this paper, a fast and robust skew estimation method is proposed based on low-rank matrix decomposition, which seeks an affine transformation that can be used to implement the correction. As the rank of a matrix is a natural measure of regularity and symmetry of images, a misaligned scanned document image is assumed to be correct when the rank of the texture extracted from the image itself is the minimum. Therefore, the skew correction problem can be considered as a matrix rank minimization problem.

Finally, the new fusion image is obtained by inverse HSI transform. Compared with the traditional HSI method, experiment results shows that the proposed strategy not only increases information entropy and average gradient of fusion image, but also decreases spectral bias index. Therefore, the proposed strategy is better than traditional HSI method.

However, the method may have two kinds of bias when solving regression problems: bias in the feature selection stage and bias in solving the regression problem. In this paper, we propose a new bias-correction algorithm that uses bias correction based on the QRF. To correct the first kind of bias, we propose a new scheme for feature sampling that allows to select good features for growing trees. The first level QRF is built based on this. For the second kind of bias, the residual term of the first level QRF model is used as the response feature to train the second level QRF model for bias correction. The second level model is then used to compute bias-corrected predictions. In our experiments, the proposed algorithm dramatically reduces prediction errors and outperforms most of the existing regression random forests models for both synthetic and well-known real-world data sets.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4217-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4215-2; POD:978-1-4799-4214-5","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009082","Bias Correction;Data mining;High-Dimensional Data;Quantile Regression Forests;Random Forests","Abstracts;Breast;Electronic mail;Predictive models;Radio frequency;Rivers;Servomotors","data mining;feature selection;nonparametric statistics;random processes;regression analysis;sampling methods;trees (mathematics)","QRF model;bias-corrected prediction;bias-corrected quantile regression forests;bias-correction algorithm;data mining;feature sampling;feature selection stage;growing trees;high-dimensional data;nonGaussian conditional distribution;nonparametric regression method;prediction accuracy;prediction error;real-world data set;regression problem;regression random forests model;response feature;synthetic data set","","0","","14","","","13-16 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And then the relevant images are updated by making use of the relationships between semantic concepts. In the next stage, a hybrid annotation model is proposed to annotate images. On one hand, we present a baseline method to transfer labels from relevant images to unlabeled image according to global visual features. On the other hand, regional visual features are extracted to build a probabilistic model for image annotation. Finally, the two annotation results are fused by a simple weighted algorithm.

However, both goals are often contradicted to each other. Owing to this, the main idea of this paper is to embed the secret bit sequence into pixel groups by using the summation of neighboring pixel values and the achieved parity of Least Significant Digit (LSD). The summation method utilizes the concept of pixel groups from the method of pixel value differencing (PVD) but not using the difference values for data hiding. Instead, the decimal representation of LSD summation relationship from two neighboring pixels is adopted for adjusting pixel values for data hiding. At the same time, the parity of the second pixel value is used for increasing one more hidden-bit while using the summation relationship for data hiding. Data extraction can be done in the reverse direction. Therefore, the overall hiding capacity can be greatly improved. Experimental results show that the proposed data hiding algorithm can have better performance than normal PVD methods. Also, the better image quality can be assured.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4217-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4215-2; POD:978-1-4799-4214-5","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009146","Capacity;Data hiding;Parity;Summation;Tracking","Abstracts;Frequency-domain analysis","data encapsulation;image processing","LSD parity;LSD summation relationship;data extraction;decimal representation;image quality;least significant digit;neighboring pixel values;novel high-capacity data hiding technique;pixel groups;pixel value differencing;secret bit sequence;summation method","","0","","11","","","13-16 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

FCM and its variations all require an appropriately predefined number of clusters for a given set of data in order to obtain a correct clustering result However, an optimal number of clusters is usually unknown. Mok et al. proposed a robust adaptive clustering analysis method to identify the desired number of clusters and produce a reliable clustering solution at the same time based on a judgment matrix which represents the clustering relationship between any two data points. When applying the Mok's method to image segmentation, the method becomes very impractical because the judgment matrix is too huge to be handled efficiently. In this paper, a more efficient clustering analysis method is proposed for segmenting images with noise. The efficiency comes from the size of the judgment matrix which is only 256 by 256. Experimental results show that our method is better than Mok's method for segmenting both synthetic and real images with noise.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4217-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4215-2; POD:978-1-4799-4214-5","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009657","Clustering analysis;Fuzzy c-means;Image segmentation;Judgment matrix","Abstracts;Image segmentation;Optical imaging;Optical sensors","fuzzy set theory;image segmentation;matrix algebra;pattern clustering","FCM;Mok method;data clustering method;fuzzy c-means;image pixels;image segmentation;judgment matrix;robust adaptive clustering analysis","","0","","8","","","13-16 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other existing techniques for image authentication.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4217-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4215-2; POD:978-1-4799-4214-5","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009136","Content-based copy detection;Discrete Fourier transform;Radon transform","Abstracts;Image segmentation;Matrix decomposition;Media;Robustness;Shearing;Vectors","Radon transforms;discrete Fourier transforms;discrete cosine transforms;feature extraction;image coding;message authentication","DCT coefficient;DFT;RT;Radon transform;content-based copy detection scheme;discrete Fourier transform;discrete cosine transform;feature vector extraction;image authentication","","0","","13","","","13-16 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the basis of deeply analysis on the principles of the AOI method, this paper points out some problems existing in it such as redundant attributes after generalization and the invalid rules. This paper puts forward the concept of correlation degree with target attribute, and then gives the improved algorithm according to it Removing the redundant attributes with weak correlation degree with target attribute could help the improved AOI overcome the problems existing in the classical AOI method, and thus improve its efficiency. Different approaches to calculate correlation degree with target attribute are defined to deal with different type of data. Grey relation and attribute reduction based on rough set method are induced to fulfill the above calculation. Experiments on an example demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4217-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4215-2; POD:978-1-4799-4214-5","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009689","Attribute correlation degree;Attribute-oriented induction;Data mining","Abstracts;Correlation;Databases;Semantics","data mining;relational databases;rough set theory","AOI;attribute correlation;attribute oriented induction;attribute oriented induction method;attribute reduction;data mining;grey relation;knowledge discovery methods;relational database query;rough set method;target attribute","","0","","10","","","13-16 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Latent semantic KNN algorithm for multi-label learning","Zi-Jie Chen; Zhi-Feng Hao","School of Computer Science and Engineering, SouthChinaUniversity of Technology, Guangzhou 510641, China","2014 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20150115","2014","1","","278","284","Exploiting label structures or label correlations is an important issue in multi-label learning, because taking into account such structures when learning can lead to improved predictive performance and time complexity. In this paper, a multi-label lazy learning approach based on k-nearest neighbor and latent semantics is presented, which is called LsKNN. Firstly, latent semantic analysis is applied to discover some semantic correlations between instances and class labels and the semantic features of each training sample are obtained. Then for each unseen instance, its k-nearest neighbors in the latent semantic subspace are identified and finally its proper label set is determined by resembling the votes of neighbors. Meanwhile, a support vector machine based pruning strategy called SVM-LsKNN, is proposed to deal with the slow testing of LsKNN. Experiments on three multi-label sets show that LsKNN needs no training, but can achieve at least comparable performance with some state-of-art multi-label learning algorithms. Extra experiments also verify the testing efficiency of the pruning technique.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4217-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4215-2; POD:978-1-4799-4214-5","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009129","K- nearest neighbors;Label correlations;Label structures;Latent semantic analysis;Multi-label learning;Support vector machine;pruning","Abstracts;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Measurement;Semantics;Support vector machines;Training","computational complexity;data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;support vector machines","SVM-LsKNN;k-nearest neighbor;label correlations;label structures;latent semantic KNN algorithm;latent semantic analysis;latent semantic subspace;multilabel lazy learning;multilabel learning algorithms;multilabel sets;predictive performance;pruning technique;semantic correlations;semantic features;support vector machine based pruning strategy;time complexity","","0","","22","","","13-16 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
