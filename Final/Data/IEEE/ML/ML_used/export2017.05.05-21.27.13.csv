In this model, all the features that are useful to predicate the POS tags are mined to make the model closer to the real case. In addition, for the problem of overfitting, a smoothing method and a POS dictionary are maintained to reduce the model's dependence to training data and improve the efficiency of the search process.

By analyzing the features of annotation of the contour and elevation point, the paper gives a method of identifying the elevation annotation of a scanned topographical map and discusses the principle of the method, including separating character series on the basis of morphological translating and splitting of the individual character based on the vertical projection.

They are both special cases of sparse features. A final classifier can be considered as a combination of a set of selected weak classifiers, and each weak classifier uses a sparse feature to classify samples. Motivated by this thought, we construct an over complete set of weak classifiers using linear support vector machine algorithm, and then select part of them using the AdaBoost algorithm and combine the selected weak classifiers to form a strong classifier. During the course of feature extraction and selection, our method can minimize the classification error directly, whereas most previous works cannot do this. The main difference from other methods is that the local features are learned from the training set instead of being arbitrarily defined. We applied our method to face detection.

In the paper, an adaptive cascade control strategy based on multiple models is presented. According to the different MW load, a set of linear models is developed and the controllers associated with each model are designed. By means of choosing an appropriate main/sub controller pair at the deferent MW load, the multi-pair controllers, which are robust, can satisfy the control performance specifications over the entire operating conditions of the plant. The main loop adopts IMC (internal model control) because of its straightforward handling of time-delay, and the sub loop adopts conventional P control.

Earlier work (2000) on discrete Hopfield neural networks showed that a parallel or serial mode of operation always leads to a limit cycle of period one or two for a skew or symmetric matrix, but they did not give an arbitrary weight matrix on how an updating operation might be needed to reach such a cycle. In this paper we present the existence conditions of limit cycles using matrix criteria in the HNNMDs network. For a network with an arbitrary weight matrix, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a limit cycle of period 1 and r are provided. The conditions for the existence of a special limit cycle of period 1 and 2 are also found. These results provide the foundation for many applications. A HNNMDs is said to have no stable state (fixed point) if it has a limit cycle of period 2 or more, which is stated in Theorem 5.

A conventional PID control strategy is not effective for its regulation, so it becomes a difficult problem in thermo-power automation. In view of the key problems in the automatic control of a ball mill system, the authors exploited an optimal expert fuzzy control system based on a net configuration-the Net-Fuzzy control system. The control system has the ability to solve the following technical problems satisfactorily. (1) It solves the measurement of coal load in the ball mill tube using a noise sensor as well as neural networks based soft-sensing, in which, a signal processing technique, multi-function approximation, a multi-media technique, and a fast Fourier transform (FFT) are used. This provides the basic guarantee for control strategy studies. (2) A steady state optimization strategy is presented based on a simple optimization method in order to boost the system's efficiency. (3) Net configuration software is developed for the system controlling database maintenance; system control and configuration are managed separately, so the more flexibility obtained, the easier it is to be mastered by control and operation engineers. Practicability and advanced quality have been verified by its application to many ball mill-pulverizing systems in several power plants.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175415","","Automatic control;Automation;Ball milling;Control systems;Couplings;Fuzzy control;MIMO;Optimization methods;Power generation;Three-term control","MIMO systems;coal;expert systems;fast Fourier transforms;function approximation;fuzzy control;fuzzy systems;intelligent control;optimal control;pulverised fuels;thermal power stations","MIMO plant;Net-Fuzzy control system;ball mill pulverizing system;coal load measurement;coal-fired power plant;configuration software;database maintenance;fast Fourier transform;multi-function approximation;multi-input multi-output plant;multi-media technique;neural networks based soft-sensing;noise sensor;nonlinear plant;optimal expert fuzzy control system;real time control;signal processing technique;steady state optimization strategy;thermo-power automation","","7","","9","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method can be seen as an extension of the traditional multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) method. which requires that the within-class scatter matrix is nonsingular. However, we may face many discriminant problems that do not satisfy this condition, such as the face recognition where the within-class matrix is often singular. To solve this problem, we extend the traditional MDA method and propose the EMDA method. The feature extraction strategy of the EMDA method is to maximize the trace of the between-class scatter matrix while constrains the trace of the within-class scatter matrix to be zero. However, to find the solution of the EMDA turns out to be a difficult task. In this paper, we find a way to overcome this problem. With the ORL face database, experiments show that the EMDA method reaches the lowest average class error rate compared to the eigenface method and the Fisherface method, which is only 49.9% of that the traditional eigenface and 79.4% of that the Fisherface method.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1176722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176722","","Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Error analysis;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Kernel;Pattern analysis;Pattern classification;Principal component analysis;Scattering","S-matrix theory;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;face recognition;feature extraction","Fisherfaces;Lagrange method;eigenface;eigenvectors;extended multiple discriminant analysis;face recognition;feature extraction;scatter matrix","","0","","9","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is the key of recognition to find out the valid features that reflect the nature of the well-log. In accordance with the characteristic that the well-log is steady in a short term, a method of recognition of log facies is proposed which is based upon the applying of Walsh transform. In this method,. we pretreated the log curve by using the Walsh inversion to improve its vertical resolution whose aim is to obtain the real log curve to reflect the actual status in the well. Because the gist of marking the log facies is that the tendency of the well-log curve reflects the depositional variety of the lithology, a method is proposed that the short-term sequence spectrum of well-log curve is regarded as the eigenfunction. An experiment indicates that the short-term sequence spectrum of well-log curve is distinct from each other in different log facies.

We establish a fundamental result in the theory of computation by an energy function method, and show that the discrete Hopfield neural network with delay is capable of generalizing computation for a kind of combinatorial optimization. The HNND evolution has been related to the descent to maximum value of an energy function. The new energy function proposed is related to the previous state (delay state) of the neural network, in which the energy function is able to escape from the local maximum value point by comparing different energy function values in order to obtain a global maximum value of the energy function. Furthermore, we also prove that the discrete asymmetric network with delay has a cycle of length 2 by the energy function method. It is shown that the diagonal elements of the connection matrix have an important influence on the convergence process, and they represent the relationship of the local maximum value of the energy function with the updating mode of the networks.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175438","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175438","","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Convergence;Delay;Electronic mail;Equations;Hopfield neural networks;Neural networks;Neurons;Optimization methods","Hopfield neural nets;convergence;delays;matrix algebra","computational model;connection matrix;convergence;delay;discrete Hopfield neural network;energy function;local maximum value point","","0","","17","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the information system is generalized by considering a family of subsystems. An information system with more than one subsystem is called a distributed information system. A new concept called meta-information is presented to describe an information system or its subsystems. Algorithms for meta-information integration and derived meta-information generation are proposed. Many existing methods can be reimplemented on the basis of meta-information to avoid the costly work of data integration. Operations on meta-information are very simple and cost-effective.

Mainly, it can be performed by visual or aural methods. We know that it is possible to recognize people's emotion by only sound data. We use the pitch of speech as a main feature. We define features of four emotions (normal, angry, laugh, surprise) in pitch analysis. Based on this feature pattern, we implement a simulator using VC++. First of all, this simulator is composed of 'generation of individuals', 'recurrent neural net (RNN)', and 'evaluation'. Using the result from the learning part of this simulator, we can get results applied to other speech data (excepting for learning data). In detail, each module uses the following method. First, the generation of individuals part uses (1+100)-ES and (1+1)-ES (that is, random). Thus, we observe the comparison result of both methods. Then, we select the best way. Second, the RNN part is composed of 7-nodes. That is, 1 input node, 2 hidden layer nodes, 4 output nodes. Selection of this structure depends on the characteristics of sequentially inputted speech data. Third, the evaluation part is very important. This part is the cause of the extraction speed and satisfaction degree of result. Then we implement a simulator from the above modules. Applied to other speech data, we observe the result of recognition.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175432","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175432","","Data mining;Emotion recognition;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Positron emission tomography;Recurrent neural networks;Robot sensing systems;Speech analysis;Speech recognition;Telephony","emotion recognition;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","angry;center-clipping;emotion recognition;evaluation;feature pattern;generation of individuals;laugh;learning;normal;pitch analysis;recurrent neural network;sound data;speech;surprise","","2","","5","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
