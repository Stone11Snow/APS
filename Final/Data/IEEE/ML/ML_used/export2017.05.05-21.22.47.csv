One approach is to have the network represent a trading strategy. That is, rather than basing a trading decision on a predicted value or movement in the price of some asset, the network directly outputs a decision buy or sell. Thus, the network does not represent a continuous-valued function of its inputs, but rather, a discrete classifier. While the performance of such a network will depend on factors such as the structure of the network and the selection of input features, other factors also play an important role. In this paper we investigate the effects that training window size and prediction window size have in determining the ability of the network to successfully time the placement of trades. Results of experiments performed on the Dow Jones industrial average suggest that although some configurations of training and prediction windows sizes do yield satisfactory performance over an extended prediction period, improved performance might be achieved by dynamically adjusting window sizes on the basis of recent trends displayed by the time series.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259858","","Australia;Decision making;Economic forecasting;Economic indicators;Genetic algorithms;Industrial training;Information analysis;Information technology;Neural networks;Predictive models","commerce;finance;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","Dow Jones industrial average;discrete classifier;financial trading;network structure;neural financial prediction models;prediction window sizes;trading strategy;training window size","","0","","15","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The pixels number of the rectangle area is large and the intensity values of these pixels are often treated as a feature vector. It is very important to drop the dimension of the vector for an effective recognition. Three means for dimensional reduction in the feature extraction field are often used, including average values of weighted intensity, wavelet transform and principle component analysis. The compact face feature vector is the eigenvector to be recognized. A face recognition method using ART2 is proposed in the paper.

Based on a control Lyapunov function approach, we derive a sufficient condition to ensure the stability of the closed loop fuzzy system. Moreover, the proposed condition leads to control Lyapunov function nonlinear standpoints that can find a desired controller directly and avoid solving simultaneous matrix inequality, which usually must be solved through numerical methods.

To support the demanding management task the multi-agent approach offers promising perspectives. Intermodal freight transportation (IFT) is a complex task involving a lot of information flowing across organizational boundaries. However, the interorganizational information flows are often slow, and sometimes even are blocked, due to lack of standardized data storage format, no rules for arranging automated transfer from one system to another, and so on. This paper presents a multi-agent system (MAS) approach to the design and organization of an integrated IFT information architecture. We propose to organize the IFT system as an open network of autonomous agents, each encapsulating one or more logistics roles, and each coordinating its activities with other agents. The architecture is first described using an abstract specification based on concepts such as agents, roles and role protocols, and then specified in details using an example. A major conclusion is that the MAS based architecture can support IFT parties to integrate their information systems in an effort to truly reach a seamless intermodal transport.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259885","","Autonomous agents;Information management;Information systems;Logistics;Memory;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Technology management;Traffic control;Transportation","freight handling;goods dispatch data processing;information systems;logistics;multi-agent systems;transportation","MAS;abstract specification;agent-based design;intermodal freight transportation system;interorganizational information;multiagent system;open network","","0","","6","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As rule-base IDS can gain good detecting performance, we build a genetic immune model, which is adaptive to rule-based IDS, to improve the IDS's detecting performance of new attacks. As one successful method, state transition (ST) analysis models penetrations as a series of state changes that lead from initial state to a target compromised state. Using this model of recomposing the ST method to solve the low recognizing ratio problem is presented in this paper. In this model, ST method can be expressed in a double DNA chains pattern. One chain is the system state chain; the other is an action chain. The double twisting chains form a state-action sequence to represent the system state transitions. In order to still gain the recognizing performance of the regular ID systems, we use STAT rules to create the initial non-self (or expert) DNA library, and newly found attacking-rules can still be added to the library.

In this paper, a modification algorithm, which applied linguistic variable concept tree to describe the slope feather of time series, was presented named dynamic time warping. For reducing the computational time and local shape variance disturbing, the piecewise linear representation was used to process warping path. Moreover, the linguist concept tree was developed based on cloud models theory which integrities randomness and probability of uncertainty, so that made conversion between qualitative and quantitative knowledge. Experiments about cluster analysis on the basis of this algorithm, compared with Euclidean measure, were implemented on synthetic control chart time series. The results showed that this method, presented in this paper, have strong robustness to loss of feather data due to piecewise segment preprocessing.

The growing and pruning training algorithms of a neural tree are proposed to train four pattern categories samples, corresponding to digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and the mixture of digits and letters, respectively. After building the tree, there exists a number of leaf nodes that contain more than one character class, they must be further broken down into individual clusters since a definite recognition is demanded for a given input pattern.

However, Fourier analysis provided a poor representation of signals well localized in time. In this case, it is difficult to detect and identify the signal pattern from the expansion coefficients because the information is diluted across the global basis. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) is introduced as an alternative means of extracting time-frequency information from vibration signature. The resulting WPT coefficients provide one with arbitrary time-frequency resolution of a signal. With the aid of statistical-based feature selection criteria, many of the feature components containing little discriminant information could be discarded. The extracted reduced dimensional feature vector is then used for fault diagnosis. In this paper, we put forward a new method based on WPT for vibration monitoring and fault diagnosis of turbo-generator. The method is mainly based on WPT power spectrum density (PSD) analysis. Extensive experiments on rotor laboratorial platform show that the implementation meets the requirement of vibration signals analysis. It is feasible and effective.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264446","","Condition monitoring;Data mining;Fault diagnosis;Feature extraction;Frequency domain analysis;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Time domain analysis;Time frequency analysis;Wavelet packets","Fourier analysis;fault diagnosis;feature extraction;monitoring;statistics;turbogenerators;vibrations;wavelet transforms","Fourier-based analysis;condition monitoring;fault diagnosis;power spectrum density analysis;statistical-based feature selection criteria;time-frequency information;turbogenerator systems;vibration monitoring;vibration signatures;wavelet packet feature extraction;wavelet packet transform","","2","","13","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The inside-outside (IO) algorithm is the most popular estimator for learning the probability parameters associated to the rules from training sequences. The inside-outside algorithm needs O(L<sup>3</sup>M<sup>3</sup>) (L is the length of training sequence and M is the number of non-terminals) operations. The IO algorithm considers a number of useless inside variables (α-variables) and useless outside variables (β-variables) in each training iteration. In this paper we give a method to avoid these useless variables. Our method uses a prediction function for this purpose. We give an example based on RNA sequences (taken from [Y.

A common method for segmentation of moving regions in image sequences involves ""background subtraction"", namely, thresholding the error between an estimate of the image without moving objects and the current image. The numerous approaches to this problem differ in the type of background model used and the procedure used to update the model. One possible approach to this problem is to model the attributes of the pixels. In order to segment a larger image in reasonable time and obtain better results, an algorithm of segmenting background based on temporal spatial information of pixels is proposed in this paper. Firstly, adaptive pixel models are modeled to describe the recent history of color at each observed pixel. Then each pixel is classified as background or foreground according to pixel models and the spatial relation between pixels. Finally, parameters of pixel models are updated using on-line EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our approach is suitable for segmenting foreground from background in dynamic environments.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1260119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260119","","Educational institutions;Food technology;Image segmentation;Image sequences;Iterative algorithms;Layout;Pixel;Predictive models;Robustness;Shape","image segmentation;image sequences;spatiotemporal phenomena","Gaussian distribution;adaptive pixel models;background subtraction;dynamic scenes;homogeneous regions;image segmentation;image sequences;moving region segmentation;online EM algorithm;temporal spatial information;thresholding","","0","3","12","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the multifocus images, there are some areas unclear in certain source images which correspond to small wavelet coefficients, and clear in other source images which correspond to large coefficients. So we simply took the coefficients with greater modulus as the final coefficients to get the fusion image, which contains more details and is clearer in visual and more convenient for image analysis and understanding. We also discussed the influence of the wavelet filters, decomposition levels and fusion schemes on the fusion results, compared wavelet based fusion with other multiresolution fusions, such as Laplacian pyramid, gradient pyramid, contrast pyramid and ratio pyramid.

At last, audio-visual features and text information are integrated to realize automatic story segmentation. On test data with 135, 400 frames, the accuracy rate 85.8% and the recall rate 97.5% are obtained.

The digital image watermarking techniques are usually performed in spatial or transform domain. Most of transform-domain watermarking methods are based on Discrete Cosine Transforms (DCT) and robust to JPEG lossy compression. Recently, digital image watermarking based on another significant lossy compression technique, Vector Quantization (VQ), has appeared, which carries watermark information by codeword indices. It is quite effective, especially for the robustness to VQ compression with the same codebook. We develop a more favorable image watermarking method based on classified VQ in this paper. This technique can achieve excellent embedding performance and extract the watermark without the original image. This original theoretical result is acceptable with experiments that show superiority to some existing VQ-based watermarking algorithms, and the watermarked image is robust to some common signal processing operations.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1260056","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260056","","Copyright protection;Digital images;Discrete cosine transforms;Discrete transforms;Image coding;Robustness;Signal processing algorithms;Transform coding;Vector quantization;Watermarking","discrete cosine transforms;image classification;pattern clustering;vector quantisation;watermarking","DCT;JPEG lossy compression;VQ compression;classified labeled bisecting k-means clustering;codeword indices;digital image watermarking methods;discrete cosine transforms;multimedia copyright protection;robustness;signal processing operations;spatial domain watermarking;transform domain watermarking;vector quantization","","1","","9","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we proposed a modified line segment hausdorff distance measure for face recognition.

Most existing approaches to this problem are based on density estimation and hence suffer from the usual problems associated with estimating probability densities in high dimensional spaces. This paper describes how feedforward neural networks can be used to learn a classifier from a dataset consisting of (labeled) examples of the target class (positive examples) together with a corpus of unlabeled (positive and negative) examples. An application of the technique to the prediction of mineral deposit location is provided, and empirical results are presented.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259857","","Australia;Electronic mail;Feedforward neural networks;Information technology;Input variables;Labeling;Minerals;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Probability density function","feedforward neural nets;learning by example;minerals;mining industry;pattern classification","feedforward neural networks;mineral deposit prediction;single-class classifier learning;target class","","2","","14","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using the proposed method, the parameters of a fuzzy controller can be tuned online, and the control performance can be improved. In addition, CMAC is used only for tuning grain parameters, so that it is easy to implement and other fuzzy parameters can be designed by conventional method. The paper has already proposed a fuzzy controller with nonlinear scaling functions and controller designing method based on the relationship between the parameters of fuzzy controller and system performance. The proposed method is an extended version of the previously proposed method mentioned above to the fuzzy controller with nonlinear scaling factors, a tuning method of parameters using CMAC. The proposed control scheme is numerically evaluated on some simulations.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259939","","Adaptive control;Chaos;Control systems;Design methodology;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Nonlinear control systems;Programmable control;System performance;Tuning","adaptive control;cerebellar model arithmetic computers;control system synthesis;fuzzy control;fuzzy systems;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;self-adjusting systems","CMAC self-tuning scheme;adaptive control;cerebellar model arithmetic computers;fuzzy controller parameters;fuzzy system design;grain parameters tuning;nonlinear controller designing method;nonlinear scaling functions","","0","","9","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We proposed a new procedure to classify human tumor samples based on microarray gene expressions by using a hybrid supervised learning method called MOEA/WV (multi-objective evolutionary algorithm/weighted voting). MOEA is used to search for a relatively few subsets of informative genes from the high-dimensional gene space, and WV is used as a classification tool. This new method has been applied to predicate the subtypes of Iymphoma and outcomes of medulloblastoma. The results are relatively accurate and meaningful compared with those from other methods.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259886","","Computer science;DNA;Evolutionary computation;Frequency;Gene expression;Humans;Learning systems;Neoplasms;Pareto optimization;Supervised learning","evolutionary computation;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;pattern classification;tumours","gene microarray data;gene space;hybrid supervised learning method;informative genes;lymphoma;medullosblastoma;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;tumor classification;weighted voting","","2","","12","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, there is no easy way to model such kind of systems. This paper presents a Pattern Recognition based Adaptive Real-time Scheduling (PRARS) framework for adaptive real-time systems. The usage of Pattern Recognition Theory provides a scientific underpinning on PID control. Through processing feature information, establishing character mode collection, pattern recognizing, and building control rule collection, we implement the PRARS. This enables us to fulfill more precise and efficient QoS and admission control, and guarantees the dynamical requirements of resources. Thus complex modeling methods could be avoided. The algorithm ensures robust performance of real-time tasks.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1260123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260123","","Adaptive control;Adaptive scheduling;Control nonlinearities;Control systems;Pattern recognition;Processor scheduling;Programmable control;Real time systems;Three-term control;Uncertainty","adaptive control;adaptive systems;control system synthesis;pattern recognition;real-time systems;three-term control","PID control;PRARS;QoS;adaptive real time systems;admission control;autonomous real time system;character mode collection;control rule collection;pattern recognition based adaptive real time scheduling;pattern recognition theory;proportional-integral-differential control;quality of service;unmanned real time system","","0","","14","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
