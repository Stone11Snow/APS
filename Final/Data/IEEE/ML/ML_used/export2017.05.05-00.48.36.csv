So exactly to recognize real customer in e-supply chain is the key factor to success for assuring the profit of the whole e-supply chain. There is a large amount of consuming data stored in the e-supply chain everyday. If one e-supply chain can make full use of these valuable data on the Internet to recognize its real customers and target these customers' features of consuming behaviors to produce, sell, distribute, and offer a integrated individualized service from the whole e-supply chain, this greatly increases the loyalty of customers of the e-supply chain, maximize the profit of the whole e-supply chain, and make the e-supply chain more competitive in the world. In this paper, SOFM neural network is employed as a tool to mine these valuable consuming data in the e-supply chain for recognizing its real customers. The SOFM neural network is a novel and very interesting approach that can resemble recognition function of the brain. By mean of the SOFM neural network's approach, these most-downstream customers in e-supply chain can be objectively, scientifically and automatically clustered and divided into different groups.

The local feature of inputting strokes is firstly coded according to the eight equiangular encircled directions. Inputting digit is then modeled with a set of rules defined with the code of local features to characterize the drawing style of inputting digit. The decision tree learning is also invoked to model the variance of drawing styles and guarantees high recognition rate. Main advantage of proposed method is twofold. Firstly, it is quite simple and highly discriminating, and can do recognition quickly under strict resource constraints. Secondly, it is insensitive to different users and guarantees user adaptability.

Based on a proxy-based architecture, a hierarchical scheduling model is proposed to efficiently utilize the energy of wireless nodes with respect to quality of service (QoS). The first level scheduler is responsible for mapping tasks among proxy-nodes and other fixed grid nodes; the second will conduct scheduling in each proxy-centric wireless domain. Under the guidance of four principles suitable for the intermittence, the first level performs overall scheduling based on the FIFS algorithm (first input first service). After modeling a consumed power objective function, a revised min-min heuristic algorithm is enforced to the second level in order to efficiently map tasks to wireless devices. In the latter algorithm, mobile node selection is targeted to minimize the energy consumed due to communication and computation, and its last solution is evaluated to guarantee requirement for the task deadline. This research simulation suggests that the power-aware hierarchical scheduling improves energy utilization of the overall system, and also decreases the ratio of failure of scheduled tasks in wireless grids","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:1-4244-0061-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028152","Hierarchical scheduling;Power management;Resource intermittence;Wireless grid","Batteries;Computer architecture;Cybernetics;Educational technology;Energy management;Grid computing;Machine learning;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Processor scheduling;Quality of service;Resource management;Scheduling algorithm","grid computing;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);quality of service;resource allocation;scheduling","QoS;energy utilization;first input first service algorithm;min-min heuristic algorithm;mobile node selection;mobility management;power management;power objective function consumption;power-aware hierarchical scheduling model;proxy-based architecture;quality of service;resource allocation;resource intermittence;task scheduling;wireless device;wireless grid","","13","","19","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposed an airborne automatic data reduction scheme to solve the aforementioned problem. The key steps of this scheme are automatic image matching and clipping. The algorithm utilizes the strong logic relativities among adjacent aero-photographs and it is based on the model of 2D affine transformation. When detecting no highlighted moving targets, the algorithm performs automatic clipping for overlapping part of two adjacent images by using of Fourier-Mellin transform.

First, a piecewise discrete Lyapunov function is constructed in all maximal overlapped-rule groups. Each discrete Lyapunov function lies in its own maximal overlapped-rule group. Then, a new sufficient condition to check the stability of discrete T-S fuzzy systems is proposed. This condition only requires finding a common positive definite matrix in each maximal overlapped-rule group. Compared with former stability analysis approaches, this approach can not only overcome the defect of finding a common positive definite matrix but also reduce the number of solving Lyapunov inequalities largely.

In this paper, the Sugeno integral is introduced to address the problems faced in liaison evaluation. It models the casualness of the spontaneous speech sound and the unstableness of the speech processing system via fuzzy measures and reliabilities respectively, and then fusing them under the Sugeno integral framework to output the linguistic rather than quantitive score. The experiment shows that, under the 58% average recognition rate of the system, our liaison evaluation model get very reliable and stable results for both closing and opening test, which encourage us to apply this model to other tasks of the spoken language evaluation in the future","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:1-4244-0061-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258914","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028505","Liaison;Sphinx-4;Spoken language evaluation;Sugeno Integral","Art;Automatic speech recognition;Cybernetics;Feedback;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Natural languages;Reliability;Rhythm;Speech processing;Speech recognition;System testing;Testing;Timing","computer aided instruction;integration;natural languages;speech processing;statistical analysis","Sugeno integration;computer aided spoken language learning;fuzzy measure;liaison evaluation;speech processing system;spoken English;spoken language evaluation;statistical analysis","","0","","11","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
