This has traditionally been accomplished using sonar or infra-red sensors to measure the robot's proximity to nearby objects. The most recent of efforts rely on sophisticated sensors, such as LIDAR and stereo vision, and result in solutions which are both expensive economically and computationally. Furthermore, these approaches often provide an overflow of data requiring a great deal of processing. This paper discusses an alternative method using a single camera sampling images periodically to calculate the flow within an image and provide sufficient information to allow a small autonomous robot to navigate a corridor and react to obstacles. This method was implemented on a small robotic platform within an RT-Linux environment.

We applied such methods to a data set of vegetation indices and land cover type assembled from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data collection. The experimental comparison suggested that straight-forward Interpolation, although a commonly used technique for filling in missing values, may not always yield the best results.

Multi-resolution analysis, which is applied to fMRI, is a new dealing method. In statistical analysis, many statistical algorithms identify whether each pixel is activated by counting the serial time of them dependently, or by taking the spatial relativity of pixels into account. Factorial kriging based on multi-resolution analysis count the spatial relativity of pixels by the serial time of each one. The spatial relativity can be approximated using the orthogonal least square method and standard different scale variation structure models. It counts the spatial relativity among pixels and factorialy analyze the spatial relativity of different scales in order to get the contribution to the main factors of slice pixels in different scales and indicate the activated areas of brain by the given threshold. In the paper, the cross-variograms, cross-covariance, standard variogram structure function and cooperating regional matrixes are studied and the regional factors estimation and identifying parts of brain activated by factorial kriging are carried out.

We prove that in such formulation the solution in pure minimax strategies is equivalent to the solution given by standard fuzzy pairwise SVM method.

Hence, the expensive 2D block matching need only be performed in a limited scope, which saves a lot of time. Moreover, an efficient implementation to calculate 1D vector is presented to speed up encoder further.

In this technique, the behavior of the user is recorded over a period of time and analyzed to generate the mobility models (profiles) of the users. The generated mobility models are used to predict the future movement of the users in order to perform the call admission and the resource reservation. A local mobility model can be generated for the individual user and a global mobility model can be generated for a group of users. We used the combination between the local and the global mobility models to compare the performance of this technique with other techniques. In this paper, we focus on studying the performance of PCAC-RR technique comparing three types of mobility models: 1) the local mobility model only, 2) the global mobility model only, and 3) the combination between local and global mobility models. Also, in this paper we explain the simulation environment in details and how to study the performance of the presented technique using each of these mobility models. Simulation results show that using the hierarchical structure of local and global mobility models improves the performance significantly.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383498","inductive learning;mobile computing;mobile data mining;mobility profiles;resource management;wireless networks","Bandwidth;Call admission control;Computational modeling;Data mining;Intelligent networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Predictive models;Quality of service;Resource management","","","","1","","16","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HKCONSIM is suitable for assisting a RMC plant in its resource provision planning and concrete production scheduling in order to meet given demands at a number of sites for concrete over a working day, determine the least costly, most productive amount of truckmixer resources to improve the supply service level and the utilization level of the truckmixer resources available. To simulate and optimize the RMC production operations with HKCONSIM does not require familiarity by the user with any software-specific terminology and modeling schematics; simulation model construction can be easily achieved by specifying the attributes for each pour and site and providing the plant and truck-mixer resources available on self-explanatory on-screen forms.

Instead of using predefined k nearest neighbors, the number of men and women in the first two quartiles in Euclidean space are used for voting. GP is, then, used to evolve an optimal class mapping function that effectively reduces the outliers. The performance of modified nearest neighborhood (ModNN) classifier is then compared with the conventional kNN for gender classification problem. Receiver Operating Characteristics curve and its Area Under the Convex Hull (A UCH) are used as the performance measures.

Frame theory provides a well founded mathematical framework for representing data in many different ways. We analyze the effects of sparse and dense data representations on the generalization error of such learning machines measured by using leave-one-out error given a finite number of training data. We show that, in the case of sparse data representation, the generalization capacity of an SVM trained by using polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions is equal to the one of a linear SVM. This is equivalent to saying that the capacity of separating points of functions belonging to hypothesis spaces induced by polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions reduces to the capacity of a separating hyperplane in the input space. We show that sparse data representations reduce the generalization error as long as the representation is not too sparse, as in the case of very large dictionaries. Dense data representations, on the contrary, reduce the generalization error also in the case of very large dictionaries. We use two different schemes for representing data in overcomplete Haar and Gabor dictionaries, and measure SVM generalization error on bench mark data set. Moreover we study sparse and dense data representations with frame of data and we show how this leads to Principal Component Analysis.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383504","","Automation;Dictionaries;Intelligent systems;Kernel;Learning systems;Machine learning;Polynomials;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","","","","0","","10","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these works aim at protecting secure information from leakage by enforcing security constraints. For security reasons, the knowledge available at high security level is not disclosed to subjects holding lower security clearance levels. The inherent inability of multilevel secure systems to utilize the high security knowledge for inference may lead to poor Quality of Inference at low security levels. The paper explores the issue of improving Quality of Inference without significantly compromising security. We first develop a secure Match-Resolve-Act algorithm. We then illustrate the Quality of Inference issues arising in a secure knowledge based system, and suggest an inter-level inference engine based architecture for improving the Quality of Inference.

We have studied several possibilities including all energy methods that are utilized in the standard image fusion for digital camera application and discuss the difference to our new method. The new framework uses two trained HMMs to decide if the wavelet coefficients of source images are in-focus or out-focus, and then judges the quality of pixels in the source images directly to overcome the shift-variant of inverse wavelet transform. The two trained HMMs are obtained separately from an in-focus image and a out-focus image using EM algorithm.

Roller bearing run-to-failure tests are conducted to generate full life cycle degradation data, by which the proposed method is validated. The results demonstrate that SOM-based performance assessment and degradation detection approach provides a means of enhancing the condition monitoring of the roller bearing.

By utilizing PolyCluster, users can obtain the visual representation for underlying datasets, and utilize that information to draw polygons to encompass wellformed clusters.

Experimental evaluation shows that PolyCluster is a visual-based approach that offers numerous improvements over previous visual-based techniques.

"Mining frequent closed itemsets for large data","Huaiguo Fu; E. Mephu Nguifo","","2004 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, 2004. Proceedings.","20050131","2004","","","328","335","Mining frequent closed itemsets is one effective method to analyse frequent pattern, and further, to generate association rules. Several algorithms were proposed to generate frequent closed itemsets, including CLOSE, A-CLOSE, CLOSET, CHARM and CLOSET + etc. However it's still hard for these algorithms to deal with dense and very large data. In this paper, we analyze the search space of frequent closed itemsets and propose a new decomposition algorithm for mining frequent closed itemsets called PFC. PFC can dynamically generate non-overlapping partitions of the search space and mine frequent closed itemsets in each partition. Furthermore, each partition is independent and only shares the same source data with other partitions. So it is possible to implement PFC with multi-threads or parallel methods, and prune efficiently the search space of frequent closed itemsets. In this study, P FC is implemented in Java. We compare PFC with an author's C++ version of CLOSET + on some large VCI repository datasets and on the worst case. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate good performance of PFC for dealing with dense and very large data.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383531","","Association rules;Data analysis;Data mining;Databases;Itemsets;Java;Lattices;Lenses;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern analysis","","","","0","","13","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically, such classification has been performed using signals from a set of selected EEG sensors. Since EEG sensor signals are mixtures of signals from multiple intra- and extra-cranial sources, single-trial sensory and motor evoked potentials can be difficult to detect and classify. In this paper, second-order blind identification (SOBI) was used to preprocess EEG data and extract activity from the left and right primary somatosensory (SI) cortices. Subsequently, classification of event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by a sequence of randomly mixed left, right, and bilateral median nerve stimulations was performed by back-propagation neural networks, using as inputs the two SOBI-recovered SI components or the two ""best sensors"". Results from four subjects showed that classification accuracy was significantly higher when SOBI-recovered left and right SI components were used for classification than when the EEG sensor signals were used directly.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384584","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384584","","Biological neural networks;Brain computer interfaces;Electroencephalography;Enterprise resource planning;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Psychology;Signal to noise ratio;Source separation;Transient analysis","backpropagation;bioelectric potentials;biosensors;blind source separation;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;neural nets;signal classification;somatosensory phenomena;user interfaces","EEG sensor signals;backpropagation neural networks;bilateral median nerve stimulations;brain computer interfaces;event related potentials;extracranial sources;intracranial sources;motor evoked potential detection;primary somatosensory cortices;second order blind identification;sensory evoked potential detection;single trial classification","","2","","24","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a structural content abstraction scheme within the Bayesian framework, based on which an implicit and reliable image authentication scheme can be established. Since BSCA provides a trustworthy reference which correlates highly with the content, the proposed authentication method possesses both robustness to non-content operations (NCO) and sensitivity to content operations (CO).

In simulations, the use of multiple covariance matrices computed with different time delays, τs, was beneficial for source separation, particularly when the underlying sources had highly overlapping spectra. Given the spectral overlap between actual brain sources, we experimented with different sets of temporal delays to empirically determine their effects on the isolation of electrical signals arising from a temporally and spatially well characterized brain location, the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Using EEG data collected during median nerve stimulation, we found that the successful isolation of left and right SI activity required the use of a range of time delays and that the best separation was observed when the largest range of τs from 1 up to 300 ms was used.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384580","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384580","","Blind source separation;Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Covariance matrix;Data processing;Delay effects;Electroencephalography;Signal processing;Source separation;Statistics","blind source separation;covariance matrices;delays;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;somatosensory phenomena;statistics","1 to 300 ms;EEG data;blind source separation algorithm;brain location;brain sources;data processing technique;electrical signal isolation;joint diagonalization;median nerve stimulation;multiple covariance matrices;primary somatosensory cortex;second order blind identification;second order statistics;spectral overlap;statistical processing technique;temporal delays;time delays","","1","","19","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To validate these claims, a classification algorithm is defined under this feature space. We use a subset in KDD Cup 1999 data in the experiments. The KDD Cup 1999 training dataset contains 6 different types of DDoS attacks and the testing dataset contains more 4 novel DDoS attacks.

LASSO can be used to build a wide variety of applications or can be used as a collaborative experimentation workbench.

"Reducing complexity of rule based models via meta mining","L. A. Kurgan","","2004 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, 2004. Proceedings.","20050131","2004","","","242","249","Complexity, or in other words compactness, of models generated by rule learners is one of often neglected issues, although it has a profound effect on the success of any project that utilizes the rules. Researchers strive to propose learners that are characterized by excellent accuracy, and sometimes also low computational complexity, but the size of the data model generated by the learners is often not even reported. While the model size can be disregarded from the research point of view, it is very important from the end user's perspective. Quite often the generated model is too complex to be manually analyzed or inspected, which prohibits from using it in a real-world setting. To jill this gap, the paper proposes a novel framework, which is designed to address problem of complexity reduction of rule based models. The framework is based on a Meta Mining concept, and can be applied to enhance several of existing rule learners. Its main goal is to reduce complexity, in terms of reducing size and number of generated rules, without sacrificing accuracy of the rules. The paper proposes the framework, and tests it on a set of benchmark datasets using two well known rule learners: C5.0 and DataSqueezer. The results are encouraging, and show that 50% complexity reduction can be achieved virtually without any loss of accuracy.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383520","","Benchmark testing;Character generation;Computational complexity;Data mining;Data models;Decision trees;Induction generators;Logic;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms","","","","2","","44","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, recent studies with highly noisy patterns clearly showed that overfitting can occur. A natural strategy to alleviate the problem is to penalize the distribution skewness in the learning process to prevent several hardest examples from spoiling decision boundaries. In this paper, we describe in detail how a penalty scheme can be pursued in the mathematical programming setting as well as in the Boosting setting. By using two smooth convex penalty functions, two new soft margin concepts are defined and two new regularized AdaBoost algorithms are proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through a large scale experiment.

However, most of the improvements of wavelet domain HMMs only focus on how to impose an additional dependency structure on the original wavelet domain HMMs to capture the additional dependencies among wavelet coefficients. Besides this, existing methods do not fully consider the effects of noise in high frequency subbands of wavelet transforms. Some simple algorithms of wavelet domain HMMs, such as dividing the subband of wavelet coefficients into blocks, cannot be carried on smoothly in a noisy image. We give a more general framework to simplify wavelet domain HMM using templates. The new model enables us to concisely share the statistics in real-world noisy image using a more reasonable way and enables us to get a simple, local and reliable model using templates. Templates are constructed in the subband of scaling coefficients in order to reduce the effects of image noises and provide powerful yet tractable probabilistic image models. Before we process images using wavelet domain HMMs, the estimation of parameters for the HMMs must be obtained by the EM training algorithm that shares statistics according to the templates. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of new models, we give an example for image denoising using templates and wavelet-domain HMMs.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384593","","Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Image processing;Noise reduction;Parameter estimation;Signal processing;Statistics;Wavelet coefficients;Wavelet domain;Wavelet transforms","hidden Markov models;image denoising;probability;statistical analysis;wavelet transforms","EM training algorithm;image denoising;noisy image;parameter estimation;probabilistic image models;statistical image processing;statistical signal processing;template model;wavelet coefficients;wavelet domain HMM;wavelet domain hidden Markov models;wavelet transforms","","0","","9","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inverse IVBV problems are prominent in science and engineering problems governed by partial differential equations where often an effect is measured and the cause is not known. In these situations scientists and engineers typically observe the response of a system and desire to know the particulars of the system that elicited such a response. In this paper, an artificial immune system (AIS) is used to monitor a physical system, to identify the need for solving an inverse IVBV problem within that system, and to solve said problem. Specifically, an AIS is used to determine the heat conducting properties of a material that elicits a measured temperature distribution response when subjected to time-varying boundary temperatures. Results indicate that the AIS provides an effective mechanism for solving this particular inverse IVBV problem.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383500","","Artificial immune systems;Boundary conditions;Inverse problems;Monitoring;Partial differential equations;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Robustness;Temperature distribution;Temperature measurement","","","","0","","5","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The additional frequency components arising from noise produces an adverse effect on the subjective study of the spectrogram and its quantitative analysis. A novel approach using the adapted local cosine transform, combined with the non-negative garrote thresholding method, is proposed to remove noise from the quadrature Doppler ultrasound signal. At first, the directional information is extracted from the quadrature signal. Then the denoising method based on the adapted local cosine transform is performed on the forward and reverse flow signals, respectively. At last, the estimated signal is reconstructed from the denoised signals using Hilbert transform. In the simulation study, the estimation precision of the mean frequency waveform and the spectral width waveform are studied for the signal after denoising.

We extend the Data Augmentation (DA) technique for multiple imputation to Gaussian mixture models to permit fully Bayesian inference of model parameters and estimation of the missing values. The method is compared to imputation using a single normal density on synthetic and real-world data. In addition to a lower mean squared error than can be achieved by simple imputation methods, mixture models provide valuable information on the potentially multi-modal nature of imputed values.

Because of the relatively poor signal to noise ratio, evoked responses potentials (ERPs) were typically measured by averaging over multiple trials. While recent applications of blind source separation (BSS) and independent component analysis (ICA) improved the effective signal to noise ratio (S/N) by separating different brain sources and other extra-cranial sources, variations in the background on-going activity of each brain sources makes it difficult to determine whether and when an evoked response potential has occurred. We introduced and combined several new approaches to improve single-trial ERP detection from a previously reported MEG data set with relatively low S/N. First, new metrics based on multiresolution filtering were introduced to better discriminate a ERP against background oscillatory activity. Second, a novel interactive user interface was implemented to use the new metrics to detect single-trial ERPs from an example. Third, time series of brain source activation recovered using BSS were used as inputs to this multiresolution method. We report sharpened average ERPs after alignment using the detected single-trial ERP onset time and a reduction in false detection from the previously reported 26+/-2% to 13+/-2%.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384583","","Blind source separation;Electroencephalography;Enterprise resource planning;Filtering;Independent component analysis;Magnetoencephalography;Noise measurement;Signal resolution;Signal to noise ratio;Source separation","bioelectric potentials;blind source separation;electroencephalography;filtering theory;independent component analysis;magnetoencephalography;medical computing;medical signal detection;time series;user interfaces","EEG;ICA;MEG data set;S-N ratio;blind source separation;brain source activation;brain source separation;cranial sources;electroencephalography;evoked response potential detection;independent component analysis;interactive user interface;magnetoencephalography;multiresolution filtering;multiresolution metrics;oscillatory activity;sensory stimulation;signal to noise ratio;single trial evoked response potentials;time series","","0","","14","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve the morphable model for 3D face synthesis, several measures are taken in this work. Firstly, the mesh resampling method is used to overcome the key problem of model construction, the pixel-to-pixel alignments of prototypic faces. Secondly, based on the mesh resampling data we construct a multi-resolution model to accelerate the model matching procedure and improve the stability of matching convergence.

In the context of webbased educational sy stems, contrast rules help to identifY attributes characterizing patterns of performance disparity between various groups of students.

Since the Apriori algorithm was proposed in 1994, there have been several methods proposed to improve its performance. However, most still adopt its candidate set generationand- test approach. In addition, many methods do not generate all frequent patterns, making them inadequate to derive association rules. The Pattern Decomposition (PD) algorithm that can significantly reduce the size of the dataset on each pass makes it more efficient to mine all frequent patterns in a large dataset. This algorithm avoids the costly process of candidate set generation and saves a great amount of counting time to evaluate support with reduced datasets. In this paper, some existing frequent pattern generation algorithms are explored, their comparisons are discussed, which shows that the PD algorithm outperforms an improved version of Apriori named Direct Count of candidates & Prune transactions (DCP) by one order of magnitude and is faster than an improved FP-tree (Frequent Pattern) named as Predictive Item Pruning (PIP).

The best classification result attained suggests that the technique we employ is particularly suitable for digital ink manipulation at the level of words.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383487","","Classification algorithms;Computer science;Data mining;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Ink;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Rivers;Sun","","","","0","","9","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The selection of the support vectors is effected by a small change of the training data. To obtain an accurate model with little support vectors, a method includes two steps is proposed in this paper, in step one, a big ε value is used to select a small number of the support vectors; in step two, by giving these selected support vectors a small value while others a big one, a accurate system model is obtained. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384591","","Cybernetics;Equations;Lagrangian functions;Machine learning;Regression analysis;Support vector machines;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;support vector machines","accurate system model;machine learning;rough system model;support vector machine regression","","0","","12","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20050131","2004","","","418","422","We present the prototype of a tutorial search engine that applies Bayesian learning to generate a ranked list of documents relevant to a given user query. The initial knowledge base used for training was obtained from university students input via the data collecting web page. The search engine is built around an on-going Java tutorial system and encapsulated by a web-based interface. The preliminary tests show a successful search rate of 90% - 100% accuracy by counting whether or not all five top search results are relevant to a user request.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383544","","Bayesian methods;Java;Machine learning algorithms;Packaging;Probability;Prototypes;Search engines;Testing;Tutorial;Web pages","","","","1","","22","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
