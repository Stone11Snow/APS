However, a color histogram only records an image's overall color compositions and no any spatial information is included, and also retrieval precision is limited. In this paper, a color-spatial histogram, which incorporates spatial information with color compositions without sacrificing the robustness of color histograms, is proposed. The purpose is considering the representation role of color compositions and spatial information in the meantime. Each entry in a color-spatial histogram is the color frequency and corresponding position information of the virtual boundary. Experimental evidence suggests that this new color-spatial histogram outperform not only the traditional color histogram method but also the other color-spatial histogram methods for image retrieval.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175405","","Colored noise;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Mathematics;Robustness;Videos","content-based retrieval;image representation;image retrieval;visual databases","color histogram;content-based image retrieval;image annotation;image retrieval;large image database;representation","","0","","10","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the paper, an automatic scheme to register retinal images based on blood vessel feature point extraction is presented. Firstly, the crossover and branching points of the RF (red-free) retinal image and the FA (fluoroscein angiography) retinal image are extracted using a multi-direction exploratory method after the blood vessel visibility is enhanced. Considering the number of feature points extracted on different images are not equal and their location does not correspond between the retinal images, the scheme described in the paper combined the closest interval criterion between the corresponding feature points with a SVD algorithm to accurately register retinal images. Our method compared with previously known ways is an efficient and automatic scheme of retinal image registration. The experimental results indicate the registration of the fluoroscein angiography image with the corresponding red-free retinal image and a series of the fluoroscein angiography images can be also successful using our method.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175389","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175389","","Anatomy;Angiography;Biomedical imaging;Blood vessels;Educational technology;Feature extraction;Image registration;Medical diagnostic imaging;Radio frequency;Retina","biomedical optical imaging;blood vessels;eye;feature extraction;image enhancement;image registration;medical image processing","SVD algorithm;automatic scheme;blood vessels feature point;branching points;clinic diagnoses;closest interval criterion;complementary information;crossover points;fluoroscein angiography retinal image;laser treatment;multi-direction exploratory method;red-free retinal image;retinal image registration;singular value decomposition","","5","2","6","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One popular approach for tackling this problem is to first use an oversized network and then pruning it to a smaller size so as to achieve less computational complexity and better performance in generalization. This paper presents a pruning technique, via a quantified sensitivity measure, to remove as many neurons as possible, those with the least relevance, from the hidden layers of a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The sensitivity of an individual neuron is defined as the expectation of its output deviation due to expected input deviation with respect to the overall inputs from a continuous interval. The relevance of a neuron is defined as the multiplication of its sensitivity value by the summation of its outgoing weights. The basic idea is to iteratively train the network according to a certain performance criterion and then remove the neurons with the lowest relevance values. The pruning technique is novel in its quantified sensitivity measure. Computer simulations demonstrate that it works well.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175337","","Computational complexity;Computer networks;Computer simulation;Electronic mail;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Neurons;Size measurement;Training data","generalisation (artificial intelligence);iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;sensitivity analysis","generalization;hidden neuron pruning;input deviation;iterative learning;multilayer perceptron;sensitivity measure","","4","","14","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the mouth shape parameters Liprounding and the defined viseme similarity weight (VSW) from the 3D viseme facial models, 166 questions concerning the viseme contexts are designed to build triseme decision trees to tie the states of the trisemes with similar contexts, so that they can share the same parameters. To evaluate the system performance, the image related measurements are also taken to evaluate the resulting viseme sequences, with 'jerky instances' in Liprounding and VSW graphs evaluating their smoothness.

First, minimal key path set (MKPS) is defined and an algorithm to find the MKPS online is given. At the same time, for any key path in the MPKS, this algorithm can find out all transactions relevant to it. After scanning the transaction database only once, a relevant matrix is set up, where the key paths in MKPS are taken as columns and the transactions are taken as rows. Compared to previous methods, our method considers the three major features of users' accessing the Web: ordinal, contiguous, and duplicate.

The fundamental objective of ordinal classification is to create an ordering in the universe of discourse. As such, a decision tree for ordinal classification should aim at producing an ordering which is most consistent with the implicit ordering in the input data. Ordinal classification problems are often dealt with by treating ordinal classes as nominal classes, or by representing the classes as values on a quantitative scale. Such approaches may not lead to the most desirable results since the methods do not fit the type of data, viz. ordinal data, concerned. In this paper, we propose a new measure for assessing the quality of output from an ordinal classification approach. We also propose an induction method to generate an ordinal decision tree for ordinal classification based on this quality perspective.

To solve this problem, we introduce the problem of mining cross-table association rules in two tables containing both quantitative, and categorical attributes, and present an algorithm for mining cross-table association rules. The algorithm is based on the projections of itemsets. All large cross-table itemsets can be constructed by their projections directly. It neither needs to join the tables nor creates a universal table or expends any of the tables. The algorithm orients large databases and considers general relationships expressed by semantic correlation attributes between two tables, where the correlation attributes may be keys, foreign keys or other equivalent attributes.

CWM is a novel mechanism presented in this paper, which can improve the performance of synchronous write in cluster file system. CWCNFS has following features: (1) CWCNFS unitizes the advantage of cluster file system, and then can adequately use the network bandwidth and the storage capability; (2) CWCNFS applies cooperative write mechanism on the cluster file system, and can greatly improve the performance; (3) CWCNFS can give normal NFS access interface to clients and do not require any software modification of clients. In this paper, the architecture of CWCNFS and the design of CWM are presented. At last, we take some experiments to validate the performance of CWCNFS.

This paper will develop a real-time vehicle flow-measuring algorithm for complex urban intersection based on multi-detection windows, instead of tracking entire vehicles or extracting the three-dimensional features of the vehicles. For the validity of the multi-detection windows background, we adopt a new background refresh strategy corresponding to the background changing.

It allows users to inject customized programs into the intermediate node of the network. The important difference of active network from traditional network is that active network consists of a series of active network nodes that are able to execute active codes and compute them. So, an active network node is the key of the architecture of active networks. This paper presents a scalable and secure active network node that provides the required flexibility of active network technology for dynamic services customized by users deployment and application-specific data processing and forwarding. In this paper, the composing components and services request interface and active application API are introduced, which make the active network node scalable, and the functions of the composing components can be dynamically extended.

One approach to solve this problem is to add an invisible image to an image that can be used to provide solid proofs of ownership. These invisible images or signatures are known as digital watermarks. In this paper, we will describe a novel technique for watermarking. This technique is implemented in DWT domain. Different from usual watermarking methods, we use two sets of secret key systems, one is called private key and the other, public key. Experimental results show that our method is valid in embedding a watermark in an image and the watermark is robust enough to various attacks.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175374","","Discrete wavelet transforms;Electronic mail;Frequency domain analysis;Information processing;Intellectual property;Multimedia systems;PSNR;Public key;Robustness;Watermarking","cryptography;discrete wavelet transforms;watermarking","DWT;digital watermark;intellectual property rights;networked multimedia systems;private key;public key;secret key systems;watermarking","","0","","8","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A neural visual model (NVM) is used to recognize all possibilities of facial feature positions for the first step. Input parameters are obtained from the face characteristics and the positions of facial features not including any intensity information. For the better results, some incorrect decisions of facial feature positions are improved by image processing technique called dilation.

The algorithm presented is very effective for mining long frequents, and its validity is proved through analysis of computing complexity. Some examples of computation are given. The computing complexity of the algorithm is related to the average length of items reduction, the complexity approximates to 0.5 × M<sup>3</sup>N × 0(2<sup>s</sup> × N'<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case, where S is the average length of items reduction under min-support given by user, N' is the number of tuples in the database, N is the number of transactions in the database and M is the average length of item sets in the database. Using heuristic information for pruning useless candidate frequent itemsets improves the efficiency of the algorithm.

According to these, authors propose the rough set based attribute reduction algorithm. The decision table is judged firstly whether or not it is consistent. To the complete consistent table, using the knowledge of rough set and information theory, authors get attribute reduction set by discernibility matrix, and compute relevance of attributes through conditional entropy. The best attribute reduction is the set which value is the minimum of average of attribute relevance. To the complete inconsistent table, authors make directly the decision rules with rough operator.

Two related key issues are achieving an efficient content-based retrieval and a fast response time. Relevance feedback is a powerful tool to improve the retrieval results of the CBIR systems. However the traditional relevance feedback could only search a small feature subspace comparing with the entire huge feature space. So, this paper provides solutions to enlarge the searching feature subspace in a CBIR system, effectively. Firstly, an adaptive system query strategy to user behaviors is introduced to improve the performance of relevance feedback. Then a feedback scheme based on multi-features classification is developed. Both tactics enlarge the searching feature subspace efficiently. From experimental results, it is clear that the feedback scheme has a much better performance than the traditional CBIR systems. To develop such a scheme, a new effective texture feature and an efficient way to measure the dis-similarity between two image features are proposed in the CBIR system, which provides solutions to a general query on a large image database with 56,600 images.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1174560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174560","","Content based retrieval;Electronic mail;Feedback;Image classification;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information processing;Information retrieval;Mars;Multimedia databases","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;multimedia databases;relevance feedback","content-based image retrieval system;fast response time;feedback learning;image database;low-level features;multi-features classification;multimedia databases;relevance feedback;semantic image retrieval;similarity metric","","3","","24","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
