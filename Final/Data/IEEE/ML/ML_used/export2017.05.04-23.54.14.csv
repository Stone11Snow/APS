Compared with traditional single hidden layer feed forward neural networks, ELM executes with higher training speed and produces smaller error. Due to random input weights and hidden biases, ELM might need numerous hidden neurons to achieve a reasonable accuracy. A new ELM learning algorithm, which was optimized by the Firefly Algorithm (FA), was proposed in this paper. FA was used to select the input weights and biases of hidden layer, and then the output weights could be calculated. To test the validity of proposed method, a simulation experiments about the approximation curves of the SINC function was done. The results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved better performance with less hidden neurons than other similar methods.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5079-4; POD:978-1-4799-0906-3","10.1109/ISCID.2013.147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6804846","extreme learning machine;firefly algorithm;hidden neurons","Approximation algorithms;Feedforward neural networks;Optimization;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","feedforward neural nets;function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence)","ELM learning algorithm;FA;SINC function approximation curves;extreme learning machine;feedforward neural network;firefly algorithm;hidden neurons;input weights;output weights;training speed","","0","","10","","","28-29 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data-dependent statistics are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and data-independent statistics are estimated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of statistic that enter into the gradient of the log likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer pretraining phase that initializes the weights sensibly. The pretraining also allows the variational inference to be initialized sensibly with a single bottom-up pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB data sets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn very good generative models of handwritten digits and 3D objects. We also show that the features discovered by deep Boltzmann machines are a very effective way to initialize the hidden layers of feedforward neural nets, which are then discriminatively fine-tuned.","0899-7667;08997667","","10.1162/NECO_a_00311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797213","","","","","","43","1","","","","Aug. 2012","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

However, many of the tasks that ELM focuses on are single-label, where an instance of the input set is associated with one label. This paper proposes a new method for training ELM that will be capable of multi-label classification using the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). The new method is named CCA-ELM. There are 4 steps in the training process: the first step is to compute any correlations between the input features and the set of labels using CCA, the second step maps the input space and label space to the new space, the third step uses ELM to classify and the last step is to map to the original input space. The experimental results show that CCA-ELM can improve ELM for classification on multi-label learning and its recognition performances are better than the other comparative algorithms that use the same standard CCA.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1424-1; POD:978-1-4799-1421-0","10.1109/KST.2014.6775398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775398","Canonical Correlation Analysis;Extreme Learning Machine;Multi-Label Classification","Correlation;MATLAB;TV;Testing;Training;Vectors","feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CCA-ELM;SLFN;canonical correlation analysis;extreme learning machine;gradient-based neural networks;learning speed;multilabel classification;recognition performances;single layer feedforward neural networks","","2","1","16","","","30-31 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much attention has been paid to the research of multi-label classification algorithms. Considering the fact that the high dimensionality of the multi-label datasets may cause the curse of dimensionality and will hamper the classification process, a dimensionality reduction algorithm, named multi-label kernel discriminant analysis (MLKDA), is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of multi-label datasets. MLKDA, with the kernel trick, processes the multi-label integrally and realizes the nonlinear dimensionality reduction with the idea similar with linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In the classification process of multi-label data, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is an efficient algorithm in the premise of good accuracy. MLKDA, combined with ELM, shows a good performance in multi-label learning experiments with several datasets. The experiments on both static data and data stream show that MLKDA outperforms multi-label dimensionality reduction via dependence maximization (MDDM) and multi-label linear discriminant analysis (MLDA) in cases of balanced datasets and stronger correlation between tags, and ELM is also a good choice for multi-label classification.","","","10.1109/JSEE.2014.00058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6850230","classification;dimensionality reduction;kernel trick;multi-label","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification;Image classification;Kernel;Learning systems;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis;Systems engineering and theory","","","","0","","","","","June 2014","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

Numerous applications have demonstrated the feasibility and high efficiency of ELM-like systems. It has, however, been open if this is true for any general applications. In this two-part paper, we conduct a comprehensive feasibility analysis of ELM. In Part I, we provide an answer to the question by theoretically justifying the following: 1) for some suitable activation functions, such as polynomials, Nadaraya-Watson and sigmoid functions, the ELM-like systems can attain the theoretical generalization bound of the FNNs with all connections adjusted, i.e., they do not degrade the generalization capability of the FNNs even when the connections with and within hidden neurons are randomly fixed; 2) the number of hidden neurons needed for an ELM-like system to achieve the theoretical bound can be estimated; and 3) whenever the activation function is taken as polynomial, the deduced hidden layer output matrix is of full column-rank, therefore the generalized inverse technique can be efficiently applied to yield the solution of an ELM-like system, and, furthermore, for the nonpolynomial case, the Tikhonov regularization can be applied to guarantee the weak regularity while not sacrificing the generalization capability. In Part II, however, we reveal a different aspect of the feasibility of ELM: there also exists some activation functions, which makes the corresponding ELM degrade the generalization capability. The obtained results underlie the feasibility and efficiency of ELM-like systems, and yield various generalizations and improvements of the systems as well.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2335212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6861448","Extreme learning machine (ELM);feasibility;generalization capability;neural networks;neural networks.","Biological neural networks;Estimation;Kernel;Learning systems;Neurons;Polynomials;Training","feedforward neural nets;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);transfer functions","ELM-like systems;FNN;Nadaraya-Watson functions;Tikhonov regularization;activation functions;extreme learning machine;feedforward neural network;full column-rank;generalization capability;generalized inverse technique;hidden layer output matrix;hidden neurons;learning system;sigmoid functions","0","28","","42","","20140721","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper addresses this problem by taking advantage from a non-iterative tuning capability of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for paddy growth stages classification using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) remote sensing images. The accuracy of classification is measured by Cohen's kappa. Seven classes are used in classification, with consist of six classes for paddy growth stages and one class for dominated cloud. The contribution of this study is a new ensemble incremental approaches based on random bootstrap resampling for basic ELM (B-ELM) and Error Minimized ELM (EM-ELM) are applied to build multi-class classifier using two types of hidden nodes function, i.e. additive and radial basis function (RBF) hidden nodes. The classification results were compared each other with these two types of hidden nodes.

In this paper, we propose to utilize a two-layer Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) to learn enhanced features from existing contrast-based low-level features, which are more discriminative and reliable. A saliency computation model is then trained to build a mapping from those enhanced features to eye fixation data.

Recently, ELMs have been built in an automatic way through evolutionary algorithms. Most works, nonetheless, do not uses all population obtained, but choose only one individual in the last generation. In an attempt to improve performance, an ensemble is a more promising choice because a pool of classifiers might produce higher accuracy than merely using the information from only one classifier among them. One of the most important factors for optimum accuracy is the diversity of the classifier pool. In this work, an enhanced Differential Evolution incorporating sharing function method is used to generate a pool of ELMs. Fitness Sharing that shares resources if the distance between the individuals is smaller than the sharing radius is a representative specification method, which produces diverse results than standard evolutionary algorithms that converge to only one solution.

In this paper, we present an automated fall detection approach that requires only a low-cost depth camera. Our approach combines two computer vision techniques-shape-based fall characterization and a learning-based classifier to distinguish falls from other daily actions. Given a fall video clip, we extract curvature scale space (CSS) features of human silhouettes at each frame and represent the action by a bag of CSS words (BoCSS). Then, we utilize the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier to identify the BoCSS representation of a fall from those of other actions. In order to eliminate the sensitivity of ELM to its hyperparameters, we present a variable-length particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the number of hidden neurons, corresponding input weights, and biases of ELM. Using a low-cost Kinect depth camera, we build an action dataset that consists of six types of actions (falling, bending, sitting, squatting, walking, and lying) from ten subjects. Experimenting with the dataset shows that our approach can achieve up to 91.15% sensitivity, 77.14% specificity, and 86.83% accuracy.

The most prominent advantage of active RFID IPS comes from its unique identification of different objects in indoor environment. However, certain drawbacks of existing RFID IPSs, such as high cost of RFID readers and active tags, as well as heavy dependence on the density of reference tags to provide the location based service, largely limit the applications of active RFID IPS. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we develop a cost-efficient RFID IPS by using cheaper active RFID tags, sensors and reader. In addition, one localization algorithm: integrated Weighted Path Loss (WPL) - Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which combines the fast estimation of WPL and the high localization accuracy of ELM is proposed. According to the algorithm, an indoor environment is divided into small zones firstly and an ELM model is developed for each zone during the offline phase. During the online phase, the WPL approach is used to determine the zone of the target primarily, then the ELM model of that zone is deployed to provide the final estimated location of the target.

On the basis of our experiments, the MLM achieves results that are comparable to many de facto standard methods for classification with the advantage of offering a computationally lighter alternative to such approaches.","2377-0589;23770589","Electronic:978-1-4799-3194-1; POD:978-1-4799-2232-1","10.1109/BRICS-CCI-CBIC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6855855","","Accuracy;Equations;Estimation;Mathematical model;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern classification;regression analysis","distance matrices;minimal learning machine;multidimensional output spaces;multiresponse classification problems;multiresponse regression problems;nonlinear problems;pattern classification;supervised learning method","","0","","13","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when the winding speed increases, the passive device may not be able to react quickly enough so that a sudden change in the tension will likely cause the enameled wire to vibrate. Consequently, the motor winding quality will be affected. In order to cope with this difficulty, instead of using a passive device, this paper proposes an active tension control scheme, in which the wire tension measured by a load cell is used as the feedback signal of the tension control loop. Moreover, feedforward control and iterative learning control are integrated into the proposed tension control scheme to improve system response and suppress the periodic disturbance arising from the winding process. Several motor winding experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the proposed approach.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3195-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-3197-2; POD:978-1-4799-3198-9","10.1109/InfoSEEE.2014.6946200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6946200","automatic motor winding;iterative learning control;tension control","Educational institutions;Feedback control;Feedforward neural networks;Hysteresis motors;Process control;Windings;Wires","adaptive control;feedback;iterative methods;learning systems;machine control;machine windings","active tension control improvement;automatic stator in-slot winding machines;feedback signal;feedforward control;iterative learning control;periodic disturbance suppression;tension control loop;winding process;wire tension","","1","","11","","","26-28 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WiFi technology has been studied and explored to provide indoor positioning service for years since existing WiFi infrastructures in indoor environment can be used to greatly reduce the deployment costs. A large body of WiFi based IPSs adopt the fingerprinting approach as the localization algorithm. However, these WiFi based IPSs suffer from two major problems: the intensive costs on manpower and time for offline site survey and the inflexibility to environmental dynamics. In this paper, we propose an indoor localization algorithm based on online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) to address these problems accordingly. The fast learning speed of OS-ELM can reduce the time and manpower costs for the offline site survey, and more importantly, its online sequential learning ability enables the proposed localization algorithm to automatically and timely adapt to the environmental dynamics. The experimental results show that the proposed localization algorithm can provide higher localization accuracy than traditional approaches due to its fast adaptation to various environmental changes.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3459-1; POD:978-1-4799-5071-3; USB:978-1-4799-3460-7","10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6803130","","Accuracy;Calibration;Heuristic algorithms;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mathematical model;Testing;Training","indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless LAN;wireless channels","OS-ELM approach;WiFi based indoor positioning system;WiFi technology;deployment cost reduction;environmental dynamics inflexibility;fingerprinting approach;indoor environment;indoor localization algorithm;location based service;manpower costs;offline site survey;online sequential extreme learning machine approach","","10","","10","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IMAT interpolates each feature of the original vector pattern into its corresponding <i>k</i>-means slots so as to generate a matrix pattern with more structural information. Furthermore, the pairwise information of every two features can be introduced into the IMAT. After that, the IMAT can be applied into matrix-based classifiers. The contributions of the proposed IMAT are listed as follows. (i) the IMAT can extract more intrinsic structural information compared with those random techniques reshaping the vector into a matrix.

Therefore, ELM training is essentially a linear learning problem, which significantly reduces the computational burden. Numerous applications show that such a computation burden reduction does not degrade the generalization capability. It has, however, been open that whether this is true in theory. The aim of this paper is to study the theoretical feasibility of ELM by analyzing the pros and cons of ELM. In the previous part of this topic, we pointed out that via appropriately selected activation functions, ELM does not degrade the generalization capability in the sense of expectation. In this paper, we launch the study in a different direction and show that the randomness of ELM also leads to certain negative consequences. On one hand, we find that the randomness causes an additional uncertainty problem of ELM, both in approximation and learning. On the other hand, we theoretically justify that there also exist activation functions such that the corresponding ELM degrades the generalization capability. In particular, we prove that the generalization capability of ELM with Gaussian kernel is essentially worse than that of FNN with Gaussian kernel. To facilitate the use of ELM, we also provide a remedy to such a degradation. We find that the well-developed coefficient regularization technique can essentially improve the generalization capability. The obtained results reveal the essential characteristic of ELM in a certain sense and give theoretical guidance concerning how to use ELM.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2336665","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6862852","Extreme learning machine (ELM);Gaussian kernel;generalization capability;neural networks","Approximation error;Degradation;Kernel;Learning systems;Neurons;Uncertainty","Gaussian distribution;approximation theory;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence)","ELM approximation;FNN learning system;Gaussian kernel;coefficient regularization technique;extreme learning machine;feed-forward neural network;generalization capability;uncertainty problem","0","25","","37","","20140723","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Considering uncertain factors, actual load data and real time meteorological data are used to train a forecasting model based on RFM-ELM, which improves the load forecasting accuracy effectively. RFM-ELM adopts the latest training sample and abandons the oldest training sample iteratively to achieve the online training of network weights. The structural risk is integrated into the model in order to enhance the generalization ability and robustness of the load-forecasting model.

While some optimization tools exist to help the controller in some airports, even in these situations, the real sequence of the aircraft adopted by the controller is significantly different from the one proposed by the optimization algorithm. This is due to the very dynamic nature of the environment. The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that one can learn from the sequence adopted by the controller some strategies that can act as heuristics in decision support tools for aircraft sequencing. This aim is tested in this paper by attempting to learn sequences generated from a well-known sequencing method that is being used in the real world. The approach relies on a genetic algorithm (GA) to learn these sequences using a society Probabilistic Finite-state Machines (PFSMs). Each PFSM learns a different sub-space; thus, decomposing the learning problem into a group of agents that need to work together to learn the overall problem.

This method is developed based on learning algorithm-Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) combined with the concept of Chous Pseudo-Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) composition. PseAAC is a combination of a set of discrete sequence correlation factors and the 20 components of the conventional amino acid composition, so this method can observe a remarkable improvement in prediction quality. ELM classifier is selected as prediction engine, which is a kind of accurate and fast-learning innovative classification method based on the random generation of the input-to-hidden-units weights followed by the resolution of the linear equations to obtain the hidden-to-output weights.

This creates cubically many parameters, which form a three-dimensional interaction tensor. We describe a low-rank approximation to this interaction tensor that uses a sum of factors, each of which is a three-way outer product. This approximation allows efficient learning of transformations between larger image patches. Since each factor can be viewed as an image filter, the model as a whole learns optimal filter pairs for efficiently representing transformations. We demonstrate the learning of optimal filter pairs from various synthetic and real image sequences. We also show how learning about image transformations allows the model to perform a simple visual analogy task, and we show how a completely unsupervised network trained on transformations perceives multiple motions of transparent dot patterns in the same way as humans.","0899-7667;08997667","","10.1162/neco.2010.01-09-953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6796252","","","","","","28","","","","","June 2010","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Hence the lack of information makes dynamic scheduling problems harder than static ones. In this paper, the learning agent based scheduling system is developed to dynamically schedule machines in parallel. The scheduling system contains the learning agent and the system environment. The agent is trained by the Q-Learning algorithm, and the best rule is selected according to the current state of the system, while the system environment executes the rule selected by the agent. In the simulation experiment, the proposed agent uses the rules of SPT, EDD and FCFS as actions, and is tested with two objectives: minimizing the maximum lateness and minimizing percentage of tardy jobs.

Based on support vector machine (SVM), this paper proposed an adaptive learning procedure intending to keep the classification accuracy. The general idea was to rearrange the training samples of the classifier in real-time by measuring their Kuhn-Tucker (KT) conditions. To regulating the learning effectiveness and system complexity, a forgetting factor was applied to each EMG sample considering its life period. The proposed learning algorithm was validated on a multi-session MES dataset collected from a series of control scenarios, within which the myoelectric signals were collected from two healthy subjects while performing a large variety of finger motions.

In the hidden layer (feature mapping), nodes are randomly generated independently of training data. Furthermore, a unified ELM was proposed, providing a single framework to simplify and unify different learning methods, such as SLFNs, least square support vector machines, proximal support vector machines, and so on. However, the solution of unified ELM is dense, and thus, usually plenty of storage space and testing time are required for large-scale applications. In this paper, a sparse ELM is proposed as an alternative solution for classification, reducing storage space and testing time. In addition, unified ELM obtains the solution by matrix inversion, whose computational complexity is between quadratic and cubic with respect to the training size. It still requires plenty of training time for large-scale problems, even though it is much faster than many other traditional methods. In this paper, an efficient training algorithm is specifically developed for sparse ELM. The quadratic programming problem involved in sparse ELM is divided into a series of smallest possible sub-problems, each of which are solved analytically. Compared with SVM, sparse ELM obtains better generalization performance with much faster training speed.

"Filtering image-based spam using multifractal analysis and active learning feedback-driven semi-supervised support vector machine","Jian Zhong; YiLu Zhou; Wei Deng","Information Technology Center, Southwest University, Chongqing, China","IEEE Conference Anthology","20140410","2013","","","1","5","Traditional anti-spam technologies can't block image-based spam because spammers employ a variety of image creation and randomization algorithms to make the message fully legible by the human eye but undistinguishable by the most anti-spam engines. In this paper we propose a novel composite method to filter image-based spam accurately and effectively, which can be easily implemented as a plug-in in SpamAssassin. Our method takes advantage of the two natures of image-based spams: large quantity, similarity and character variability. For the first nature, we use rules of SpamAssassin to detect the emails characteristic. If a new email has been identified as spam by the rules, it will be blocked. Otherwise, image-based mail will be captured by the plug-in. For the second nature,the plug-in will use multifractal analysis in multi-orientation wavelet pyramid algorithm to get image-based email texture descriptor which has strong invariance to many factors, use a hybrid filter-wrapper feature subset selection algorithm based on particle swarm optimization to reduce some redundant or irrelevant features in the texture descriptor, and use a semi-supervised support vector machines classification algorithm to detect whether an email is ham or spam, then use active learning clustering to get the most representative emails for relabeling through user feedback. The relabeled emails by users feedback and the unlabeled suspect spams by SVM will be used to retrain the classification for improving accuracy of spam filter. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is of high efficiency, high accuracy and low false positive rate. The accuracy will be improved and the false positive rate will be reduced along with more and more retraining. So, the method is fit especially for an adversarial learning and processing like spam filtering.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1660-3","10.1109/ANTHOLOGY.2013.6784950","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784950","Active Learning Cluseting;Feedback-Driven Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine;Image-Based Spam;Multifractal Analysis","Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Filtering algorithms;Fractals;Lead;Support vector machines","","","","2","","18","","","1-8 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To account for the uncertainties in the forecasting results, several bootstrap methods have been compared for modeling the regression uncertainty, based on which the pairs bootstrap method is identified with the best performance. Consequently, a new method for prediction intervals formulation based on the ELM and the pairs bootstrap is developed. Wind power forecasting has been conducted in different seasons using the proposed approach with the historical wind power time series as the inputs alone.

The proposed ELMs are developed by innovative decomposition of the recursive orthogonal least squares procedure into sequential partial orthogonalization (SPO). The salient features of the proposed approaches are as follows: 1) Initial hidden nodes are randomly generated by the ELM methodology and recursively orthogonalized into an upper triangular matrix with dramatic reduction in matrix size; 2) the constructive SPO in the CP-ELM focuses on the partial matrix with the subcolumn of the selected regressor including nonzeros as the first column while the destructive SPO in the DP-ELM operates on the partial matrix including elements determined by the removed regressor; 3) termination criteria for CP- and DP-ELM are simplified by the additional residual error reduction method; and 4) the output weights of the SLFN need not be solved in the model selection procedure and is derived from the final upper triangular equation by backward substitution.

A widely accepted approach is based on flux distribution or back EMF (BEM) model of the machine to calculate healthy phase currents. This is essentially an open-loop technique where currents are determined (based on motor fault models) for each fault scenario. Therefore, it is highly model dependent. Since torque pulsation due to open-circuit faults and short-circuit faults are periodic, learning and repetitive control algorithms are excellent choices to minimize torque ripple. In this paper, iterative learning control (ILC) is applied as a current control technique for recovering performance in multiphase PM motor drives under fault conditions. The ILC-based FTC needs torque measurement or estimation, but avoids the need for complicated fault detection and fault diagnosis algorithms. Furthermore, BEM-based FTC and ILC-based FTC are proposed that initiates the learning from a model-based approximate guess (from the BEM method). Therefore, this method combines the advantages of both model information as well as robustness to model uncertainty through learning. Hence, the proposed method is well suited for high-performance safety critical applications. Finite element analysis and experimental results on a five-phase PM machine are presented for verification of the proposed control schemes.","2168-6777;21686777","","10.1109/JESTPE.2013.2295537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690171","Fault-tolerant control;Permanent-magnet machine;fault-tolerant control;five-phase machines;iterative learning control;permanent-magnet machine","Circuit faults;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Permanent magnet motors;Power electronics;Stator windings;Torque","electric current control;electric potential;fault diagnosis;fault tolerant control;finite element analysis;machine control;permanent magnet motors;torque measurement","BEM model;FTC techniques;ILC;back EMF;current control technique;fault detection;fault diagnosis algorithms;fault tolerant control;fault tolerant operation;finite element analysis;flux distribution;iterative learning control;multiphase PM motors;multiphase permanent magnet machines;ohmic losses;open circuit faults;phase currents;ripple free torque;short circuit faults;torque estimation;torque measurement;torque pulsation","","18","","26","","20131220","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In other words, we aim to compensate the slow sensor dynamics in industrial machine vision systems. The common approach is to predict the present target motion by propagating the delayed estimates with the target dynamics. Such method is sometimes problematic since the target motion characteristics (i.e., target dynamics) may change from one visual servoing task to another. Therefore, this paper presents a method which is able to estimate the target pose as well as learn the target dynamics.

P300, a component of Event Related Potentials (ERPs), is a widely used feature component of EEG signal for BCI applications. However, single trial analysis is difficult since ERPs such as P300 signals have a very low signal to noise ratio, which bring down the communication rate. And the numerous number of channels needed to record EEG prevents the popularization of BCI applications due to the complexity and high cost of the system.

For example, two similar frames may have different meanings in describing human actions such as starting to run and starting to walk. In order to associate richer information to vector-quantization and generate visual words, several approaches have been proposed recently that use complex algorithms to extract or learn spatio-temporal features from 3-D volumes of video frames. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to use Gaussian RBMs for learning motion-difference features from actions in videos. The difference between two video frames is defined by a subtraction function of one frame by another that preserves positive and negative changes, thus creating a simple spatio-temporal saliency map for an action. This subtraction function removes, by construction, the common shapes and background images that should not be relevant for action learning and recognition, and highlights the movement patterns in space, making it easier to learn the actions from such saliency maps using shallow feature learning models such as RBMs. In the experiments reported in this paper, we used a Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine to learn the actions from saliency maps of different motion images. Despite its simplicity, the motion-difference method achieved very good performance in benchmark datasets, specifically the Weizmann dataset (98.81%) and the KTH dataset (88.89%). A comparative analysis with hand-crafted and learned features using similar classifiers indicates that motion-difference can be competitive and very efficient.","2161-4393;21614393","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6627-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-1484-5; POD:978-1-4799-1482-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889945","","Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Shape;Support vector machines;Training;Video sequences;Visualization","image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);vector quantisation;video signal processing","3D volumes;Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machines;Weizmann dataset;human action recognition;learning motion-difference features;motion-difference method;saliency maps;shallow feature learning models;spatio-temporal feature learning;vector-quantization;video frames;visual word learning","","1","","28","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Manual detection of spindles is tedious and time-consuming, hence many attempts have been performed to automatically detect them. Scientists have found that spindles are related to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Schizophrenia. Therefore, designing algorithms to extract certain spindle features to diagnose them with high accuracy is valuable. In this study, new chaotic features, along with a new training and classification algorithm has been used to detect spindles: an algorithm called MELM-GRBF (Modified Extreme Learning Machine). GBRF (Generalized Radial Basis Function) can update the radial basis function (RBF) using a parameter (τ), and the training algorithm is MELM. GRBF centers are selected randomly from the training data. The width and the parameter τ of GRBF are achieved considering two limitations: locality and coverage. In order to have the most similarity between spindle and non-spindle segments and to demonstrate the capability of these (chaotic features and classifier) algorithms, non-spindles are extracted immediately before spindles occur for one second in sleep stage two. After presenting chaotic (Higuchi Fractal Dimension, Katz Fractal Dimension, Sevcik Fractal Dimension, Largest Lyapunov and Entropy) and time series features, the ELM-RBF and MELM-GRBF statistical results are compared.

Thus, an accurate early detection on hypoglycemia is an important research topic. With the use of new emerging technology, an extreme learning machine (ELM) based hypoglycemia detection system is developed to recognize the presence of hypoglycemic episodes.

Optical images stand out from other remote sensing images in object detection due to their higher resolution and more visualized contents. However, most of the popular techniques for ship detection from optical spaceborne images have two shortcomings: 1) Compared with infrared and synthetic aperture radar images, their results are affected by weather conditions, like clouds and ocean waves, and 2) the higher resolution results in larger data volume, which makes processing more difficult. Most of the previous works mainly focus on solving the first problem by improving segmentation or classification with complicated algorithms. These methods face difficulty in efficiently balancing performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose a ship detection approach to solving the aforementioned two issues using wavelet coefficients extracted from JPEG2000 compressed domain combined with deep neural network (DNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Compressed domain is adopted for fast ship candidate extraction, DNN is exploited for high-level feature representation and classification, and ELM is used for efficient feature pooling and decision making.

The multi-kernel learning (MKL) framework Simple MKL iteratively determines the combination of kernels by gradient descent wrapping a standard support vector machine (SVM) solver. Simple MKL can be applied to many kinds of supervised learning problems to receive a more stable performance with rapid convergence speed. This paper proposes a new approach: MK-ELM (multi-kernel extreme learning machine) that applies Simple MKL framework to the optimization-based ELM algorithm. The performance analysis on binary classification problems with various scales shows that MK-ELM tends to achieve the best generalization performance as well as being the most insensitive to parameters comparing to optimization-based ELM and Simple MKL.

The MRELM can simultaneously consider the geometrical structure and discriminative information in EEG data. Using differential entropy features across whole five frequency bands, the average accuracy of MRELM is 81.01%, which is better than those obtained by GELM (80.25%) and SVM (76.62%). The accuracies obtained from high frequency band features (β, γ) are obviously superior to those of low frequency band features, which shows β and γ bands are more relevant to emotional states transition. Moreover, experiments are conducted to further evaluate the efficacy of MRELM, where the training and test sets are from different sessions.

In this paper, we extend ELMs for both semi-supervised and unsupervised tasks based on the manifold regularization, thus greatly expanding the applicability of ELMs. The key advantages of the proposed algorithms are as follows: 1) both the semi-supervised ELM (SS-ELM) and the unsupervised ELM (US-ELM) exhibit learning capability and computational efficiency of ELMs; 2) both algorithms naturally handle multiclass classification or multicluster clustering; and 3) both algorithms are inductive and can handle unseen data at test time directly. Moreover, it is shown in this paper that all the supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised ELMs can actually be put into a unified framework. This provides new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of random feature mapping, which is the key concept in ELM theory. Empirical study on a wide range of data sets demonstrates that the proposed algorithms are competitive with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2307349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6766243","Clustering;embedding;extreme learning machine (ELM);manifold regularization;semi-supervised learning;unsupervised learning","Clustering algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Laplace equations;Manifolds;Neurons;Supervised learning;Training","pattern classification;pattern clustering;regression analysis;unsupervised learning","ELM theory;manifold regularization;multiclass classification;multicluster clustering;pattern classification;regression;semisupervised extreme learning machines;unsupervised extreme learning machines","0","98","","63","","20140312","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has advantages of very fast learning speed and good generalization ability, it is chosen to be the base classifier in the ensemble. Besides, majority voting is incorporated for fusion of classification results from the ensemble of base classifiers. In order to further increase testing accuracy, ELM autoencoder is implemented as a pre-training step. In automatic liver tumor detection, ELM is trained as a one-class classifier with only healthy liver samples, and the performance is compared with two-class ELM.

In order to form an interaction that is more natural between human and com-puter, the computer should be able to discern and respond to human emotion. In this paper, an approach for recognizing human emotion is proposed. The proposed approach operates HAAR-classifier to detect mouth, eyes, and eyebrow on face, and, to extract features from them, it uses Gabor wavelet. Before classifying the features, PCA is performed to reduce its dimension. The proposed framework employs SLFNs with ELM as its learning algorithm to classify the features. In this experimental, the proposed framework is tested in two cases, personalize and generalize face case, with ten subjects expressing six basic emotions and neural state. The robustness of ELM is evaluated with comparing it to K-NN and SVM. Preliminary experiment shows that the proposed approach has promising performance in personalize face case.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5100-0; POD:978-1-4799-5101-7","10.1109/ICAICTA.2014.7005961","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7005961","Extreme Learning Machine;Gabor Wavelet;Human Computer Interaction;Human Emotion Recognition;SLFNs","Emotion recognition;Face;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Mouth;Support vector machines;Training","emotion recognition;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;principal component analysis;wavelet transforms","ELM;Gabor wavelet;HAAR-classifier;K-NN;PCA;SLFN;SVM;extreme learning machine;eye detection;eyebrow detection;feature classification;feature extraction;human emotion recognition;learning algorithm;mouth detection;single layer feedforward network;support vector machine","","1","","23","","","20-21 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As for the ELM, the solution to this multiclass optimization problem leads to a system of linear equations. Due to the sparse Laplacian matrix built from the lattice graph defined on the image pixels, the optimization problem is solved in a linear time.
