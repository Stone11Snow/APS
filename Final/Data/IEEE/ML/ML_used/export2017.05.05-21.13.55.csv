Our major contributions are: (1) to present a system to perform feature selection from high-dimensional data; (2) to analyze the change of system architecture according to the time cost of the parts in the system; (3) to summarize and comment on the calculations of feature correlation; (4) to perform experiments to show the effective of the proposed approach, which has shown that the system can efficiently get a better compromise between dimensionality reduction and accuracy rate of classification than just part of the system. In many cases, it can improve the accuracy rate and dimensionality reduction.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382051","","Clustering algorithms;Costs;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Machine learning;Optical computing;Optical filters;Optical materials;Pattern recognition","computational complexity;correlation theory;feature extraction;filtering theory;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering;set theory","NP-hard problems;classification accuracy;dimensionality reduction;feature class correlation;feature clustering algorithm;feature selection;feature-feature correlation;high dimensional data;information retrieval;large scale feature set;machine learning;optimal feature subset;pattern recognition;system architecture;two level filter model system","","1","","10","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This algorithm can capture two levels of inter-time-series interaction behavior among a large set of time series: (i) group level, which includes the merges and splits of clusters, and (ii) individual-to-group level, such as a time series joins or leaves a cluster. In order to do so, it first reduces the TS set into a system morphing graph, a multipartite graph is employed to represent the latent interactions, and then extract strong interaction patterns from this graph. A system morphing graph is built by three steps: firstly, the input time series set is divided into sets of segments along the time line, and each segment set serves as a partite of the graph; then, each segment set is clustered and the resulting clusters serves as the vertices in the graph; third, the edges are built according to member-sharing relationships between clusters. System morphing graphs can model the captured TS interactions. Because this algorithm both cuts and concatenates time series, it does not fit into either whole clustering or subsequence clustering.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382058","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bayesian methods;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Cybernetics;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms","graph theory;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;time series","cluster segmentation;latent interaction representation;morphing cluster dynamics;multipartite graph;pattern extraction;system morphing graph;time series clustering algorithm","","1","","12","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

AHSC can be used for classifying multi-class data by integrating a series of polynomial networks based on binary numbers, which are used for labeling the classes of samples. The problem that multi-class data cannot always be separated by a single polynomial is solved by AHSC. Moreover, using an adaptive method can choose the order of polynomial.

Aimed at hybrid knowledge reduction using the uniform rough approximations, we give a new interpretation to Yager's entropy from ""knowledge granules"" and present the concept and definitions of ""granular entropy"".

This paper addresses the problem of feature selection for machine learning through a correlation and MSVM (modified support vector machines) based approach. The central hypothesis is that a good feature set contains features that are highly correlated with the class, yet uncorrelated with each other. So we introduce the CMFS (correlation and MSVM-based feature selection). First, CMFS ranks the features using MSVM according to their correlation with the class. Secondly, CMFS uses a forward selection search with correlation-based method to form feature subset. A feature can be added to the feature set or not decided by the class separability of the feature and the correlation with the already chosen features.

A solution to this problem is to assign weights to features that indicate their salience for classification. Current weighting methods can be divided as global weighting, partial local weighting, and local weighting methods enumerated in increasing order of capability to capture the features' relative salience in classification. However, the existing methods are not sensitive enough to describe the salience of a feature and can be changed given different queries. We suggest that the salience of a feature, in addition to being sensitive to the instance (i.e. varies across instances), should also be sensitive to the variations in the difference of a feature's values between a query and the instances in the instance base. In this paper, we put forward a dynamic feature weighting approach which has more expressive capability, and present a sketch of a classification algorithm based on the notion of dynamic weights.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382206","","Distance measurement;Information science;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Nearest neighbor searches;Neural networks;Retirement","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","dynamic feature weighting approach;global weighting method;local weighting method;nearest neighbor classifier;partial local weighting method","","2","","11","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Machine learning techniques are finding more and more applications in the field of load forecasting. A novel regression technique, called support vector machines (SVM), based on the statistical learning theory is explored in this paper for the prediction of natural gas demands. SVM is based on the principle of structure risk minimization as opposed to the principle of empirical risk minimization supported by the conventional regression techniques. Least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) is a kind of SVM that has different cost function with respect to standard SVM.

However for the class number of remote sensing image is much great, manually obtaining of training samples is a much time-consuming work.

In this paper, we present a variant of Q-learning that learns a pair of utilities for worlds with dichotomous attributes and show that this algorithm properly balances the competing objectives and, as a result, efficiently identifies satisficing solutions. This occurs because exploration of the environment is restricted to those options which, according to current knowledge, are likely to avoid unjustifiable exposure to risk. We empirically validate the algorithm by (a) showing that the algorithm quickly converges to good policies in several simulated worlds of various complexities and (b) applying the algorithm to learning a force feedback profile for a gas pedal that helps drivers avoid risky situations.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383495","","Computer science;Convergence;Decision making;Force feedback;Lead;Learning;Robust control;State estimation","","","","2","","14","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel fusion algorithm is presented for multisensor images based on discrete multiwavelet transform that can be performed at pixel level. After the registering of source images, a pyramid for each source image can be obtained by applying decomposition with multiwavelet in each level. The multiwavelet decomposition coefficients of the input images are appropriately merged and a new fused image is obtained by reconstructing the fused multiwavelet coefficients. This image fusion algorithm may be used to combine images from multisensors to obtain a single composite with extended information content.

Neural networks have been widely used in Landsat image classification because they are unbiased by data distribution. However, they need long training times for the network to get satisfactory classification accuracy. The data-clustering algorithm is based on fuzzy inferences using radial basis functions and clustering in input space. It only passes training data once so it has a short training tune. It can also generate fuzzy classification, which is appropriate in the case of mixed, intermediate or complex cover pattern pixels. This algorithm is applied in the land cover classification of Landsat 7 ETM+ over the Rio Rancho area, New Mexico. It is compared with back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to illustrate its effectiveness and concluded that it can get a better classification using shorter training time.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384607","","Clustering algorithms;Content addressable storage;Gaussian distribution;Humans;Image classification;Indexing;Neural networks;Remote sensing;Satellites;Self organizing feature maps","backpropagation;fuzzy logic;geophysical signal processing;image classification;inference mechanisms;pattern clustering;radial basis function networks","backpropagation neural network;data clustering algorithm;fuzzy classification;fuzzy inferences;multispectral Landsat image classification;pattern pixels;radial basis functions","","0","","6","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The final results are obtained through inverse wavelet and IHS transforms, respectively. The highlight of our method is regional edge intensity (REI) based self-adaptive fusion.

This network is a simplified version of the focused gamma network and an extension of TDNN as it incorporates a priori knowledge available about the task into the network architecture. As an example, the estimations produced by the methodology were applied on 8 different weather forecasting data provided by the Shanghai Meteorology Centre to make the result more practical. The results confirm that proposed solutions have the potential for successful application to the problem of temperature and rainfall estimation, and the relationships between the factors that contribute to certain weather conditions can be estimated at a certain extent.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384579","","Computational intelligence;Computational modeling;Data preprocessing;Differential equations;Discrete wavelet transforms;Meteorology;Neural networks;Predictive models;Temperature;Weather forecasting","differential equations;estimation theory;forecasting theory;neural net architecture;rain;weather forecasting","Shanghai Meteorology Centre;computational algorithms;data preprocessing technique;differential equations;dynamic weighted time delay neural networks;gamma network;intelligent weather forecast;meteorological phenomena;neural network architecture;rainfall estimation;rainfall forecasting;short term temperature estimation;weather conditions estimation;weather forecasting data;weighting function","","4","","6","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach has been successfully employed in TEXTALTM, a system that retrieves previously solved 3D patterns of electron density from a database to determine the structure of proteins. Electron density patterns are characterized by numeric features and an appropriate distance measure is used to efficiently jilter good matches through an exhaustive search of the database. These matches are then examined using a computationally expensive density correlation procedure based on jinding an optimal superposition between 3D patterns. We provide an empirical and theoretical analysis of some of the keys issues related to this method. In particular, we dejine a model for estimating how approximate various featurebased similarity measures are (relative to an objective matching metric), and determine its relation to the number of cases that should be jiltered from a given database to make the approach effective.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383539","","Computer science;Crystallography;Databases;Electrons;Information retrieval;Matched filters;Particle measurements;Pattern matching;Predictive models;Proteins","","","","1","","20","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By doing that we can have the forces predicted directly from kinematic variables while bypassing the costly procedure of measuring EMG (electromyography) signals and avoiding the use of biomechanics model. In the proposed model, we introduce the EMG signal as an intermediate output and loop it back to the input layer, instead of looping back the ultimate output, the forces. Since the EMG signal is a direct reflection of muscle activity, the most valuable point of this model is that the back-looping of the intermediate output has physical meaning. It solves the problem that the input and output of the system have no direct and explicit physical connection. At the same time, the advantages of recurrent neural network are utilized.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383536","","Biomechanics;Electromyography;Electronic mail;Force measurement;Kinematics;Muscles;Neural networks;Neurofeedback;Predictive models;Recurrent neural networks","","","","0","","13","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20050131","2004","","","3","4","Data mining is the process of posing queries and extracting patterns, often previously unknown from large quantities of data using pattern matching or other reasoning techniques. Cyber security is the area that deals with cyber terrorism. We are hearing that cyber attacks will cause corporations billions of dollars. For example, one could masquerade as a legitimate user and swindle say a bank of billions of dollars. Data mining and web mining may be used to detect and possibly prevent security attacks including cyber attacks. For example, anomaly detection techniques could be used to detect unusual patterns and behaviors. Link analysis may be used to trace the viruses to the perpetrators. Classification may be used to group various cyber attacks and then use the profiles to detect an attack when it occurs. Prediction may be used to determine potential future attacks depending in a way on information learnt about terrorists through email and phone conversations. Also, for some threats non real-time data mining may suffice while for certain other threats such as for network intrusions we may need real-time data mining. Many researchers are investigating the use of data mining for intrusion detection. While we need some form of real-time data mining, that is, the results have to be generated in real-time, we also need to build models in real-time. For example, credit card fraud detection is a form of real-time processing. However, here models are built ahead of time. Building models in real-time remains a challenge. Data mining can also be used for analyzing web logs as well as analyzing the audit trails. Based on the results of the data mining tool, one can then determine whether any unauthorized intrusions have occurred and/or whether any unauthorized queries have been posed. There has been much research on data mining for intrusion detection. Data mining may also be applied for Biometrics related applications. Finally data mining has applications in national securi- y including detecting and preventing terrorist activities. The presentation will provide an overview of data mining and security threats and then discuss the applications of data mining for cyber security and national security including in intrusion detection and biometrics.

The controller is given the capability for obstacle avoidance by using negative fuzzy rules in conjunction with traditional positive ones. Negative fuzzy rules prescribe actions to be avoided rather than performed. A rule base of positive rules is specified by an expert for directing the robot to the target in the absence of obstacles, while a rule base of negative rules is experimentally determined from operation of the robot in the presence of obstacles. The consequents of the negative-rule system are codified into a chromosome, and this chromosome is evolved using an evolutionary algorithm.

Proceedings.","20050131","2004","","","312","319","Association rules are a data mining cornerstone. Association rules greatest impact is in helping to make decisions. One association rule quality measure is a rule's decision value. Association rules are often constructed using simplifying assumptions that lead to naive results and consequently naive decisions. Perhaps the greatest impact on decision value quality comes from treating association rules as causal statements without understanding whether there is, in fact, underlying causality. Complete knowledge of all possible factors might lead to a crisp description of whether an effect will occur. However, it is unlikely that all possible factors can be known. Commonsense world understanding accepts imprecision, uncertainty and imperfect knowledge. People recognize that a complex collection of elements can cause a particular effect. The events in the complex may not be known; or, what constraints and laws the complex is subject to. Sometimes, the details underlying an event can be known to a fine level of detail, sometimes not. Usually, commonsense reasoning is more successful in reasoning about a few large-grain sized events than many fine-grained events. A satisficing solution would be to develop large-grained solutions and only use the flner- grain when the impreciseness of the large-grain is unsatisfactory.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383529","","Accidents;Association rules;Automobiles;Computational intelligence;Data mining;Glass;Humans;Laboratories;Modems;Uncertainty","","","","0","","40","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, how the parameter matrix P required in the Lyapunov equation for guaranteeing the system stability can affect the system performance is discussed. It can be found that even though the Lyapunov synthesis approach has already proven that the system is asymptotically stable, the parameter matrix P still needs to be selected appropriately besides the symmetric positive definite property. In our simulations, it can also be found that this kind of controller does not converge to a fixed controller, but adaptively adjusts its parameters according to the errors. As a consequence, when the considered system has a sensory noise, the system may gradually become unstable.

An effective hybrid approach, which has parallel modular structure of auto-regressive and neuro-fuzzy inference system, is proposed to identify cardiovascular linear mechanism of heart function and non-linear autonomic nervous regulation functions respectively. Auto-regressive is an efficient method to identify the stationary time series. Fuzzy set theory is very suitable to systems with uncertainties and expert knowledge. Neuro-fuzzy inference paradigm imports the auto-learning property into fuzzy logic engine, therefore extracts some knowledge from data automatically. Properties of this novel approach are evaluated based on three subjects' clinic data in term of accuracy, robustness, physiological meaning, and potential implementation in clinical problems.

Then, inspired by the SVD method of two-view problem, and observing the similarity of our problem to two-view problem, we prove that, in order to uniquely determine homography matrix, a 4-dimensional mid-parameter vector can be optimally estimated from the data transformed by the corresponding left singular matrix of SVD analysis of the fundamental matrix. At last, the intrinsic parameter matrix, the 3-D motion as well as the 3-D reconstruction can be straightforward calculated. So, a new algorithm to self-calibrate the intrinsic parameter matrix of a camera and to reconstruct the 3-D shape of the target in the single-view is successfully developed. The experiment has demonstrated that its performance is fairly satisfactory.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384556","","Calibration;Computer vision;Digital cameras;Image reconstruction;Image restoration;Layout;Length measurement;Partial response channels;Shape;Three dimensional displays","calibration;cameras;computer vision;image reconstruction;singular value decomposition;vectors","3D reconstruction;SVD analysis;camera self calibration;epipolar constraints;fundamental matrix;homography matrix;intrinsic parameter matrix;model based single view problems;parameter vectors;singular matrix","","1","","11","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Encryption invalidates content analysis techniques, while traffic analysis can solve the problem by concentrating on the nature and behavior of traffic. Based on the structural-stable but content-mutable properties of Website, a method combining machine learning algorithm and traffic analysis technique is proposed for encrypted Website recognition. Session describing vector, composed of connection count and data volumes transferred in each connection, is introduced to characterize a Web surfing flow, and through vector normalization, generalization and ranking, the sequence, length and dimension weight are adjusted to improve the recognition effect. The recognition process can be considered as a binary classification problem, thus SVM (support vector machine) algorithm is adopted because of its excellent performance in pattern classification problems. Experiments show that the proposed method can discern the vectors of a specific Website from others clearly, and the process of generalization and ranking are of great help to classification.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378294","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378294","","Character recognition;Cryptography;Fingerprint recognition;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Risk management;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","Web sites;cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","Web surfing flow;Website recognition process;binary classification problem;machine learning algorithm;pattern classification;support vector machine;traffic analysis;vector normalization","","1","","9","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OFFSS (optimal fuzzy-valued feature subset selection) is a new feature selection method that selects an optimal feature subset by considering both the overall overlapping degree between two classes of examples and the size of feature subset. In comparison with other methods such as OFEI, FQI and MIFS, OFFSS has no significant difference in training accuracy of the selected feature subset but has much less computational complexity. Since, the OFFSS algorithm is dependent of a similarity measure so that different similarity measures may lead to different feature subsets to be selected. We study the impact of numerical results of similarity measures on the results of OFFSS for the same dataset. Based on triangle membership functions, we demonstrate the relationship among threshold, feature subset, and classification accuracy that are produced by OFFSS using three classes of similarity measures respectively. Then one similarity measure is found for selecting less number of features.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382082","","Computer science;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy sets;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematics;Samarium","computational complexity;data mining;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification","classification accuracy;computational complexity;data mining;feature subset selection method;optimal fuzzy valued subset selection;pattern recognition;similarity measures;triangle membership functions","","0","","7","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20050131","2004","","","73","80","A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a probabilistic model that has been widely applied to a number of fields since its inception over 30 years ago. Computational Biology, Speech Recognition, and Image Processing are but a few of the application areas of HMMs. We propose an efficient algorithm for learning the parameters of a first order HMM from a state distribution (SD) oracle. The SD oracle provides the learner with the state distribution vector corresponding to a query string in the model. The SD oracle is shown to be necessary for polynomial-time learning in the sense that the consistency problem involving learning HMM parameters from a training set of state distribution vectors without the ability to query the SD oracle, is NP-complete. The learning algorithm proposed is based on an algorithm described by Tzeng for learning Probabilistic Automata.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383496","","Biological system modeling;Computational biology;Computer science;Hidden Markov models;Learning automata;Predictive models;Sequences;Speech processing;Speech recognition;Supervised learning","","","","0","","13","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The features that contain the informative attributes of the images are computed from the energy content of so obtained clusters. Images are classified based on these feature vectors. The experimental results have shown that the proposed cluster-based feature extraction method is able to effectively extract important intrinsic information content of the test images, and increase the overall classification accuracy as compared to conventional feature extraction methods.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383499","","Data mining;Discrete wavelet transforms;Feature extraction;Filters;Frequency;Image processing;Industrial engineering;Pattern recognition;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet coefficients","","","","1","","21","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
