In fully decentralized systems it is needed to allow the agents to coordinate their actions to achieve certain goals. When the agents have no means to coordinate their actions, they generally choose actions that minimize their chance of losses. If the agents were allowed to coordinate, on the other hand, they can choose actions that allow them to get higher rewards instead. In game theory, these concepts are known as risk dominance and payoff dominance. In this paper, we model communication between agents in stochastic games as an extensive form game in which the agents can numerically evaluate the benefit of communicating a piece of information to the other agents. This allows the agent to answer two important questions about the communication process, namely when should an agent communicate, and what should an agent communicate. We also present a more stable way to select between Nash equilibria in multiagent reinforcement learning using NashQ which is used in the calculation of the values for the communication game.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406651","Communication;Equilibrium Selection;Game Theory;Multiagent System;Risk Dominance","Games;Markov processes;Multiagent systems;Nash equilibrium;Safety","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;multivariable systems;stochastic games","Nash equilibria;NashQ;agent coordination;communication game;decentralized systems;game theory;multiagent reinforcement learning;multiagent system communication;payoff dominance;risk dominance;stochastic games","","0","","11","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Sampling-Based Approach to Reducing the Complexity of Continuous State Space POMDPs by Decomposition Into Coupled Perceptual and Decision Processes","R. Fakoor; M. Huber","Comput. Sci. &amp; Eng. Dept., Univ. of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA","2012 11th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","20130110","2012","1","","687","692","In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the complexity of solving POMDPs in continuous state spaces by decomposing them into separate, coupled perceptual and decision processes which leads to a reduction of the state space size of the decision learning problem. In our method, we reduce the state space of the POMDP by handling some aspects of the state space outside of the decision POMDP. To achieve this, the whole problem state space is decomposed into separate state spaces for the decision and perceptual process. The Perceptual process just serves to estimate aspects of the belief state while the decision process estimates the remainder and determines a policy. As a result, the decision process is modeled as a reduced state space POMDP. To allow the application of this method to continuous state spaces, the decision and the perceptual processes are here both handled by a sampling method within which this separation makes it possible to represent the POMDP with a smaller state space which leads to smaller sample sets for the decision POMDP and as a result to reduced representational and decision learning complexity. The goal here is to focus decision learning on the aspects of the space that are important for decision making while the observations and attributes that are important for estimating the state of the decision process are handled separately by the perceptual process. In this way, the separation into different processes can significantly reduce the complexity of decision learning. In the proposed framework and algorithm, Monte Carlo based sampling methods and corresponding sample set representations are used for both the perceptual and decision processes to be able to deal efficiently with continuous domains. We show analytically and experimentally how much the complexity of solving a POMDP can be reduced to increase the range of decision learning tasks that can be addressed.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406649","Decision Process;POMDP;Particle Filter;Perceptual Process;Reinforcement Learning;Sampling","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Complexity theory;Monte Carlo methods;Piecewise linear approximation;Robot sensing systems","Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sampling methods","Monte Carlo based sampling method;POMDP;belief state;complexity reduction;continuous state space;coupled perceptual process;decision learning complexity;decision learning problem;partially observable Markov decision process;sample set representation;sampling-based approach","","0","","11","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach is based on a downdating technique of least squares solutions for unlearning old data. This technique is evaluated on handwritten gesture recognition tasks. In particular, it is shown that this downdating techniques allow to adapt to concept drifts and that we face a precision reactiveness trade-off.

This paper proposes an on-line filter that examines the stream of incoming SIP messages and classifies them as good or bad. The classification is carried out in two stages: first a lexical analysis is performed to weed out those messages that do not belong to the language generated by the grammar defined by the SIP standard. After this first stage, a second filtering occurs which identifies messages that somehow differ - in structure or contents - from messages that were previously classified as good. While the first filter stage is straightforward, as the classification is crisp (either a messages belongs to the language or it does not), the second stage requires a more delicate handling, as it is not a sharp decision whether a message is semantically meaningful or not. The approach we followed for this step is based on using past experience on previously classified messages, i.e. a ""learn-by-example"" approach, which led to a classifier based on Support-Vector-Machines (SVM) to perform the required analysis of each incoming SIP message. The paper describes the overall architecture of the two-stage filter and then explores several points of the configuration-space for the SVM to determine a good configuration setting that will perform well when used to classify a large sample of SIP messages obtained from real traffic collected on a VoIP installation at our institution. Finally, the performance of the classification on additional messages collected from the same source is presented.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406630","Session Initiation Protocol;Support Vector Machines;VoIP","Accuracy;Kernel;Polynomials;Protocols;Servers;Support vector machines;Syntactics","Internet telephony;filtering theory;learning by example;multimedia communication;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication security;transport protocols","IP telephony;Internet;SIP messages;SVM;TCP-IP networks;VoIP installation;anomaly detection;learn-by-example approach;lexical analysis;multimedia communications;online filter;session initiation protocol;support-vector-machines;two-stage filter;voice communications;voice-over-IP","","2","","19","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Author has developed this technique for classification problems with unstable feature relevance and SEER Cancer Data illustrates this machine learning concept. BDP is applied for survival analysis in order to find groups of patients with different key factors that determine survival time. BDP operates by weights assigned to instance-feature tuples. A measure of class separability is used as a criterion in finding weights. Weights are then used within clustering in order to find clusters (subgroups of patients) with associated feature importance profiles (scored survival factors). Component models of an ensemble are built after agglomerative merging of subgroups. Because different clustering techniques typically yield different results, accuracy of an ensemble is used to establish final groups. Factors of survival time that are crucial in different situations define survival groups according to a dissimilarity principle.

The statistical significance of the results are assessed within the context of the debate currently surrounding campaign finance reform.

One of the objectives of the paper is to demonstrate how such a language would be beneficial to protein researchers to obtain in-depth protein data from a relational database without extensive SQL knowledge. The language features options such as limiting query results by key protein characteristics such as methyl donated hydrogen bond interactions, minimum and maximum phi and psi angles, repulsive forces, CH/Pi calculations, and other pertinent factors. A backend data model was designed to support storage and retrieval of protein primary and secondary sequences, atomic-level data, as well as calculations on said data. A relational DBMS is used as the persistent storage backend, with every effort made to ensure transparent portability to most relational database systems. In addition, front end applications can be developed to support retrieving, transforming, and preprocessing of information from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) into the backend data repository. The new language and associated architecture allow users to load additional protein files from RCSB into the database, issue standard queries to download pertinent data in user-friendly formats including CSV files, issue non-standard queries against secondary structures via the protein query language, and run error-detection routines against data in the database.

This is due to the increasing number of vehicles and the high dynamics of the traffic network. Ordinary methods for traffic light control cause high rate of accidents, waste in time, and affect the environment negatively due to the high rates of fuel consumption. In this paper, we develop an enhanced version of our multiagent multi-objective traffic light control system that is based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach. As a testbed framework for our traffic light controller, we use the open source Green Light District (GLD) vehicle traffic simulator. We analyze and fix some implementation problems in GLD that emerged when applying a more realistic continuous time acceleration model. We propose a new cooperation method between the neighboring traffic light agent controllers using specific learning and exploration rates. Our enhanced traffic light controller minimizes the trip time in major arteries and increases safety in residential areas. In addition, our traffic light controller satisfies green waves for platoons traveling in major arteries and considers as well the traffic environmental impact by keeping the vehicles speeds within the desirable thresholds for lowest fuel consumption.

We focus on the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) discretization method coupled with the bag-of-patterns (BoP) representation because of their state-of-the-art performance in the single representation/classifier case. Experiments with a number of standard benchmark time series datasets and a new dataset of vital signs collected from patients suffering from traumatic brain injury demonstrate the power of the ensemble approaches.

When modeling new samples with a learned dictionary, tuned to the input data containing normal fabric structural features, abnormal or defective samples are likely to have larger dissimilarity than normal samples.

In this paper, we present the partially RBF (pRBF) kernels, our original framework for the incorporation of prior-knowledge about correlation patterns between specific features and the output label. pRBF kernels are based upon the tensor-product combination of the standard radial basis function (RBF) kernel with more specialized kernels and provide a natural way for the incorporation of a commonly available type of prior-knowledge. In addition to a theoretical validation of our framework, we propose an detailed empirical evaluation on real-life biological data which illustrates its ease-of-use and effectiveness. Not only pRBF kernels were able to improve the learning results in general but they also proved to perform particularly well when the training data set was very small or strongly biased, significantly broadening the field of application of SVMs.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406605","RBF;kernel tensor product;prior knowledge;support vector methods","Correlation;Kernel;Labeling;Standards;Support vector machines;Tensile stress;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks;support vector machines","SVM;broad domain knowledge;inadequate training data;learning;pRBF kernels;support vector methods;task-specific properties","","0","","8","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we explore techniques to apply data mining towards the goal of identifying those who score in the top 1.4% of a well-known psychopathy metric using information available from their Twitter accounts. We apply a newly-proposed form of ensemble learning, Select RUSBoost (which adds feature selection to our earlier imbalance-aware ensemble in order to resolve high dimensionality), employ four classification learners, and use four feature selection techniques. The results show that when using the optimal choices of techniques, we are able to achieve an AUC value of 0.736. Furthermore, these results were only achieved when using the Select RUSBoost technique, demonstrating the importance of feature selection, data sampling, and ensemble learning.

In fact, encoding techniques play a primary role in the process of tuning a classifier/predictor, as choosing the most appropriate encoder may greatly affect its performance. As of now, evaluating the impact of an encoding technique on a classification system typically requires to train the system and test it by means of a performance metric deemed relevant (e.g., precision, recall, and Matthews correlation coefficients). For this reason, assessing a single encoding technique is a time consuming activity, which introduces some additional degrees of freedom (e.g., parameters of the training algorithm) that may be uncorrelated with the encoding technique to be assessed. In this paper, we propose a family of methods to measure the performance of encoding techniques used in classification tasks, based on the correlation between encoded input data and the corresponding output. The proposed approach provides correlation-based metrics, devised with the primary goal of focusing on the encoding technique, leading other unrelated aspects apart. Notably, the proposed technique allows to save computational time to a great extent, as it needs only a tiny fraction of the time required by standard methods.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406639","classification;correlation;encoding techniques;metrics;performance;prediction;supervised learning","Correlation;Encoding;Measurement;Proteins;Random variables;Standards;Vectors","correlation theory;encoding;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern classification","classification system;classifier-predictor tuning;correlation-based metrics;encoding technique assessment;learning algorithm;performance metric;protein secondary structure prediction","","0","","9","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Techniques such as feature selection have been known to not only improve computation time, but to improve the results of experiments by removing the redundant and irrelevant features or genes from consideration in subsequent analysis. Univariate feature selection techniques in particular are well suited for the large levels of high dimensionality that are inherent in bioinformatics datasets (for example: DNA microarray datasets) due to their intuitive output (a ranked lists of features or genes) and their relatively small computational time compared to other techniques. This paper presents seven univariate feature selection techniques and collects them into a single family entitled First Order Statistics (FOS) based feature selection. These seven all share the trait of using first order statistical measures such as mean and standard deviation, although this is the first work to relate them to one another and consider their performance compared with one another. In order to examine the properties of these seven techniques we performed a series of similarity and classification experiments on eleven DNA microarray datasets. Our results show that in general, each feature selection technique will create diverse feature subsets when compared to the other members of the family. However when we look at classification we find that, with one exception, the techniques will produce good classification results and that the techniques will have similar performances to each other. Our recommendation, is to use the rankers Signal-to-Noise and SAM for the best classification results and to avoid Fold Change Ratio as it is consistently the worst performer of the seven rankers.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406743","Classification;DNA Microarray;Feature Selection","Bioinformatics;DNA;Logistics;Measurement;Standards;Support vector machines;Vegetation","bioinformatics;statistical analysis","DNA microarray datasets;FOS based feature selection;SAM;bioinformatics datasets;dimensionality reduction techniques;first order statistical measures;first order statistics based feature selection;fold change ratio;mean deviation;signal-to-noise;standard deviation;subsequent analysis;univariate feature selection techniques","","18","","16","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The question of interest is whether repairs reduce the incidence of future events that cause service disruptions ranging from minor to serious ones. A key challenge in defining treatment and control groups in the absence of a randomized experiment involved an inherent bias in selection of electrical structures to be inspected in a given year. To compensate for the bias, we construct separate models for each year of the propensity for a structure to have an inspection repair. The propensity models account for differences across years in the structures that get inspected. To model the treatment outcome, we use a statistical approach based on the additive effects of many weak learners. Our results indicate that inspection repairs are more beneficial earlier in the five-year inspection cycle, which accords with the inherent bias to inspect structures in earlier years that are known to have problems.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406787","Bayesian Additive Regression Trees;causal inference;propensity modeling;secondary electrical grid","Cable insulation;Convergence;Inspection;Logistics;Maintenance engineering;Power cables;Regression tree analysis","inspection;maintenance engineering;power grids;statistical analysis","New York City Electrical Grid;five-year inspection cycle;inspection repair program;multivariate assessment;secondary electrical grid;service disruptions;statistical approach","","0","","19","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since most pair of documents usually shares just a small percentage of words, the dataset representation tends to become very sparse, thus the need of using a similarity metric capable of a partial matching of a set of features. The technique known as Co-Clustering is capable of finding several clusters inside a dataset with each cluster composed of just a subset of the object and feature sets. In word-document data this can be useful to identify the clusters of documents pertaining to the same topic, even though they share just a small fraction of words.

Because of the high dimension of Raman spectra and limited number of samples, latent variable regression methods, e.g. principal component regression (PCR), reduced-rank regression (RRR) and partial least squares (PLS), are commonly used. According to different criteria, these methods tend to seek different latent variables of the spectra data. For PCR and RRR, the latent variables tend to best represent the Raman spectra and best predict the concentrations. PLS balances the two criteria with an equal weight. We design a new continuum regression (NCR) method that uses a weight parameter α to control the portion of each criterion in the objective function, and embraces RRR (α = 0), PLS2 (α = 1) and PCR (α = ∞) as its special cases.

Active contours have been used for bladder wall segmentation, which can be broadly divided into gradient-based and region-based methods, according to the used image features. However, the artifacts in MR images and the complex background outside the bladder lead to significant challenges for segmentation. In this paper, a coupled directional level set model is proposed to segment the outer and inner boundaries simultaneously by exploiting the directional gradient, region information and thickness prior of the bladder wall. With our proposed method, the influence of the artifacts in the bladder lumen and the complicated intensity distribution of soft tissues surrounding the bladder can be appreciably reduced.

However, not all metrics are relevant to the class attribute (software quality). Metric (feature) selection has become the cornerstone of many software quality classification problems. Selecting software metrics that are important for software quality classification is a necessary and critical step before the model training process. Recently, the robustness (e.g., stability) of feature selection techniques has been studied, to examine the sensitivity of these techniques to changes (adding/removing program modules to/from their dataset). This work provides an empirical study regarding the stability of feature selection techniques across six software metrics datasets with varying levels of class balance. In this work eighteen feature selection techniques are evaluated. Moreover, three factors, feature subset size, degree of perturbation, and class balance of datasets, are considered in this study to evaluate stability of feature selection techniques. Experimental results show that these factors affect the stability of feature selection techniques as one might expect. We found that with few exceptions, feature ranking based on highly imbalanced datasets are less stable than based on slightly imbalanced data. Results also show that making smaller changes to the datasets has less impact on the stability of feature ranking techniques. Overall, we conclude that a careful understanding of one's dataset (and certain choices of metric selection technique) can help practitioners build more reliable software quality models.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406682","feature ranking;imbalanced data;stability;subsample","Indexes;Measurement;Radio frequency;Software quality;Stability criteria","pattern classification;software metrics;software quality","feature ranking;feature selection stability;imbalanced software engineering data;model training process;software development cycle;software metrics;software quality classification problems;software quality modeling","","0","","18","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moving object detection in aerial video is still a challenging problem for the reason that when capturing the video the camera (or the platform) is moving all the time. As a result, the problem is detecting moving object from moving background which is much more difficult than the case that the background is constant. To this end, a novel approach is proposed in this paper. Moving object detection in stationary scene usually modeling the pixel value changes over time, but in aerial video the change does not have regular patterns. Therefore, we model the motion of the background rather than modeling the background directly. The optical flow between every two adjacent frames is computed first to get the motion information for each pixel. Based on this, we define a notion named ``pixel motion process"" which means the motion changes (the optical flow value changes) of a particular pixel over time, and transfer the Gaussian mixture model framework used for modeling background in the stationary scene to model the background motion. The result is an accurate, adaptive and general background motion model which is used to detect foreground moving objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406776","Aerial video;Gaussian Mixture Model;Moving object detection;Optical flow","Adaptation models;Cameras;Computational modeling;Computer vision;Mathematical model;Object detection;Optical imaging","Gaussian processes;image motion analysis;image sequences;object detection;video cameras;video signal processing","Gaussian mixture model framework;adjacent frames;aerial video;foreground moving object detection;general background motion model;motion information;moving background detection;optical flow;pixel motion process;stationary scene;video camera","","5","","12","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Active learning is a key technique to reduce human-labeling burden by exploring an optimal subset from unlabeled data. In this paper we use a batch mode incremental and active learning framework to construct scene classification models. In traditional batch examples selection methods, there often exists redundancy information between these top informative examples. To alleviate the impact of redundancy, we employ two effective batch selection strategies which one is called multi-pool based BvSB and the other is called K-centroid cluster BvSB, experimental results with widely used 15 scene and UIUC-sports datasets demonstrated that our scheme can get better results than that only using BvSB measurement which does not considering redundancy. In order to improve efficiency, batch mode incremental support vector machines are employed. With the incremental learning scheme, the training process of active learning is much more efficient than that using all the selected examples to retrain the classification models in each round.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406578","active learning;incremental learning;scene classification;support vector machines","Accuracy;Learning systems;Machine learning;Redundancy;Support vector machines;Training;Uncertainty","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","UIUC-sports datasets;active learning;automatic personal digital photograph organization;human-labeling burden;incremental learning;incremental support vector machines;k-centroid cluster BvSB;labor-intensive task;multipool based BvSB;robot visual guidance;robust classifiers;scene classification","","5","","28","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classifiers differ in the way they combine the values of the variables available for each subject. Frequently the classifiers are developed using class-imbalanced data, where the number of samples in each class is not equal. Standard classification methods used on class-imbalanced data are often biased towards the majority class: they classify most new samples in the majority class and they do not accurately predict the minority class. Data are high-dimensional when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of subjects. In this paper we show how the high-dimensionality poses additional challenges when dealing with class-imbalanced prediction.

Based on the category, we classify music songs using lyrics. In order to extend the semantic information of lyrics, we apply CLOPE to cluster lyrics and use the centroid of the corresponding cluster to represent the lyrics.

This paper considers and empirically evaluates a decision-level data fusion method for enabling reliable ocean turbine state detection based on data from multiple sensors. This method involves first generating a classification model from the data from individual sensor channels. For each new incoming instance, the probability that this new instance belongs to each of the possible system states is then computed individually based on observations made by each source. These probabilities are averaged and the system state with the highest probability is selected as the fused output. In a case study presented in this paper, six accelerometers mounted at different positions along a dynamometer test bed for an ocean turbine measure the vibration of various components while the machine is in operation. Each sensor gives unique information about the dynamometer thus ignoring data from one or more sources (or sensors) means possibly discarding useful information. We apply the decision-level fusion method to combine the decisions made from the individual channels and allow for more informed state detection which considers all sources together. Five popular machine learning algorithms are used to generate the classification models from the individual sensor data to see how the performances of each algorithm is affected by fusion and to determine whether this decision level fusion approach can lead to optimal behavior for an ocean turbine state detection module. All five learners are found to benefit from such an approach. Of all the learners, the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm produces the best results after fusion.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406791","decision level fusion;ocean turbine;sensor fusion;state detection","Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Oceans;Sensors;Turbines;Vibrations","dynamometers;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor fusion;turbines;vibration measurement;wavelet transforms","accelerometers;classification model;decision-level data fusion;dynamometer test bed;informed state detection;k-nearest neighbors;machine learning;multiple sensors;ocean turbine state detection;optimal behavior;probability;sensor channels;vibration measurement;wavelet features","","0","","22","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, we describe our efforts to develop a pattern recognition workflow to automatically detect snow avalanche events from passive seismic data. Our initial workflow consisted of frequency domain feature extraction, cluster-based stratified subsampling, and 100 runs of training and testing of 12 different classification algorithms. When tested on the entire season of data from a single sensor, all twelve machine learning algorithms resulted in mean classification accuracies above 84%, with seven classifiers reaching over 90%. We then experimented with a voting based paradigm that combined information from all seven sensors. This method increased overall accuracy and precision, but performed quite poorly in terms of classifier recall. We, therefore, decided to pursue other signal preprocessing methodologies. We focused our efforts on improving the overall performance of single sensor avalanche detection, and employed spectral flux based event selection to identify events with significant instantaneous increases in spectral energy. With a threshold of 90% relative spectral flux increase, we correctly selected 32 of 33 slab avalanches and reduced our problem space by nearly 98%. When trained and tested on this reduced data set of only significant events, a decision stump classifier achieved 93% overall accuracy, 89.5% recall, and improved the precision of our initial workflow from 2.8% to 13.2%.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406582","automated;avalanche;detection;machine learning;seismic","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Frequency domain analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Snow;Testing;Training","feature extraction;frequency-domain analysis;geophysical image processing;image sampling;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;seismology;sensors;spectral analysis","automatic avalanche event detection;cluster-based stratified subsampling;feature extraction;frequency domain analysis;geophone sensor;image classification algorithm;machine learning algorithm;passive seismic data;pattern recognition workflow;sensor avalanche detection;signal preprocessing;spectral energy;spectral flux;voting based paradigm","","4","","22","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a sparse, smooth regularized regression model to infer the volatility of the data while explicitly accounting for dependencies between different companies. Using real stock market data, we construct dynamic time varying graphs for different sectors of companies to further analyze how the volatility dependency between companies within sectors vary over time.

"SVM-based Framework for the Robust Extraction of Objects from Histopathological Images Using Color, Texture, Scale and Geometry","A. Veillard; S. Bressan; D. Racoceanu","Sch. of Comput., Nat.

To your best knowledge, although some existing solutions perform adequately with relatively predictable low-grade cancers, solutions for the problematic high-grade cancers have yet to be proposed. In this paper, we propose a method for the extraction of cell nuclei from H&E stained biopsies robust enough to deal with the full range of histological grades observed in daily clinical practice. The robustness is achieved by combining a wide range of information including color, texture, scale and geometry in a multi-stage, Support Vector Machine (SVM) based framework to replace the original image with a new, probabilistic image modality with stable characteristics. The actual extraction of the nuclei is performed from the new image using Mark Point Processes (MPP), a state-of-the-art stochastic method. An empirical evaluation on clinical data provided and annotated by pathologists shows that our method greatly improves detection and extraction results, and provides a reliable solution with high grade cancers. Moreover, our method based on machine learning can easily adapt to specific clinical conditions. In many respects, our method contributes to bridging the gap between the computer vision technologies and their actual clinical use for breast cancer grading.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406591","breast cancer grading;computer vision;digital histopathology;marked point process;object detection and extraction;support vector machine","Breast cancer;Hospitals;Image color analysis;Kernel;Shape;Support vector machines","cancer;computer vision;image colour analysis;image texture;medical image processing;probability;stochastic processes;support vector machines;tumours","SVM;breast cancer grading;cell nuclei extraction;color;computer vision;eosin stained biopsies;geometry;haematoxylin stained biopsies;high-grade cancer;high-grade tumor;histological grade;histopathological image;low-grade cancer;machine learning;malignant tumor;mark point process;object extraction;probabilistic image modality;scale;stochastic method;support vector machine;texture","","2","","13","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Predicting Dark Triad Personality Traits from Twitter Usage and a Linguistic Analysis of Tweets","C. Sumner; A. Byers; R. Boochever; G. J.

There are a growing number of research papers related to social media, a small number of which focus on personality prediction. To date, studies have typically focused on the Big Five traits of personality, but one area which is relatively unexplored is that of the anti-social traits of narcissism, Machiavellians and psychopathy, commonly referred to as the Dark Triad. This study explored the extent to which it is possible to determine anti-social personality traits based on Twitter use. This was performed by comparing the Dark Triad and Big Five personality traits of 2,927 Twitter users with their profile attributes and use of language. Analysis shows that there are some statistically significant relationships between these variables. Through the use of crowd sourced machine learning algorithms, we show that machine learning provides useful prediction rates, but is imperfect in predicting an individual's Dark Triad traits from Twitter activity. While predictive models may be unsuitable for predicting an individual's personality, they may still be of practical importance when models are applied to large groups of people, such as gaining the ability to see whether anti-social traits are increasing or decreasing over a population. Our results raise important questions related to the unregulated use of social media analysis for screening purposes. It is important that the practical and ethical implications of drawing conclusions about personal information embedded in social media sites are better understood.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406767","Dark Triad;Personality;Social Networks;Twitter","Machine learning;Media;Observers;Pragmatics;Predictive models;Twitter","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia computing;natural language processing;social networking (online)","Internet;Tweets;Twitter usage;linguistic analysis;machine learning algorithms;online behaviour;personality prediction;predicting dark triad personality traits;social media sites;social scientists","","32","","39","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In ODC the output variable has a natural order; however, there is not a precise notion of the distance between classes. The recently proposed method for ordinal data, Kernel Discriminant Learning Ordinal Regression (KDLOR), is based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), a simple tool for classification. KDLOR brings LDA to the forefront in the ODC held, motivating further research. This paper compares three LDA based algorithms for ODC. The first method uses the generic framework of Frank and Hall for ODC instantiated with a kernel version of LDA. Similarly, the second method is based on the also generic Data Replication framework for ODC instantiated with the same kernel version of LDA. Both the Frank and Hall and Data Replication methods address the ODC problem by the use of a base binary classifier. Finally, the third method under comparison is KDLOR. The experiments are carried out on synthetic and real datasets. A comparison between the performances of the three systems is made based on tstatistics. The performance and running time complexity of the methods do not support any advantage of KDLOR over the other two methods.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406668","Classification;Kernel Discriminant Analysis;Linear Discriminant Analysis;Ordinal Data","Adaptation models;Data models;Kernel;Machine learning;Psychology;Standards;Training","data handling;learning by example;pattern classification;regression analysis","Frank-and-Hall generic framework;KDLOR;LDA;ODC problem;base binary classifier;generic data replication framework;information retrieval;kernel discriminant analysis;kernel discriminant learning ordinal regression;learning-from-examples;linear discriminant analysis;machine learning;medicine;ordinal data classification;psychology","","3","","11","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In atlas selection methods, manifold learning based techniques have recently emerged as very promisingly. However, due to the complexity of anatomical structures in raw images, it is difficult to get accurate atlas selection results by measuring only the distance between raw images on the manifolds. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a label image constrained atlas selection (LICAS) method to exploit the shape and size information of the regions to be segmented from the label images. Constrained by the label images, a new manifold projection method is developed to help uncover the intrinsic similarity between the regions of interest across images. Compared with other existing methods, the experimental results of segmentation on 60 Magnetic Resonance (MR) images showed that the selected atlases are closer to the target structure and more accurate segmentation can be obtained by using the proposed method.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.232","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406681","Atlas selection;Image segmentation;Label image constrained","Anatomical structure;Image segmentation;Linear programming;Machine learning;Manifolds;Shape;Symmetric matrices","biomedical MRI;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","LICAS method;distance measurement;image segmentation;intrinsic similarity;label image constrained atlas selection;label image constraint;magnetic resonance image;manifold learning;manifold projection method;multiatlas based image selection;raw image","","2","","10","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been shown to be very effective, but have been difficult to scale to large-data problems. Some approaches have sought to scale SVM training by approximating and parallelizing the underlying quadratic optimization problem. This paper pursues a different approach. Our algorithm, which we call Sampled SVM, uses an existing SVM training algorithm to create a new SVM training algorithm. It uses randomized data sampling to better extend SVMs to large data applications. Experiments on several datasets show that our method is faster than and comparably accurate to both the original SVM algorithm it is based on and the Cascade SVM, the leading data organization approach for SVMs in the literature.

The proposed method handles problems that arise in large scale urban environments due to acquisition conditions (static and dynamic objects/pedestrians) combined with the continuous acquisition of data along the vehicle's direction, the varying light conditions and strong occlusions (due to the presence of trees, traffic signs, cars, etc.) giving rise to high intra-class variability.

Central to this class of techniques is the construction of an accurate formal model for the system being investigated. Unfortunately, manual construction of such models can be a resource demanding process, and this shortcoming has motivated the development of algorithms for automatically learning system models from observed system behaviors. Recently, algorithms have been proposed for learning Markov decision process representations of reactive systems based on alternating sequences of input/output observations. While alleviating the problem of manually constructing a system model, the collection/generation of observed system behaviors can also prove demanding. Consequently we seek to minimize the amount of data required. In this paper we propose an algorithm for learning deterministic Markov decision processes from data by actively guiding the selection of input actions. The algorithm is empirically analyzed by learning system models of slot machines, and it is demonstrated that the proposed active learning procedure can significantly reduce the amount of data required to obtain accurate system models.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406711","Active learning;Markov decision processes;statistical learning;verification","Analytical models;Data models;Machine learning;Markov processes;Pipelines;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty","Markov processes;formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov decision process representation learning;Markov decision processes;active learning;automatically learning system models;deterministic Markov decision process learning;formal model verification;observed system behaviors;slot machine system models;system property validation;system verification","","4","","19","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The Effect of Number of Iterations on Ensemble Gene Selection","W. Awada; T. M. Khoshgoftaar; D. Dittman; R.

The degree of dimensionality is reduced by identifying and removing redundant and irrelevant features or genes and leaving only an optimum subset of features for subsequent analysis. However, a number of feature selection techniques show poor stability (resistance to change in the underlying data). One approach for increasing the stability of feature subsets is ensemble feature selection. This is performed first by generating multiple ranked gene lists and then aggregating the results using an aggregation function. While research has been performed on ensemble feature selection and its effect on gene list stability, there has been little research on an important choice made in the process of ensemble feature selection: the number of iterations (or repetitions) of feature selection. The computation time of ensemble feature selection is greatly affected by the number of ranked lists generated: the higher the number of iterations, the more computation time is required. To study this, we evaluate the similarity among feature subsets generated from two different approaches to ensemble feature selection (data diversity and hybrid approach). We calculate the similarity between the final ranked lists generated using 10, 20 and 50 iterations, using the mean aggregation function. Our results show that the similarity between 20 and 50 iterations is high enough for us to recommend using 20 iterations instead of 50 and thus saving the large amount of computation time required for 50 iterations.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406750","Classification;DNA Microarray;Ensemble Feature Selection","Bioinformatics;Cancer;DNA;Hybrid power systems;Indexes;Machine learning;Stability analysis","bioinformatics;genetics;iterative methods","DNA microarray datasets;bioinformatics datasets;dimensionality-reducing techniques;ensemble gene selection;iterations;multiple ranked gene lists;stability;subsequent analysis","","2","","17","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Drawing inspiration from the Elman recurrent neural network, we introduce a winner-take-all based recurrent clustering algorithm that is able to identify temporal regularities in an unsupervised manner. We explore the potential pitfalls that result from adding feedback to an incremental clustering algorithm and apply the proposed technique to several time series inference problems in the context of semi-supervised learning.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach based on a hierarchical, multilevel control techniques. The approach is designed to provide sensor measurement validation, associates a degree of integrity with each measurement, identifies faulty sensors, and estimates the actual system states and sensor values in spite of faulty measurements. Using Virtual Machine Model concept, the method is achieved in three steps: state prediction, fault detection & sensor measurement and system online update or correction. A combination of flexible least square algorithm and adaptive Kalman filtering method are implemented to learn and predict system behavior. The experimental results show that the proposed model and algorithms can efficiently identify faulty components, reduce noise errors injected by sensors/system and thus providing self healing.

The standard supervised learning method for HMM is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which maximizes the joint probability of training data. However, the most natural way of training would be finding the parameters that directly minimize the error rate of a given training set. In this article, we propose a novel learning method that minimizes the number of incorrectly decoded labels frame-wise. To do this, we construct a smooth function that is arbitrarily close to the exact frame error rate and minimize it directly using a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The proposed approach is intuitive and simple. We applied our method to the task of chord recognition in music, and the results show that it performs better than Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Minimum Classification Error.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406763","HMM;MFE;MLE;chord recognition;machine learning","Approximation methods;Decoding;Error analysis;Hidden Markov models;Maximum likelihood estimation;Training;Training data","audio signal processing;gradient methods;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation;music;optimisation;probability","HMM;chord recognition;gradient-based optimization algorithm;hidden Markov model training;maximum likelihood estimation;minimum classification error;minimum frame error criterion;music;supervised learning method;training data joint probability;training set","","1","","18","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Class imbalance is ubiquitous in Machine Learning, Data Mining and Pattern Recognition applications; therefore, these research communities have responded to such interest with literally dozens of methods and techniques. Surprisingly, there are still many fundamental open-ended questions such as ""Are all learning paradigms equally affected by class imbalance?"", ""What is the expected performance loss for different imbalance degrees?"" and ""How much of the performance losses can be recovered by the treatment methods?"". In this paper, we propose a simple experimental design to assess the performance of class imbalance treatment methods. This experimental setup uses real data sets with artificially modified class distributions to evaluate classifiers in a wide range of class imbalance. We employ such experimental design in a large-scale experimental evaluation with twenty-two data sets and seven learning algorithms from different paradigms. Our results indicate that the expected performance loss, as a percentage of the performance obtained with the balanced distribution, is quite modest (below 5%) for the most balanced distributions up to 10% of minority examples. However, the loss tends to increase quickly for higher degrees of class imbalance, reaching 20% for 1% of minority class examples. Support Vector Machine is the classifier paradigm that is less affected by class imbalance, being almost insensitive to all but the most imbalanced distributions. Finally, we show that the sampling algorithms only partially recover the performance losses. On average, typically about 30% or less of the performance that was lost due to class imbalance was recovered by random over-sampling and SMOTE.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406734","Class imbalance;experimental setup;sampling methods","Handwriting recognition;Learning systems;Loss measurement;Machine learning;Sampling methods;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;support vector machines","SMOTE;balanced distribution;class imbalance treatment method evaluation;data mining application;learning algorithms;machine learning application;pattern recognition application;random oversampling;real data sets;sampling algorithms;support vector machine","","3","","27","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It occurs when there are significantly fewer examples in one or more classes in a dataset compared to the number of instances in the remaining classes. When trained on highly imbalanced datasets, traditional machine learning techniques can often simply ignore the minority class(es) and label all instances as being of the majority class to maximize accuracy. This problem has been studied in many domains but there is little or no research related to the effect of class imbalance in fault data for condition monitoring of an ocean turbine. This study makes the first efforts in bridging that gap by providing insight into how class imbalance in vibration data can impact a learner's ability to reliably identify changes in the ocean turbine's operational state. To do so, we empirically evaluate the performances of three popular, but very different, machine learning algorithms when trained on four datasets with varying class distributions (one balanced and three imbalanced) to distinguish between a normal and an abnormal state. All data used in this study were collected from the testbed for an ocean turbine and were under sampled to simulate the different levels of imbalance. We find here, as in other domains, that the three learners seemed to suffer overall when trained on data with a highly skewed class distribution (with 0.1% examples in a faulty/abnormal state while the remaining 99.9% were captured in a normal operational state). It was noted, however, that the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers performed better when only 5% of the total number of examples were representative of an abnormal state (the remaining 95% therefore indicating normal operation) than they did when there was no imbalance present.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406674","class imbalance;condition monitoring;ocean turbine;state detection","Machine learning;Oceans;Reliability;Sensors;Training;Turbines;Vibrations","condition monitoring;decision trees;fault diagnosis;hydraulic turbines;learning (artificial intelligence);mechanical engineering computing;optimisation;pattern classification;regression analysis","class imbalance;decision tree classifiers;highly imbalanced datasets;highly skewed class distribution;learner ability;logistic regression;machine learning techniques;ocean turbine condition monitoring;ocean turbine fault data;ocean turbine operational state;performance evaluation;real world datasets;reliable state detection;vibration data","","1","","21","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among many face recognition approaches, the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) turns out to be one of the popular techniques especially for part-based learning. It aims to factorize a nonnegative data matrix into two nonnegative matrices and obtains a well approximated product using an objective function. In this paper we propose to maximize the correntropy similarity measure as an objective function for NMF. Correntropy has been recently defined as a nonlinear similarity measure using an entropy-based criterion. After the minimization process of the correntropy function, we use it to recognize occluded face data set and compare its recognition performance with the standard NMF and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The experimental results are illustrated with ORL face data set.

To handle the curse of dimensionality problem, this paper introduces subspace grids and shows how it can be employed for pattern recognition tasks efficiently. To address the cases with small sample sizes, this paper proposes a multi-scale approach where coarse scale, being stable and generic in nature, suits well for small sample sizes, and fine scales, being more specialized in nature, enhance classification accuracy. The paper first describes projection of multidimensional data to a number of lower dimensional subspaces. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) algorithms are used to define lower dimensional subspaces. The range of value associated with each vector of a subspace is divided into a number of equal parts to define coarse subspace grids. Coarse subspace grids are further divided equally into fine subspace grids. A recursive procedure is then employed to obtain rules where coarse and fine subspace grids form premises of rules. The system is tested on the bench mark IRIS data set having 150 examples. (50 examples belonging to each class type).

Specifying genotype-phenotype correlations correctly among many syndromes is labor intensive especially for very rare diseases. The use of a computer based prediagnosis system can offer effective decision support particularly when only very few previous examples exist or in a remote environment where expert knowledge is not readily accessible. In this work we develop and demonstrate that accurate classification of dysmorphic faces is feasible by image processing of two dimensional face images. We test the proposed system on real patient image data by constructing a dataset of dysmorphic faces published in scholarly journals, hence having accurate diagnostic information about the syndrome. Our statistical methodology represents facial image data in terms of principal component analysis (PCA) and a leave one out evaluation scheme to quantify accuracy. The methodology has been tested with 15 syndromes including 75 cases, 5 examples per syndrome. A diagnosis success rate of 79% has been established. It can be concluded that a great number of syndromes indicating a characteristic pattern of facial anomalies can be typically diagnosed by employing computer-assisted machine learning algorithms since a face develops under the influence of many genes, particularly the genes causing syndromes.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406745","Facial genotype-phenotype dysmorphology; diagnostic decision support systems; machine learning; PCA","Databases;Diseases;Feature extraction;Genetics;Principal component analysis;Training;Vectors","decision support systems;face recognition;genetics;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;molecular biophysics;principal component analysis","PCA;clinical diagnosis;clinical genetics;computer based prediagnosis system;computer-assisted machine learning algorithms;cyto techniques;diagnostic decision support system;dysmorphic face classification;facial anomalies;facial dysmorphology;facial features;genetic dysmorphology;genotype-phenotype correlation specification;image processing;molecular techniques;principal component analysis;real patient image data;statistical methodology;syndrome identification","","0","","9","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal is to reduce the quantity of data to be processed while maintaining or improving state detection capabilities. Five feature selection techniques (Chi-squared, Information Gain, Signal-To-Noise, AUC and PRC) are evaluated based on their effects on four widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression, when each machine learner is trained on the top n features selected by each feature selection technique. Six values of n (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 15) were considered. Features were extracted from the raw vibration signals using a Short Time Wavelet Transform with Baselining (STWTB) technique designed to allow for reliable state detection regardless of the turbine's operating conditions, which are often reflected within its vibration readings. The condition-independent features extracted by the STWTB are then fused to combine all the data observed by all sensor sources. Models were built on data gathered at one operating condition and tested against data from a different operating condition to simulate the problem of building models which work regardless of operating condition. Results show that k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression have improved classification performance when using less than 11% of the 78 available features, with Logistic Regression needing just 2 features selected by the Signal-To-Noise technique to generate a perfect classification model. The Decision Tree performed best without feature selection.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406684","Ocean turbine;condition monitoring;feature selection","Data models;Feature extraction;Oceans;Turbines;Vibrations;Wavelet transforms","Bayes methods;condition monitoring;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);mechanical engineering computing;pattern recognition;regression analysis;reliability;turbines;vibrations;wavelet transforms","STWTB;baselining;condition monitoring system;decision tree;feature selection;k-nearest neighbors;logistic regression;machine learning;naive Bayes;ocean turbine;reliability analysis;short time wavelet transform;vibration data","","0","","23","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Predicting a growth of 10MW (how much) in the south (where) of a city would lead to complete different polices in terms of resources allocation (for instance a new substation) than predicting the same amount of 10MW in the north.

However, an alternate to binary classification is one-class classification, which aims to build models using only a single class of data. This is particularly useful when there is an over-abundance of data of a particular class. In such imbalanced cases, binary classifiers may not perform very well, and one-class classifiers then become the viable option. In this paper, we are interested in investigating the performance of binary and one-class classifiers as the level of imbalance increases, and, thus, uncertainty in the second class. Our objective is to gain insight into which classification paradigm becomes more suitable as imbalance and uncertainty increase. To this end, we conduct experiments on various datasets, both artificial and from the UCI repository, and monitor the performance of the binary and one-class classifiers as the size of the second class gradually decreases, thus increasing the level of imbalance. The results show that as the level of imbalance increases, the performance of binary classifiers decreases, whereas one-class classifiers stay relatively stable.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406735","Machine learning;binary classification;imbalanced data;one-class classification","Data models;Diabetes;Diseases;Heart;Market research;Probability density function;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;uncertainty handling","UCI dataset;binary classification;imbalanced data;machine learning;one-class classification;uncertainty handling","","6","","11","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work approaches ramp-up as sequence of technical changes which aim to get a manufacturing system to a desirable performance in the fastest time. A reinforcement learning approach is proposed to support decisions during ramp-up. The aim is to capture the dynamics between an operator and the system and support time reduction of the process. A batch learning approach has been identified as promising since it matches the practical aspect of decision making during ramp-up. It is combined with a Q-learning algorithm which provides theoretical foundation of optimum convergence.

For each sample, GSS-NMF minimizes its distances to the same labeled samples and maximizes the distances against different labeled samples to incorporate the discriminative information. Since both labeled and unlabeled samples are embedded in the same reduced dimensional space, the discriminative information from the labeled samples is successfully transferred to the unlabeled samples, and thus it greatly improves the clustering performance. Since the traditional multiplicative update rule converges slowly, we applied the well-known projected gradient method to optimizing GSS-NMF and the proposed algorithm can be applied to optimizing other manifold regularized NMF efficiently. Experimental results on two popular document datasets, i.e., Reuters21578 and TDT-2, show that GSS-NMF outperforms the representative SS-NMF algorithms.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406696","manifold learning;non-negative matrix factorization;semi-supervised learning","Clustering algorithms;Gradient methods;Linear programming;Machine learning;Manifolds;Periodic structures;Semisupervised learning","approximation theory;document handling;gradient methods;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;minimisation;pattern clustering","GSS-NMF optimization;Reuters21578 document dataset;TDT-2 document dataset;dimensional space reduction;distance maximization;distance minimization;document clustering performance improvement;graph based SS-NMF;graph-based semisupervised nonnegative matrix factorization approximation;labeled samples;low-rank matrix product;manifold regularized NMF optimization;projected gradient method;unlabeled samples","","4","","26","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this paper is to identify the features which are crucial for discriminating protein essentiality and build learning machines for prediction. We first collect features from a variety of sources. Then we adopt a backward feature selection method and use the selected features to build SVM predictors. The cross validations are conducted on the originally imbalanced data set as well as the down-sampling balanced data set. The performance of these feature subsets are then subject to the statistical test to confirm their significance. For the imbalanced data set, our best values of F-measure and MCC are 0.549 and 0.495, respectively. For balanced data set, our best values of F-measure and MCC of our models are 0.770 and 0.545, respectively. The results are superior to all previous results under various performance measures.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406595","bioinformatics;essential protein;protein-protein interaction;statistical test;support vector machine","Amino acids;Data models;Feature extraction;Indexes;Machine learning;Proteins;Support vector machines","biology computing;learning (artificial intelligence);proteins;statistical analysis;support vector machines","F-measure;SVM predictors;backward feature selection method;balanced data set down-sampling;cellular life;learning machines;protein discrimination;protein essentiality prediction;statistical tests;support vector machine","","0","","24","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
