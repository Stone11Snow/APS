For each new object encountered, a conformal predictor outputs a set of class labels that contains the true label with probability at least 1 - ∈, where ∈ is a user-specified error rate. The ability to predict with confidence can be extremely useful, but in many real-world applications unambiguous predictions consisting of a single class label are preferred. Hence it is desirable to design conformal predictors to maximize the rate of singleton predictions, termed the efficiency of the predictor. In this paper we derive a novel criterion for maximizing efficiency for a certain class of conformal predictors, show how concepts from local distance metric learning can provide a useful bound for maximizing this criterion, and demonstrate efficiency gains on real-world datasets.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-1026-0; POD:978-1-4673-1024-6; USB:978-1-4673-1025-3","10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349813","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6349813","classification;conformal prediction;distance metric learning","Approximation methods;Error analysis;Machine learning;Measurement;Optimization;Standards;Support vector machines","error statistics;learning (artificial intelligence);prediction theory;probability;signal classification","classification;conformal prediction;local distance metric learning;probability;single class label;singleton prediction;user-specified error rate","","1","","13","","","23-26 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different results are obtained when different clustering methods are applied over the same dataset as well as when the same set of genes is clustered in different microarray datasets. Most approaches cluster genes' profiles from only one dataset, either by a single method or an ensemble of methods; we propose using the binarization of consensus partition matrix (Bi-CoPaM) method to analyze comprehensively the results of clustering the same set of genes by different clustering methods and from different datasets. A tunable consensus result is generated and can be tightened or widened to control the assignment of the doubtful genes that have been assigned to different clusters in different individual results. We apply this over a subset of 384 yeast genes by using four clustering methods and five microarray datasets. The results demonstrate the power of Bi-CoPaM in fusing many different individual results in a tunable consensus result and that such comprehensive analysis can overcome many of the defects in any of the individual datasets or clustering methods.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-1026-0; POD:978-1-4673-1024-6; USB:978-1-4673-1025-3","10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349787","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6349787","Ensemble clustering;consensus fuzzy partition matrix binarization;gene clustering;yeast cell-cycle","Clustering methods;Couplings;Educational institutions;Gene expression;Machine learning;Unsupervised learning","biology;data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern clustering","Bi-CoPaM;binarization of consensus partition matrix;cluster genes;comprehensive analysis;consensus partition matrix;gene expression datasets;microarray datasets;multiple microarray datasets;supervised machine learning;unsupervised machine learning","","0","","23","","","23-26 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper examines hand gestures as an alternative or supplementary input modality for mobile devices. A new gesture recognition system based on the use of acceleration sensor, that is nowadays being featured in a growing number of consumer electronic devices, is presented. Accelerometer sensor readings can be used for detection of hand movements and their classification into previously trained gestures. The proposed system utilizes Mahalanobis distance metric learning to improve the accuracy of nearest neighbour classification. In the approach we adopted, the objective function for metric learning is convex and, therefore, the required optimization can be cast as an instance of semidefinite programming.

This study presents a hierarchical segmentation model by compensating the heterogeneous topics in stream level and the heterogeneous words in document level. The topic similarity between sentences is calculated to form a beta prior for stream-level segmentation. This segmentation prior is adopted to group topic-coherent sentences into a document. For each pseudo-document, we incorporate a Markov chain to detect stylistic segments within a document. The words in a segment are generated by identical composition style.

The proposed algorithm uses ant colony optimization to guide the search directions toward the global optimal solution, the color information to measure the similarity between pairs of puzzles, and an effective reconstruction strategy to improve the end result. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with several state-of-the-art puzzle reconstruction algorithms. The simulations results show that the proposed algorithm out performs all the state-of-the-art algorithm we compared in this paper.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359630","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359630","Puzzle reconstruction problem;ant colony optimization;genetic algorithm","Abstracts;Accuracy","ant colony optimisation;computer games;search problems","ant colony optimization;color information;global optimal solution;high performance algorithm;jigsaw puzzle problem;performance evaluation;puzzle reconstruction problem;puzzle solver;search algorithm;search direction;similarity measure","","0","","25","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, given an n-dimensional probability distribution over real-valued random vectors, a point on the d-dimensional principal surface is a local maximizer of the distribution in the subspace orthogonal to the principal surface at that point. For twice continuously differentiable distributions, the surface is characterized by the gradient and the Hessian of the distribution. Furthermore, the nonlinear projections of data points to the principal surface for dimension reduction is ideally given by the solution trajectories of differential equations that are initialized at the data point and whose tangent vectors are determined by the Hessian eigenvectors. In practice, data dimension reduction using numerical integration based differential equation solvers are found to be computationally expensive for most machine learning applications. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a local linear approximation to achieve this dimension reduction without significant loss of accuracy while reducing computational complexity.

A novel method of suppressing clutter is proposed in this paper, which is mainly based on the Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) feature. The feature possesses rotation invariability and strong ability to distinguish weather targets between clutters, which is obtained after the reflectivity image is processed by the morphological method and is segmented with the region growing method. According to statistics, there are two thresholds in different areas and Doppler velocity values in the clutters are always between -1 and 1 m/s, but precipitation clouds are always of outside this range. So the proposed feature, regional area and the Doppler velocity are combined to form a 3-layered identification method.

Therefore, in this paper, a robust vehicle detector is developed. Our contribution is three-fold. Road modeling is first proposed to confine detection area for maintaining low computation complexity and reducing false alarms as well. Haar-like features and eigencolors are then employed for the vehicle detector. To tackle the occlusion problem, chamfer distance is used to estimate the probability of each individual vehicle.

Attribute reduction is a core problem in covering rough sets. The discernibility matrix is the theoretical foundation of finding attribute reduction. In this paper, we find it is unnecessary to compute all the elements of discernibility matrix, and we need to only find its minimal elements. The minimal element of discernibility matrix is the sufficient condition to compute attribute reductions with covering rough sets, and every minimal element is determined by one sample pair at least. Based on the above work, in this paper, firstly we define the relative discernibility relation. Secondly we develop the algorithm to find the minimal elements of covering rough sets by using the corresponding relationship between the minimal elements and sample pairs.

In deduplication systems, we need to use methods of information retrieval to find duplicate data chunks quickly. Chunk-lookup disk bottleneck problem is one of the most important problems in the information retrieval of deduplication systems. Previous methods can reduce RAM usage of index a lot to avoid reading index from disk for every chunk search. However, these methods still need several TB of RAM to hold the index for dozens of PB of storage space utilization. We design Linear Hashing with Key Groups(LHs), a variation of Linear Hashing, to organize and address bins. Based on LHs, we propose a novel method of information retrieval in deduplication, which can avoid an index in RAM by utilizing LHs to compute the address of a bin. A bin contains the chunk IDs of the similar files to a file. Then, we do not need to maintain an index in RAM to do the same thing. Our method does not decrease the deduplication efficiency compared with Extreme Binning, when it needs one disk read for every file. For every file, our method firstly computes the bin address of this file using LHs, loads the bin and then deduplicates the file against the loaded bin. Experimental results show that, while our method does not need an index in RAM, the deduplication efficiency of our method is slightly better than that of Extreme Binning.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359555","Deduplication;chunk-lookup disk bottleneck problem;index;linear hashing","Abstracts;Indexes;Random access memory","database indexing;information retrieval;random-access storage;search problems;storage management","LHS;RAM indexing;RAM usage;chunk search;chunk-lookup disk bottleneck problem;deduplication efficiency;deduplication systems;duplicate data chunks;extreme binning;information retrieval;key groups;linear hashing;storage space utilization","","1","","7","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to address these problems, in this paper, we proposed a GDRID (Generating Diverse and Relevant Image results with DivRank) visual search reranking algorithm, which extends the DivRank algorithm to enhance the diversity as well as relevance of the initial search results with visual information. DivRank is based on a reinforced random walk in an information network which can automatically balance the prestige and diversity of the top ranked vertices in a principle way.

Semi-supervised hashing (SSH) methods capture semantic similarity of data and avoid overfitting to training data. SSH outperforms supervised, unsupervised and Random Projection based hashing methods in semantic retrieval task. But, current semi-supervised and supervised hashing methods search by Hash lookup in a single hash table usually subject to a low recall. In order to achieve a high recall, an exhaustive search by hamming ranking is needed. It dramatically decreases the retrieval precision and increases the search time. In this paper, we propose to learn multiple semi-supervised hashing tables using boosting technique to overcome this problem. Multiple hash tables are learned sequentially with boosting to maximize hashing accuracy of each hash table. The mis-hash samples in the current hash table will be penalized by large weights and then the algorithm uses the new weight values to learn the next hash table. Given a query, the true semantic similar samples missed from the active buckets (the buckets in the small hamming radius of the query) of one hash table are more likely to be found in the active buckets of the next hash table.

Reasonable choices of the variables that are closely related to the primary air flow are used as input features.

However simply decreasing the number of calibration samples would decrease the performance of the algorithm if the algorithm suffers from curse of dimensionality or low signal to noise ratio. As a remedy, we propose estimating the performance of the algorithm during the calibration in an online manner, which would allow us to terminate the calibration session if required. Consequently, early termination means a reduction in time spent.

Three metrics, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and equivalent number of look (ENL), are used to evaluate the denoised image using the proposed algorithm. The results show that the signal-to-noise ratio is improved while the edges of object are preserved by the proposed algorithm. Systemic comparisons with other conventional algorithms, such as mean filter, median filter, RKT filter, Lee filter, as well as bivariate shrinkage function for wavelet-based algorithm are conducted. The advantage of the proposed algorithm over these methods is illustrated.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359515","Contourlet transform;Denoising;Heart Tube image;Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT);bivariate shrinkage","Abstracts;Biomedical optical imaging;Noise reduction;Optical imaging;Wavelet transforms","cardiology;edge detection;image denoising;maximum likelihood estimation;medical image processing;optical tomography;probability;wavelet transforms","CNR;ENL;OCT heart tube image;SNR;biomedical field;bivariate function;bivariate shrinkage function;contourlet transform;contrast-to-noise ratio;edge preservation;equivalent number of look;joint probability density function;maximum a posteriori estimation;nondestructive property;noninvasive property;optical coherence tomography heart tube image denoising;real-time property;signal-to-noise ratio;ubiquitous noise;wavelet-based algorithm","","0","","12","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a Korean to Chinese machine translation system by incorporating different linguistic data of Korean into the translation model. A state-of-the-art factored translation model is employed to verify the goodness of the proposed approach, which is efficient not only for the European languages, but also for Korean and Chinese.

This system can estimate the azimuth and elevation of a sound source in real-time and in sufficient accuracy. We add a SNR measure besides spectra entropy to help detect voiced frames. Next, synchronous FFT phase copying is adopted, and cross-power spectrum phase is calculated to estimate TDOA (time delay of arrival) for each frame. Also, to enhance the accuracy of TDOA, parabolic interpolation is adopted. Then, by comparing the estimated TDOA values with theoretic ones, the azimuth and elevation of a sound source can be determined. Since a pair of azimuth and elevation is estimated from each voiced frame, these estimated values are thereafter summed with a weighting method to give one final answer of azimuth and elevation. According to the experiment results, the average errors in estimating azimuth and elevation are 4.02 and 2.18 degrees, respectively.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359636","TDOA;crosspower spectrum phase;direction estimation;microphone array;sound source localization","Abstracts;Arrays;Azimuth;Microwave integrated circuits","acoustic signal processing;fast Fourier transforms;interpolation;microphone arrays;time-of-arrival estimation","SNR;TDOA estimation;cross-power spectrum phase;crosspower spectrum phase;parabolic interpolation;sound signals;sound-source localization system;spectra entropy;synchronous FFT phase copying;three-microphone array;time delay of arrival estimation","","0","","9","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This new technique can preserve the original significant structures while suppressing noises to the largest extent. To achieve this goal, dominant orientation information of all gradients is used to control the local kernel adaptively. This results in elongated and elliptical contours spread along the directions of the local edge structure. With these locally adapted kernels, the smoothing is mostly effective along the edges, rather than across them. Therefore details in the original input can be preserved. The performance of the proposed data-adaptive anisotropic filter together with its iterative scheme are compared with the conventional Gaussian filter, anisotropic diffusion filter, the structure-adaptive anisotropic filter, and the iterative kernel regression scheme. The experimental results on both simulated Gaussian and Poission noisy images indicate that the proposed method performs the best, and the iterative scheme can significantly improve the performance of the noise suppressing while delivering high computation efficiency.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359521","data-adaptive anisotropic filter;image processing;iterative image filtering","Abstracts;Noise","edge detection;filtering theory;image denoising;iterative methods;performance evaluation","adaptive local kernel control;elliptical contours;elongated contours;gradient orientation information;iterative data adaptive anisotropic image filtering;local edge structure;locally adapted kernels;noises suppression;performance improvement;simulated Gaussian noisy images;simulated Poission noisy images","","0","","11","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The impacts of some important factors on PEI have also been studied, such as users' genders, users' geography locations and the processes of events. Extensive experiments have been carried out using data from Sina Weibo.

Our work consists in proposing an algorithm which learns each class characteristics in a sequential way: each new observation will improve our object knowledge. This algorithm is particularly well suited to real time applications such as shape recognition or classification, but turns out to be a challenging problem. Indeed, the so-called classic machine learning algorithms in missing data problems such as the Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) are not designed to learn from sequentially acquired observations. Moreover, the so-called hidden data simulation in a mixture model can not be achieved in a proper way using the classic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the Gibbs sampler.

Many classifiers could not perform well in data imbalance cases. The major problem is that classifiers tend to ignore samples and accuracy of the minority class without regarding the higher cost of misclassification in this minor class. Therefore, pattern classification for imbalance data becomes a hot challenge to both academy and industry. In this paper, we propose an active learning method for imbalance data using a stochastic sensitivity measure (ST-SM) of Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). A large ST-SM indicates the RBFNN is uncertain and yields a large output fluctuation around a particular sample. These samples yielding large ST-SM values are selected for adding to the training set in each turn. Empirically, samples with large output perturbation (i.e. large ST-SM) should be located near the classification boundary and is of great significance for the training of classifier. As for the imbalance characteristic of the data set, the ST-SM should be able to reduce the number of redundant samples being selected in the majority class, rebalance the sample distribution of the training set, and finally improve the performance of the classifier.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6358972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6358972","Active learning;Imbalance data;Localized Generalization Error Model;Sample selection","Abstracts","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;stochastic processes","L-GEM;RBFNN;ST-SM;active learning method;classifiers;imbalance data problem;localized generalization error model;majority class;minority class;negative class data distributions;pattern classification;positive class data distributions;radial basis function neural network;stochastic sensitivity measure;training set","","0","","14","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method is based on a combination of variational inference and loopy belief propagation, where data is only communicated between neighboring nodes without the need for a fusion center. We show that for tree structured networks, under certain parameterization, dSBL coincides with centralized sparse Bayesian learning (cSBL). For general loopy networks, dSBL and cSBL are differend, yet simulations show much faster convergence over the variational inference iterations at similar sparsity and mean squared error performance.

However, relatively little research is conducted regarding the detection of fraudulent transactions at e-markets, such as Taobao, the largest C2C and B2C e-market in China. One of the main contributions of this paper is the illustration of a novel fraudulent transaction detection model developed based on the deceptive clues induced from transactional information archived at Taobao. More specifically the proposed detection model is underpinned by the probability distribution of a transaction being fraudulent. Accordingly, based on this estimated probability distribution of fraudulent transactions, an enhanced reputation mechanism is proposed to alleviate the effect of sellers' inflated reputations via fraudulent transactions. Furthermore, according to the rating rules on Taobao, an instantiation of the proposed reputation mechanism is made to apply it to a realistic e-market environment. The long-term implication of our research is that the marketers or managers of e-markets can design a fairer trading and reputation mechanism for their shopping websites.
