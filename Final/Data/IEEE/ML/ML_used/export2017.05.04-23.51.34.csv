In recent times, the power quality has been a major research concern due to changing regulations, liberalized distribution market and increased use of power electronic based equipment. The first step of any remedial action requires proper identification of PQ events. One of the major challenge of this event identification is to extract significant features from the limited measurements, which can subsequently be used for the classification. Therefore, in the present study Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) has been used to obtain several mathematical features. These features can segregate both single and simultaneous PQ event occurrences. Further to improve the classification performance, the ELM based classifier has been used. This classifier significantly reduces the training time by many-fold. The performance of the proposed approach has been compared with ANN based classifier considering over 1000 PQ signals from various PQ events. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve over 99% classification accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1546-7; POD:978-1-5090-1547-4","10.1109/SPEC.2016.7846169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846169","Classification;extreme learning machines;power distribution;power quality;signal processing","Feature extraction;Harmonic analysis;Power quality;Training;Transient analysis;Wavelet transforms","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power engineering computing;power supply quality;wavelet transforms","ELM-based classifier;WPT;extreme learning machine;liberalized distribution market;power electronic-based equipment;power quality event classification;wavelet packet transform","","","","","","","5-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The bootstrap re-sampling of training data was applied for each single ELM and then the individual ELMs are stacked, thereby enhancing the model accuracy and reliability.

This paper proposed a new adaptive myoelectric pattern recognition using advance online sequential extreme learning (AOS-ELM) for classification of the hand movements to five different positions.

Through the use of ELM, it is thus possible to improve the existing schemes especially the ones whose learning speed is not fast enough while addressing control problems. As a popular NN-based approach for control applications, direct heuristic dynamic programming (DHDP) with a good capability of adaptive learning has been successfully applied to solve control problems. But limited by slow learning algorithms in NN, it imposes very challenging obstacles to the real-time controller design of DHDP, which keeps it from widely applied. In this paper, driven by the interest of improving learning speed of DHDP while maintaining its good approximation performance, we employ ELM as a learning algorithm in DHDP. The proposed ELM-based DHDP learning scheme is tested on a cart-pole balancing control problem. The simulation results show the proposed scheme has better learning performance than traditional DHDP.

In our method, we devise a novel algorithm called OF-SIFT as the low-level feature. Deriving from the optical flow and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), it is designed to extract local motion information from the temporal domain rather than gradient-based local appearance from the spatial domain. The purpose of OF-SIFT is to generate a feature that can capture sufficient and distinctive dynamic motion information for motion detection without using the static state information of moving objects. Further, in order to develop a more compact image representation without considering the explicit vehicle geometry shape, we use the idea of Bag of Feature (BOF) model with spatial information to encode features. Finally, an extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier is introduced as the basic classifier owing to its excellent and fast generalization.

In this paper, based on the investigation on the influence that color spaces have on the representation learning of convolutional neural network, a novel traffic sign recognition approach called DP-KELM is proposed by using a kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) classifier with deep perceptual features. Unlike the previous approaches, the representation learning process in DP-KELM is implemented in the perceptual Lab color space. Based on the learned deep perceptual feature, a kernel-based ELM classifier is trained with high computational efficiency and generalization performance. Through the experiments on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark, the proposed method is demonstrated to have higher precision than most of the state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, when compared with the hinge loss stochastic gradient descent method which has the highest precision, the proposed method can achieve a comparable recognition rate with significantly fewer computational costs.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2614916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7742353","Traffic sign recognition;color space;convolutional neural network;extreme learning machine;kernel;lab.","Color;Computational efficiency;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Kernel;Neural networks;Training","","","","","","","","20161111","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

One such source is the wind energy, which is the reason for increased interest and intensified research in this field. There are many research papers dealing with the problem of forecasting the wind speed, since such knowledge is necessary in a number of applications, such as agriculture, modern transportation, and wind energy production. This paper presents an alternative approach to forecasting the wind speed based on extreme learning machine. The wind speed is modelled by means of available meteorological data such as total solar radiation, ambient temperature, humidity, barometer pressure, etc. The applied modeling algorithm belongs to the class of extreme learning machine methods, which are gaining an increasing interest in the scientific and research community. The conducted research has clearly showed that the ELM does not depend notably on the selection of the activation function for the hidden neurons. However, the random selection of the hidden layer parameters significantly influences its approximation capacity and generalization property. The paper offers a simple solution to the problem. The presented ELM model offers an alternative approach to modeling the wind speed on a short-term basis and the simulation results show clearly its advantages and very good performance indices.

Unlike traditional ELM, the number of hidden layers is not fixed priori in McELM, instead, the network is built during the learning phase. This algorithm is evaluated on a set of benchmark regression and approximation problems and also on a real-world wind force and moment coefficient prediction problem. Performance results in this study highlight that McELM can achieve better results compared with conventional ELM, support vector regression (SVR).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1025-7; POD:978-1-5090-1026-4","10.1109/CCIP.2016.7802886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7802886","Extreme Learning Machine (ELM);Meta-cognitive ELM (McELM);Self-regulation;Support Vector Machine (SVM);Support Vector Regression (SVR)","Approximation algorithms;Benchmark testing;Force;Learning systems;Neurons;Support vector machines;Training","approximation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;support vector machines","McELM;SVR;approximation problems;benchmark regression;coefficient prediction problem;metacognitive extreme learning machine;network update;regression problems;sample deletion;sample reservation;self-regulating learning mechanism;support vector regression","","","","","","","12-13 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These algorithms project image patches onto a feature space with the enforcement of a simple mapping to predict the fine resolution patches from the corresponding coarse ones. However, the sophisticated projection, e.g., sparse representation, is always computationally complex and difficult to be implemented on large patches, which cannot grasp enough local structural information in the coarse patches. To address these issues, a novel spatiotemporal fusion method is proposed in this letter, using a powerful learning technique, i.e., extreme learning machine (ELM). Unlike traditional approaches, we devote to learning a mapping function on difference images directly, rather than the sophisticated feature representation followed by a simple mapping. Characterized by good generalization performance and fast speed, the ELM is employed to achieve accurate and fast fine patches prediction. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by five actual data sets of Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus-moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer acquisitions and experimental results show that our method obtains better fusion results while achieving much greater speed.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2016.2622726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748638","Extreme learning machine (ELM);feature representation;local structural information;mapping function;spatiotemporal image fusion","Earth;MODIS;Remote sensing;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Training","geophysical image processing;image fusion;spatiotemporal phenomena;time series","ELM;Landsat enhanced thematic mapper;coarse patches;extreme learning machine;learning-based fusion method;local structural information;moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer;powerful learning technique;spatiotemporal fusion method;time series","","","","","","20161118","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The main task of clustering is to partition a data set into different classes or clusters according to a certain standard (such as distance criterion), which makes the similarity of the data objects in the same cluster as large as possible, while the difference between different clusters is as large as possible. Similarity measurement is the key to ensure that the similarity between the two elements in the same cluster is larger than the similarity between the two elements from different clusters, and also is larger than the similarity between the two clusters. In order to efficiently measure similarity and fast clustering, the State Learning Machine (SLM) is proposed in this paper. In the SLM two elements in the same cluster are regarded as a friend pair, therefore the clustering process becomes a novel approach of gathering friends. In the condition of large cluster differences, the SLM is not only able to cluster data fast and correctly with very low complexity, but also effectively detect the isolated points and noise points. It is not sensitive to the input order of noises and outlier data, furthermore, it can discover clusters with arbitrary shapes and can be applied to cluster big data efficiently.","","","10.1109/WCICA.2016.7578369","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7578369","","Algorithm design and analysis;Big data;Clustering algorithms;Computational efficiency;Containers;Open systems;Photonics","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","SLM;clustering algorithm;data object;similarity measurement;state learning machine","","","","","","","12-15 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ELM model is considered a promising method for data regression and classification problems. It has fast training advantage, but it always requires a huge number of nodes in the hidden layer. The usage of a large number of nodes in the hidden layer increases the test/evaluation time of ELM. Also, there is no guarantee of optimality of weights and biases settings on the hidden layer. DA is a recently promising optimization algorithm that mimics the moving behavior of moths. DA is exploited here to select less number of nodes in the hidden layer to speed up the performance of the ELM. It also is used to choose the optimal hidden layer weights and biases. A set of assessment indicators is used to evaluate the proposed and compared methods over ten regression data sets from the UCI repository. Results prove the capability of the proposed DA-ELM model in searching for optimal feature combinations in feature space to enhance ELM generalization ability and prediction accuracy.

This requires a detailed study of the effect of environmental forces of the marine structures. This paper aims at developing an unified framework to study the effect of wind force and moments on marine vessels. A neural network approach is developed to study the effect of longitudinal and side forces of wind, and the yaw moment. The study considers various types of marine vessels at different loading conditions, with a total of 22 marine vessels. Of these, 18 are used to train an ensemble of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) neural network. The network thus developed is tested for generalization on 2 new type of vessels at 2 different loading conditions. Thus, the developed model is capable of predicting the wind force and moment coefficients, irrespective of the type of vessel used. An Ensemble of extreme learning machine, each with input parameters initialized at different regions of the input space, are trained with all training samples. For each sample, the ELM that produces the least mean square error is identified, and the output of that ELM is considered as the output for that sample. Thus, the randomness of the initialization in ELM is exploited to achieve superior generalization performance. Performance study to predict the wind force and moment coefficients of marine vessels show that the ensemble of ELM has superior prediction performance, compared to state of the art results for this problem.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727566","Extreme Learning Machine (ELM);Multilayer Preceptron (MLP);Single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN);Support Vector Regression (SVR);Wind Force and moment drag coefficient","Dynamics;Force;Loading;Marine vehicles;Neural networks;Neurons;Wind forecasting","learning (artificial intelligence);marine vehicles;neural nets","ELM;ensemble;environmental forces;extreme learning machine;loading conditions;marine structures;marine vessels;moment coefficients;neural network approach;wind force prediction","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, the weighted least square (WLS) based system state estimator is used to produce the training data for the proposed forecaster. Traditionally, the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) are widely used in forecasting due to their nonlinear modeling capabilities. However, the ANN contains heavy computation load and the best parameters for SVR are difficult to obtain.

However, the dimensions of most existing feature descriptors are too huge, which limits their real applications. Moreover, features should be more effective to distinguish between smile face and non-smile face. Motivated by the observation that the mouth shape can effectively reflect a person's smile state, we extracted a novel and snappy set of features that form a feature vector named Pair-wise Distance Vector, which is calculated only based on few points around a mouth.

Secondly, in order to avoid the randomness of input dimensionality selection of the ELM, the phase space of each component is reconstructed. Thirdly, the ELM model of each component is established to predict the wind speed series. Finally, the predicted results of each component are superimposed to get the final result.

"Online Spatiotemporal Extreme Learning Machine for Complex Time-Varying Distributed Parameter Systems","X. Lu; F. Yin; C. Liu; M. Huang","","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","","2017","PP","99","1","1","Many industrial processes are complex nonlinear distributed parameter systems (DPSs) with time-varying spatiotemporal dynamics. However, time-varying spatiotemporal dynamics and the nonlinear relationships between spatial points are currently not given much consideration in the existing data-driven modeling methods. Thus, accurately modeling a nonlinear DPS with time-varying spatiotemporal dynamics using these current methods is challenging. Here we propose a spatiotemporal extreme learning machine (ELM) to accurately model time-varying and nonlinear DPSs. First, we develop the nonlinear spatial activation function to describe the nonlinear relationships between spatial points. As a result, in contrast to the traditional ELM method which is only used to model the temporal dynamics, the spatiotemporal ELM inherently takes the spatial information into consideration. Next, an online time coefficient model is developed, which accounts for the time-varying temporal dynamics of the DPS. After the integration of the spatial activation function with the time coefficient model, this modeling method is able to adapt to real-time spatiotemporal variation. Unlike the existing data-driven DPS modeling approaches, the proposed method has the capability to accurately represent the nonlinear relationships between spatial points and has the adaptive ability for modeling time-varying dynamics. Finally, through application on practical curing experiments, the proposed method can improve the modeling precision for an unknown, time-varying and nonlinear DPS due to smaller modeling error as compared to the several commonly used DPS modeling methods.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2017.2666841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7849212","","Adaptation models;Data models;Heating;Mathematical model;Power system dynamics;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Time-varying systems","","","","","","","","20170209","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

One of the most important challenges during learning from data streams is reacting to concept drift, i.e. unforeseen changes of the stream's underlying data distribution. Traditional methods always used online learning to handle the concept drift problem. However, online learning requires high time cost during online training. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a Kalman filtering approach, which can provide robust concept drift detection, to track concept drift. Once concept drift happens, the online extreme learning machine is applied to update the tracking model, whereas the offline extreme learning machine is used when no concept drift occurs. Based on this idea, we propose a fusion framework to combine online and offline extreme learning machine to efficiently track the data stream.

Along with the models, a few important features of the learning algorithms are discussed and alternative solutions are offered for some learning steps. Namely, the conducted research has clearly showed that the random selection of the hidden layer parameters significantly influences the approximation capacity of the classic extreme learning machine. The paper offers a simple solution to the problem. In addition, the research has confirmed that the incremental extreme learning machine indeed does not achieve the smallest possible approximation error due to the fact that the output parameters of the hidden nodes are not readjusted after the addition of each new hidden node. The paper also offers a simple solution to this problem. Finally, the convex incremental extreme learning machine tends to solve the accuracy problem of the incremental extreme learning machine. However, it still achieves smaller accuracy than the proposed solution in this paper.

The unlabeled target data, as useful knowledge, is also integrated as a fidelity term to guarantee the stability during cross-domain learning. It minimizes the matching error between the learned classifier and a base classifier, such that many existing classifiers can be readily incorporated as the base classifiers. The network output weights cannot only be analytically determined, but also transferrable. In addition, a manifold regularization with Laplacian graph is incorporated, such that it is beneficial to semisupervised learning.

Meanwhile, the model of SVM is not discriminative, because the labels of the image features are insufficient exploited.

"Biasing restricted Boltzmann machines using Gaussian filters to learn invariant visual features","A. Yogeswaran; P.

However, improving algorithms to increase the quality of these representations in the absence of labeled data is still an area of active research. This paper evaluates visual features learned through unsupervised learning, specifically comparing regularization and preprocessing methods using Gaussian filters on a single-layer network. Using the restricted Boltzmann machine as the unsupervised learning mechanism, features emerging through training on natural videos, with different biasing and preprocessing based on Gaussian filters, are compared by metrics to measure invariance as well as classification performance on standard datasets. When Gaussian filters are convolved with adjacent hidden layer activations from a single example during training, topographies begin to emerge where adjacent features become tuned to slightly varying stimuli. 1D, 2D, and 3D topographies are compared. When a Gaussian low-pass filter is applied to activations from a single hidden node across frames drawn from video, features that are more invariant to transformations are produced. Finally, when Gaussian filters are applied to the visible nodes, images become blurrier; learning from these images also leads to invariant features. The networks are trained using the Hollywood2 video dataset, and tested on image classification of the static CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets. To prove that the improvements are independent of the dataset, the networks are shown to produce similar results when trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The induction of topography or simple image blurring via Gaussian filters during training produce better discriminative features as evidenced by the consistent and notable increase in classification results that they produce. Also, in the visual domain, invariant features are d- sirable such that objects can be classified accurately despite transformations. It is found that most of the compared methods produce more invariant features, however, classification accuracy does not correlate to invariance.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4240-1; POD:978-1-5090-4241-8","10.1109/SSCI.2016.7850122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7850122","Gaussian filter;feature representation;image classification;invariant feature;object recognition;representation learning;restricted Boltzmann machine;topography;unsupervised learning","Information filters;Low-pass filters;Surfaces;Training;Unsupervised learning;Videos","Boltzmann machines;Gaussian processes;image classification;image filtering;unsupervised learning;video signal processing","1D topography;2D topography;3D topography;Gaussian low-pass filter;Hollywood2 video dataset;adjacent hidden layer activations;feature representations;image blurring;image classification;natural videos;restricted Boltzmann machine;single-layer network;static CIFAR-10 datasets;static STL-10 datasets;training;unlabeled data sets;unsupervised learning;visible nodes;visual features","","","","","","","6-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this PS-ELM algorithm, input connections between input and hidden layers are base vectors, which can sparsely map the input features into hidden layer by using gradient projection (GP) algorithm; The output weights between hidden and output layers can map the sparse features into class labels. This PS-ELM algorithm initializes the SLNN given superfluous number of hidden nodes. The subsequent training process consists of four iterative steps. The first one is to update base vectors by using Lagrange dual optimization. The second one is to prune zero base vectors which are considered to be insignificant. The third one is sparse coding which re-encodes the training samples given remained base vectors. The fourth one is to update output weight matrix by using ELM-like algorithm. This iterative process stops once the number of hidden nodes at current time is equal to the number at the last time. This PS-ELM algorithm can improve the sparsity and distinction of hidden layer feature representations. Meanwhile, the pruning is independent on hand-designed threshold.

Due to the poor quality and often complex image background and overlapping patterns characteristic of latent fingerprint images, separating the fingerprint region-of-interest from complex image background and overlapping patterns is a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a latent fingerprint segmentation algorithm based on fractal dimension features and weighted extreme learning machine. We build feature vectors from the local fractal dimension features and use them as input to a weighted extreme learning machine ensemble classifier. The patches are classified into fingerprint and nonfingerprint classes. We evaluated the proposed segmentation algorithm by comparing the results with the published results from the state of the art latent fingerprint segmentation algorithms. The experimental results of our proposed approach show significant improvement in both the false detection rate (FDR) and overall segmentation accuracy compared to the existing approaches.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1437-8; POD:978-1-5090-1438-5","10.1109/CVPRW.2016.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789523","","Databases;Fractals;Image segmentation;Manganese;NIST;Training","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence)","FDR;complex image background;crime scene;false detection rate;feature vectors;fingerprint region-of-interest;fractal dimension features;latent fingerprint image segmentation;overlapping patterns;weighted extreme learning machine ensemble","","","","","","","June 26 2016-July 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An Incremental Type-2 Meta-Cognitive Extreme Learning Machine","M. Pratama; G. Zhang; M. J. Er; S. Anavatti","La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia","IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","20170116","2017","47","2","339","353","Existing extreme learning algorithm have not taken into account four issues: 1) complexity; 2) uncertainty; 3) concept drift; and 4) high dimensionality. A novel incremental type-2 meta-cognitive extreme learning machine (ELM) called evolving type-2 ELM (eT2ELM) is proposed to cope with the four issues in this paper. The eT2ELM presents three main pillars of human meta-cognition: 1) what-to-learn; 2) how-to-learn; and 3) when-to-learn. The what-to-learn component selects important training samples for model updates by virtue of the online certainty-based active learning method, which renders eT2ELM as a semi-supervised classifier. The how-to-learn element develops a synergy between extreme learning theory and the evolving concept, whereby the hidden nodes can be generated and pruned automatically from data streams with no tuning of hidden nodes. The when-to-learn constituent makes use of the standard sample reserved strategy. A generalized interval type-2 fuzzy neural network is also put forward as a cognitive component, in which a hidden node is built upon the interval type-2 multivariate Gaussian function while exploiting a subset of Chebyshev series in the output node. The efficacy of the proposed eT2ELM is numerically validated in 12 data streams containing various concept drifts. The numerical results are confirmed by thorough statistical tests, where the eT2ELM demonstrates the most encouraging numerical results in delivering reliable prediction, while sustaining low complexity.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2016.2514537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7390064","Evolving neuro fuzzy system;extreme learning machine (ELM);fuzzy neural network (FNN);meta-cognitive learning;sequential learning","Complexity theory;Fuzzy neural networks;Learning systems;Standards;Training;Uncertainty","cognitive systems;learning (artificial intelligence)","Chebyshev series;cognitive component;eT2ELM;extreme learning algorithm;extreme learning theory;generalized interval type-2 fuzzy neural network;human meta-cognition;incremental type-2 meta-cognitive extreme learning machine;interval type-2 multivariate Gaussian function;online certainty-based active learning;semi-supervised classifier;statistical tests","","1","","","","20160122","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It can be widely applied into various tasks in computer vision and robotics. Most of pioneer methods extracted a set of low-level features and put them into classifier directly to identify scene category. But it has been proved that low-level features do not work well. Currently researchers aim to overcome the semantic gap between the low-level vision features and high-level semantic categories to improve the recognition performance. Therefore, much attention has been put on transforming low-level descriptors into richer intermediate representations. This paper proposed a novel method based on intermediate feature representation to solve the problem of recognizing the semantic category of scene image. This proposed method uses sparse coding on SIFT features and presents a spatial layout sensitive pooling method. The space layout for pooling is based on three rectangles with size of 1*1,1*4 and 4*1 in each image. They are derived from inherent characteristics of the scene images by regularly dividing the image in horizontal and vertical direction. This spatial pooling strategy is easier and it can get optimal representation of scene images. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is used as a classifier. ELM has shown great ability to fit nonlinear classification boundaries. Experimental results have shown that this proposed method not only extracts lower dimension image feature but also outperforms other similar state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition performance.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4102-2; POD:978-1-5090-4103-9; USB:978-1-5090-4101-5","10.1109/ICInfA.2016.7831818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7831818","Scene recognition;extreme learning machine;spatial pooling","Encoding;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image recognition;Layout;Semantics;Training","computer vision;feature extraction;image classification;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);transforms","ELM;SIFT features;computer vision;extreme learning machine;intermediate feature representation;layout-sensitive pooling;low-level vision features;lower-dimension image feature extraction;nonlinear classification boundaries;recognition performance;scene image optimal representation;scene image semantic category recognition;scene recognition","","","","","","","1-3 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proper number of hidden nodes is predefined through a trial and error approach. The convex incremental extreme learning machine (CI-ELM) has been proposed to tackle this problem. CI-ELM is an incremental constructive neural network with universal approximation abilities. However, we have found that some hidden nodes added into a hidden layer, may play a minor role in the network, which results in an increase in network complexity. In order to avoid this shortcoming, we propose here in an improved convex incremental extreme learning machine with optimal ridgelet hidden nodes (ICOR-ELM). The proposed method uses the ridgelet function as the activation function within the hidden layer. In each step of the learning process, the optimal hidden node parameters, which are optimized through particle swarm optimization (PSO), are added to the existing hidden layer. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve greater generalization performance with more compact architecture than other methods, and demonstrates faster convergence than other incremental ELM methods.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2033-1; POD:978-1-5090-2034-8","10.1109/JCSSE.2016.7748870","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748870","Convex incremental extreme learning machine;incremental constructive neural networks;particle swarm optimization;ridgelet function","Computer architecture;Computer science;Neural networks;Particle swarm optimization;Software algorithms;Software engineering;Training","convex programming;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;particle swarm optimisation","CI-ELM;PSO;PSO algorithm;constructive neural network;convex incremental extreme learning machine;hidden nodes size;network complexity;particle swarm optimization;ridgelet;universal approximation abilities","","","","","","","13-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional SAE, the training time of ML-ELM is significantly reduced from hours to seconds with high accuracy. However, ML-ELM suffers from several drawbacks: 1) manual tuning on the number of hidden nodes in every layer is an uncertain factor to training time and generalization; 2) random projection of input weights and bias in every layer of ML-ELM leads to suboptimal model generalization; 3) the pseudoinverse solution for output weights in every layer incurs relatively large reconstruction error; and 4) the storage and execution time for transformation matrices in representation learning are proportional to the number of hidden layers. Inspired by kernel learning, a kernel version of ML-ELM is developed, namely, multilayer kernel ELM (ML-KELM), whose contributions are: 1) elimination of manual tuning on the number of hidden nodes in every layer; 2) no random projection mechanism so as to obtain optimal model generalization; 3) exact inverse solution for output weights is guaranteed under invertible kernel matrix, resulting to smaller reconstruction error; and 4) all transformation matrices are unified into two matrices only, so that storage can be reduced and may shorten model execution time. Benchmark data sets of different sizes have been employed for the evaluation of ML-KELM. Experimental results have verified the contributions of the proposed ML-KELM.

Several optimal policies are obtained: first, the shortest expected processing time is optimal when only the nominal processing time is random; second, when the job-based learning rate is random, the optimal policy can be obtained by solving an assignment problem with random assignment cost. Computational study is conducted to offer insights on the behavior of optimal policy. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) is calculated as the difference between the expected objective value found by the optimal policy, and the expected objective value with perfect information.

It was found that there is no effect on the performance of ELM when small amount of noise is added to the input or the neurons in the hidden layer. Although the performance of ELM would improve with an increase in the number of neurons in the hidden layer, beyond a certain limit, this could lead to overfitting. In view of this, a parallel ELM (P-ELM) is proposed to improve the system performance. P-ELM has better robustness to noise due to the ensemble nature and is less susceptible to overfitting since each parallel hidden layer has only a moderate number of hidden neurons.

Anomaly detection (aka one-class classification or outlier detection) is an active area of research to identify safety risks in aviation. Aviation data is characterized by high dimensionality, heterogeneity (continuous and categorical variables), multimodality and temporality. To address these challenges, NASA Ames has developed several anomaly detection algorithms including MKAD, the present state of the art [1]. MKAD's computational complexity is quadratic with respect to the number of training examples which makes it time consuming (and sometimes infeasible) for mining very large data sets. In this paper, we utilize ELM's fast training and good generalization properties to develop scalable anomaly detection algorithms for very large data sets. We adapt unsupervised ELM algorithms such as the autoencoder and embedding models to perform anomaly detection. The unsupervised models capture the nominal data distribution and by choosing a desired strength of detection that defines the upper bound of outliers in the training data, the anomaly decision boundary is determined. The autoencoder model detects anomalies as the ones that have a large reconstruction error while the embedding model detects anomalies as the ones that lie outside a hypersphere in the embedded space. The proposed algorithms are applied to a real aviation safety benchmark problem and the results show that the ELM based algorithms are comparable to MKAD in detection while training is made faster by two orders of magnitude.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727444","","Adaptation models;Data models;Detection algorithms;Mathematical model;Safety;Training;Training data","aerospace computing;air safety;computational complexity;data mining;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","ELM fast training;MKAD computational complexity;anomaly decision boundary;autoencoder;aviation safety risks;embedding models;extreme learning machines;fast anomaly detection algorithms;large aviation data sets;nominal data distribution;one-class classification;outlier detection;outlier upper bound;real aviation safety benchmark problem;unsupervised ELM algorithms;very large data set mining","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A natural consequence of this is that many modern-day data centers experience very high internal traffic within the data centers themselves. The VMs with high mutual traffic often end up being far apart in the data center network, forcing them to communicate over unnecessarily long distances. The consequent traffic bottlenecks negatively affect both the performance of the application and the network in its entirety, posing non-trivial challenges for the administrators of these cloud- based data centers. The problem can, quite naturally, be compartmentalized into two phases which follow each other. First of all, the VMs are consolidated with a VM clustering algorithm, and this is achieved by utilizing the toolbox involving Learning Automata (LA). By mapping the clustering problem onto the Graph Partitioning (GP) problem, our LA-based solution successfully reduces the total communication cost by amounts that range between 34% to 85%. Thereafter, the resulting clusters are assigned to the server racks using a cluster placement algorithm that involves a completely different intelligent strategy, i.e., one that invokes Simulated Annealing (SA). This phase further reduces the total cost of communication by amounts that range between 89% to 99%. The analysis and results for different models and topologies demonstrate that the optimization is done in a fast and computationally-efficient way. Indeed, as far as we know, this paper pioneers the application of LA in the traffic-aware consolidation of virtual machines in data centers, and also pioneers a strategy which serializes the tools in LA and SA to optimize CC.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2914-3; POD:978-1-5090-2915-0","10.1109/NTMS.2016.7792430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792430","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Learning automata;Network topology;Partitioning algorithms;Servers;Topology","cloud computing;computer centres;graph theory;learning automata;pattern clustering;simulated annealing;virtual machines","VM clustering algorithm;cloud computing;cloud-based data centers;cluster placement algorithm;graph partitioning problem;intelligent traffic-aware consolidation;learning automata;optimization;simulated annealing;virtual machines","","","","","","","21-23 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have tested the generalization capability of the proposed classifiers on 6 synthetic datasets and two benchmark datasets.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727445","","Neurons;Optimization;Training","generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","ELM;consistency based model selection;extreme learning machine;generalization capability;multiclass classifiers;multiclass construction;one-class classifiers;random feature mapping;unknown outlier detection","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Fuzzy Restricted Boltzmann Machine: Novel Learning Algorithms Based on Crisp Possibilistic Mean Value of Fuzzy Numbers","S. Feng; C. L. P. Chen","School of Applied mathematics, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, and also with the Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macau, China (e-mail: fengshuang@bnuz.edu.cn).","IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","","2016","PP","99","1","1","A Fuzzy Restricted Boltzmann Machine (FRBM) is extended from a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) by replacing all the real-valued parameters with fuzzy numbers. A new FRBM that employs the crisp possibilistic mean value of a fuzzy number to defuzzify the fuzzy free energy function is presented. This approach is much clearer and easier to obtain the expression of defuzzified free energy function and its approximation than the centroid method. Several theorems that discuss the error bounds of the approximation to ensure the rationality and validity are also investigated. Learning algorithms are given for the designed FRBM with symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers (STFNs), asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers (ATFNs) and Gaussian fuzzy numbers. By appropriately choosing the parameters, a theorem is concluded that all FRBMs with symmetric fuzzy numbers will have identical learning algorithm to that of FRBMs with STFNs. This is illustrated by a case of FRBM with Gaussian fuzzy numbers. Two experiments including MNIST handwriting recognition and Bar-and-Stripes benchmark are carried out. The results show that the proposed FRBMs significantly outperform RBMs in learning accuracy and generalization ability, especially when encountering unlearned samples and recovering incomplete images.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2639064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782438","Crisp possibilistic mean value;fuzzy RBM;fuzzy number;learning algorithm","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Benchmark testing;Handwriting recognition;Probability distribution;Training;Training data","","","","","","","","20161213","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"Evolutionary Cost-Sensitive Extreme Learning Machine","L. Zhang; D. Zhang","College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China.","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","","2016","PP","99","1","16","Conventional extreme learning machines (ELMs) solve a Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of hidden layer activated matrix and analytically determine the output weights to achieve generalized performance, by assuming the same loss from different types of misclassification. The assumption may not hold in cost-sensitive recognition tasks, such as face recognition-based access control system, where misclassifying a stranger as a family member may result in more serious disaster than misclassifying a family member as a stranger. Though recent cost-sensitive learning can reduce the total loss with a given cost matrix that quantifies how severe one type of mistake against another, in many realistic cases, the cost matrix is unknown to users. Motivated by these concerns, this paper proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive ELM, with the following merits: 1) to the best of our knowledge, it is the first proposal of ELM in evolutionary cost-sensitive classification scenario; 2) it well addresses the open issue of how to define the cost matrix in cost-sensitive learning tasks; and 3) an evolutionary backtracking search algorithm is induced for adaptive cost matrix optimization. Experiments in a variety of cost-sensitive tasks well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, with about 5%-10% improvements.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2607757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7588107","Classification;cost matrix;cost-sensitive learning;extreme learning machine (ELM).","Access control;Face;Face recognition;Kernel;Learning systems;Neurons;Training","","","","1","","","","20161011","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The proposed controller can maintain high performance in the presence of motor parameter uncertainties and load disturbances. The conventional design procedure for an H<sub>∞</sub> controller is to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation which requires full information of the system model. The novel control method, the integral reinforcement learning (IRL) makes use of neural networks to parametrically represent the control policy and the performance of system, and learns the solution of HJI equations online. Therefore, the FSPM machine can work optimally under parameter uncertainties due to different operating conditions. The simulation in Matlab/Simulink vividly illustrates the control performance for a 45kW, rotor speed 9000 rpm, 12/5 poles flux-switching permanent magnet machine.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3474-1; POD:978-1-5090-3475-8","10.1109/IECON.2016.7793201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7793201","","Approximation error;Artificial neural networks;Learning (artificial intelligence);Mathematical model;Optimal control;System dynamics;Uncertain systems","H<sup>∞</sup> control;control system synthesis;learning systems;machine control;neurocontrollers;permanent magnet machines;switching systems (control)","FSPM machine;H<sub>∞</sub> controller design;H<sub>∞</sub> tracking;HJI equation;Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation;IRL;Matlab;Simulink;high speed flux-switching permanent magnet machine;integral reinforcement learning;load disturbances;motor parameter uncertainties;neural networks;optimal control;poles flux-switching permanent magnet machine;rotor speed","","","","","","","23-26 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
