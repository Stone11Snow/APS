The fuzzy neural networks have advantages of both fuzzy expert systems (knowledge representation) and artificial neural networks (learning). The fuzzy neural networks can be trained successfully to estimate NVWQ for different traffic flow patterns and different conditions intersection. This greatly reduces a lot of effort of extracting traffic expert's knowledge into fuzzy if-then rules. All we have to do is to present training data to the network which will figure out its own rules through internal representation.

However, a trained SVM (Support Vector Machine) with good adaptability can be applied to classify sawtooth and nonsawtooth samples. The samples can be obtained by a rectangular sample window sliding along the edge of the leaf, and then be rotated to a standard pose for decreasing the complexity of identification.

In this paper, an algorithm, which summarizes a document by extracting subtopics from the sentences, is based on statistics and partially understanding message, in order to get better summarization and get rid of the dependence on domain. Besides, since it is difficult to determine the length of a summary manually, the algorithm also strives to obtain a better summary with proper length. To this end, a new module of mutual dependence is put forward too and applied to segmentation, which can select accuracy features for the summarizing algorithm. And then new rules are brought forward to evaluate sentences for the summarizing algorithm.

First, an initial state set and a control input set of the plant are selected; then the output curves in its inertial time are recorded; third, the optimal control input-output couples set is picked out according to several optimal criterions; and finally, rule base is constructed based on that set.

In this paper we present the concepts of asymmetric similarity model and heavy frequency vector (HFV). The former can detect subset copies well; the latter can save a great resources and CPU time. We develop two new asymmetric measures: HFM and HIPM. The HFM and HIPM are derived from cosine function and proportion function by combining asymmetric similarity concept with HFV. The HFV is to truncate the original full frequency vector to a short vector. We can adjust the parameter of HFV to balance the model's performance.

DTW is a method for flexible pattern-matching scheme. It translates, compresses, and expands a pairs of patterns so that similar features within the two patterns are matched. DTW is used in spoken word recognition widely. Similarly, DTW has the ability to synchronize two trajectories from batch process and provides an elegant solution to the synchronization of batch trajectories. MSDTW is combination of DTW and wavelet, and is used for synchronization more precise than DTW. MSDTW firstly decomposes original trajectories into approximations and details at different scales. Contributions from each scale are collected in separate matrices, and data are synchronized at each level based on DTW respectively. Then synchronized separate matrices are reconstructed to form new synchronized trajectories. Application to industrial process making process illustrates the MSDTW is valid and precise.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259913","","Automation;Chemical technology;Feature extraction;Frequency synchronization;History;Information science;Matrix decomposition;Pattern matching;Speech processing;Speech recognition","batch processing (industrial);matrix algebra;pattern matching;synchronisation","batch process;batch trajectories;batch trajectory;industrial process;multiscale DTW;multiscale dynamic time warping;pattern-matching scheme;spoken word recognition;synchronized separate matrices;wavelet","","4","","13","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a Markov model based technique for similarity/distance measures of variable-length time sequences. State space of Markov model is partitioned by hierarchical clustering method, and the information of state-transition is used to represent a time series. The similarity/distance measures of time sequences can be defined as various functions of the difference between their state-transition information, and some widely used distance measures can be considered as our specific cases. In addition, in modeling procedure, the vector sequence in reconstructed phase space is used instead of the original time sequence, which more effectively reflects the dynamical property of time series. Experimental results show that it works well under the strong noise environment, and it is versatile for various applications by its flexible definition.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264486","","Computer science;Data mining;Databases;Educational institutions;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;State-space methods;Time measurement;Time series analysis","Markov processes;data mining;time series","Markov model;data mining;hierarchical clustering method;similarity measure;state-transition information;time series database;variable-length time sequences","","2","","12","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article, aiming at the specialties of RENMINGBI(RMB) currency image, puts forward a method using linear transform of image gray to diminish the influence of the background image noises in order to give prominence to edge information of the image.

We put up a method of extracting key frames from shots, according to the content variation of the latter. An updated time-adaptive algorithm is used to group the shots into scene and representative frames are extracted in the region of that scene using the method of generating Minimum Spanning Tree. Key frames and representative frames can represent the content of shots and scenes, respectively. The organized sequences of key frames and representative frames are the two-level video abstraction.

The term of coincidence degrees is then introduced to reflect the degree of correlation about a fuzzy number with a given rule pool. Furthermore, some basic properties for location values are considered, and techniques for computing location values in terms of some special metrics are also presented. All these will offer a basis for further researches about the theory of evolutionary computations under uncertain environments.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259979","","Evolutionary computation;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms;Job shop scheduling;Manufacturing systems;Processor scheduling;Production systems;Uncertainty","fuzzy set theory;fuzzy systems;genetic algorithms","coincidence degrees;complex manufacturing systems;degree of correlation;evolutionary algorithms;evolutionary computations;fuzzy numbers;fuzzy techniques;intelligent computations;production line scheduling;rule pool","","0","","22","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But smoothness still exists, especially on edges. The smoothing process can be described as a traditional heat diffusion equation. In this paper, this equation is combined with an improved edge-directed interpolation method to improve visual quality in terms of sharpened edges. Experimental results indicate that the combination of the two methods is capable of achieving images with noticeably sharper edges.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1260062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260062","","Computational efficiency;Constraint theory;Heat engines;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Interpolation;Lattices;Nonlinear equations;Smoothing methods;Spatial resolution","edge detection;image enhancement;image resolution;interpolation;smoothing methods","edge directed interpolation method;heat diffusion equation;image resolution;linear techniques;nonlinear image interpolation method;smoothing process","","2","","3","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the discussion is focused on the theory of edge detection. An efficient image edge detection operator, Canny operator, is introduced to the processing of arc image. The performance of Canny operator and the traditional operators in the practical edge detection of arc image is analyzed. Experimental results prove that Canny operator is better than Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt, Log operators by analyzing weak edge region in the switching arc image.

Six-channel EEG data of four subjects were recorded while they performed three different mental tasks. Approximate one-second data segments were divided and transformed to multi-scale representations by dyadic wavelet packet decomposition channel by channel. Power values of different sub-spaces of six-channel EEG signals formed the feature vectors. A radial basis function (RBF) network was applied to classify the three task pairs. The average classification accuracy of four subjects over three task pairs is 85.3%. Compared with the two autoregressive (AR) model methods, wavelet packet transform would be a promising method to extract features from EEG signals.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264502","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264502","","Bayesian methods;Biomedical engineering;Brain modeling;Data mining;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Radial basis function networks;Wavelet packets;Wavelet transforms","autoregressive processes;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;radial basis function networks;signal classification;wavelet transforms","EEG;autoregressive model methods;dyadic wavelet packet decomposition;electroencephalogram;feature extraction;mental tasks;multiscale representations;radial basis function network;wavelet packet transform","","8","","4","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
