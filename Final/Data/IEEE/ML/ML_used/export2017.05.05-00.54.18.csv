Second, we describe some concepts of attribute-value reduction. The key idea of attribute-value reduction is to keep the consistence degree, i.e. fuzzy lower approximation value of certain decision class invariant before and after reduction. Third, a set of rules which covers all the objects in the original dataset can be obtained after the description of rule representation system in fuzzy decision table.

The most important issues of supplier management include supplier capability to deliver on time, long term contract strategy with suppliers, supplier evaluation, and quality of material from suppliers.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621094","Management decision;Outsourcing;SCM;Supplier management","Collaboration;Companies;Contracts;Machine learning;Materials;Organizations;Supply chains","outsourcing;supply chain management","Taiwanese enterprises;outsourcing strategies;supplier management","","0","","18","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A method of suppliers evaluation and choice based on AHP and fuzzy theory","Bo-Hui Pang","College of Management, Harbin University of Commerce, 150001, China","2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20080905","2008","3","","1664","1669","During recent years, how to determine suitable suppliers in the supply chain has become a key strategic consideration. However, the nature of these decisions usually is complex and unstructured. In general, many quantitative and qualitative factors such as quality, price, and flexibility and delivery performance must be considered to determine suitable suppliers. The evaluation process typically consists of identifying the attributes and factors relevant to the decision, and measuring the performance of a supplier by considering the relevant factors. Much of the data are difficult to obtain and ambiguous or vague to interpret. Nonetheless, a rational process of evaluation must exist to select the most appropriate suppliers. This paper proposes fuzzy comprehensive method for evaluating the suppliers based on AHP. The method combines AHP and fuzzy theory and provides a comprehensive evolution method for choosing partner of supply chain. Finally, an example is shown to highlight the procedure of the proposed method at the end of this paper. This paper shows that the proposed model is very well suited as a decision making tool for supplier selection decisions.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620673","Fuzzy logic;analytical hierarchy process;supplier evaluation;supply chain management","Costs;Cybernetics;Decision making;Educational institutions;Fuzzy set theory;Linear programming;Machine learning;Manufacturing;Supply chain management;Supply chains","decision making;fuzzy set theory;supply chain management","AHP;decision making tool;fuzzy comprehensive method;fuzzy theory;key strategic consideration;supplier selection decisions;suppliers evaluation;supply chain","","0","","13","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Technique of process has been mature. If it is used in planning, it will promote development of planning. First, a planning problem must be translated to a planning operation through signal quantification. A planning operation contains four sets, namely action-process set, semaphore set, initial semaphore set and objective semaphore set. PSP has pre-dealing and main part. Pre-dealing classifies action-processes to assign priority. Pre-dealing uses transcendental information which improves speed of algorithm. Main part determinates sequence of action-processes by exclusion and synchronization. Exclusion and synchronization are redefined in this paper. Synchronization determinates which action-process should execute before another. Exclusion determinates which action-process could not execute with another together. New definition, non-spending semaphore, are proposed. If two action-processes just compete for non-spending semaphore, they can run concurrently. Non-spending semaphore improves concurrency of PSP.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620751","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620751","Exclusion;Non-spending semaphore;Planning operation;Process semaphore planning;Synchronization","Computer science;Concurrent computing;Conference management;Cybernetics;Fuels;Machine learning;Operating systems;Process planning;Waste management","operating systems (computers);planning (artificial intelligence);synchronisation","action process;algorithm speed;nonspending semaphore;planning operation;process management;process semaphore planning;signal quantification;synchronization;transcendental information","","1","","10","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to that the exponential function is used in the conventional nonlocal filtering, several new kernel functions are proposed in this paper to be further incorporated into the conventional nonlocal filtering framework to develop new filters.

However, current incentive methods donpsilat consider the change of human needs in construction and are inadequate to analyze the impacts of incentive factors allocation on project risk and cost due to the complexity and dynamics of the project in a real world. And therefore, there is a need for a model to solve this problem. In this paper, a system dynamic model is built to simulate the impacts of incentive factors allocation on project risk and cost. Firstly, behavioral factors which encourage staff efforts to decrease risk and cost are obtained by questionnaire. Causal loop diagram containing these factors is then built and the system dynamic model is established by visualization system dynamic model software iThink, which shows how the allocation of incentive factors affects project risk and cost. And then a sensitive analysis is used to testify the validity of the model, from the outputs, an incentive cost input can be obtained at the lowest level of risk and cost. Finally, this paper carries on policy simulation tests. In this simulation, different ratios of every incentive factors in different periods correspond to different lowest risk and cost, which are the results of the simulation. Thus, optimal allocation of incentive cost among incentive factors and incentive factors among departments is solved.

Thus, a CWWU base robot can perform the static and dynamic balancing function that a single wheel with inverse mouse-ball drive developed by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) can achieve. The previous rolling/balancing machines cannot immediately drive in a given direction without first re-orienting the drive mechanism. The major feature of the presented CWWU base robot and the CMU robot is that both of them can move directly in any direction. As compared the Omni wheel base robot with the proposed one, the main drawback of the Omni wheel robot is the cancellation of opposite portion of the driving forces. Moreover, the CWWU base robot has several exclusive features which can resolve some problems inherited in the CMU robot. Especially, the simultaneous demand of both a high-friction and low-friction material for the spherical ball is a compromise needed to make for the CMU robot, but not for the proposed CWWU base robot.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621067","CWWU;Omni wheel;Spherical wheel","Actuators;Axles;Cybernetics;Ellipsoids;Machine learning;Mobile robots;Service robots;Shape;Stability;Wheels","mobile robots;wheels","Carnegie Mellon University;Omni wheel base robot;inverse mouse-ball drive;rolling-balancing machines;spherical wheel;static-dynamic balancing function","","2","","5","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the total available energy of all the nodes is limited, the network life is 92% longer using the IEA strategy than using the uniform initial energy assignment strategy; when the total energy of all nodes is unlimited, the network lifetime on the IEA strategy will increase about 12 times longer than on the uniform energy allocation. The numerical approximation for the IEA strategy is presented in this paper, and the nodes density and the radius of deployment are also discussed to maximize the network lifetime.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621112","Energy assignment;Energy balance;Heterogeneous network;Network lifetime;Nodes placement","Computer science;Cybernetics;Energy consumption;Intelligent networks;Machine learning;Network topology;Power system modeling;Relays;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks","resource allocation;wireless sensor networks","heterogeneous wireless sensor network;initial energy assignment;load balance;sensor network lifetime","","3","","8","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The initial level set function is constructed from region of interest (ROI) on the internal markers. In this way, an automatic initialization of the level set evolution can be obtained, and the boundaries of the objects can be extracted. The cost time does not depend on the size of the image but the region of internal marker because only level set function with markers is updated instead of the level set function for each pixel.

According to the features of data streams, a new algorithm, call DSCFCI, is proposed for mining frequent closed patterns with item constraints in data streams. The data stream is divided into a set of segments, and a new data structure called DSCFCI-tree is used to store the potential frequent closed patterns with item constraints dynamically. With the arrival of each batch of data, the algorithm builds a corresponding local DSCFCI-tree firstly, then updates and prunes the global DSCFCI-tree effectively to mine the frequent closed patterns with item constraints in the entire data stream.

However, one presented binary mining algorithm is only suitable for mining some relative short frequent item sets since the way of generating candidate item sets is also similar to apriori, another is only suitable for mining long frequent item sets, which generates candidate item sets by up-down search strategy. And so aiming to mining general frequent item sets, this paper proposes an algorithm of association rules double search mining based on binary, which is different from tradition association rules mining algorithm based on double search strategy.

Secondly, we proposed a novel classification algorithm combining the Choquet integral with respect to the lambda-measure based on gamma-support proposed by our previous work and the improved logistic regression algorithm to further improve the above situation. For evaluating the performances of the SVM, logistic regression and our new algorithm with gamma-support based on lambda-measure and P-support respectively, a real data experiment by using leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy is conducted.
