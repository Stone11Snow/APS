How to allocate these resources efficiently is critical in proceeding of cooperation and competition. Auction-based method is often adopted in the settings. This paper presents an improved mathematically computable model based auction theory by introducing a variable use-factor. In this model, there is a seller agent with multi-item goods to sell while many buyer agents want to buy the goods. By analyzing optional bidding and numerical computing, it is found that the variable use-factor influences obviously the agentspsila utility and bidding. This model is beneficial for the future mechanisms design both in agent-based software engineering and various distributed system, especially Internet-based commerce applications.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620532","Auction-based allocation;Multi-agent system;Use-factor;Utility function","Application software;Cybernetics;Game theory;Humans;Internet;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Mathematics;Multiagent systems;Resource management","electronic commerce;multi-agent systems","auction-based allocation;auction-based multiagent system;optional bidding;variable use-factor","","0","","10","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is also a new discipline with great growth potential since knowledge acquisition and assimilation has become one of the most important ingredients in modern business practice. KM-related research within science and engineering could help provide the theoretical and infrastructural support that is needed by practitioners and researchers in this new field. The study of the intellectual structure of a discipline was pioneered by researchers in information science in the early eighties. The intellectual structure of KM had been studied earlier by researchers in the information systems (IS) field. The finding of IS researchers is idiosyncratically inclined toward IS related research. Our study draws on the CiteSeer citation index, which is primarily a computer engineering and information science citation database. The intellectual structure of KM derived from a predominantly science and engineering oriented index is quite different from what has been provided by IS researchers. Our results reveal sub areas that appear to form the conceptual groundwork of KM. Besides, these current research themes of KM were also explored, further identifying research trends in KM. It was found that the study of semantic based peer-to-peer computing is one of the most important of these trends.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620424","Citation analysis;Intellectual structure;Knowledge management","Citation analysis;Conference management;Cybernetics;Frequency;Information management;Information science;Information technology;Knowledge management;Machine learning;Visualization","citation analysis;knowledge management","engineering oriented index;information science citation database;information systems;knowledge acquisition;knowledge assimilation;knowledge management studies;peer-to-peer computing","","0","","16","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The example-based high-level semantic retrieval algorithm (EHSR) and the text-based high-level semantic retrieval algorithm (THSR) for image retrieval using high-level semantic content were designed and implemented respectively. The performance of an experimental image retrieval system constructed according to aforementioned approaches was evaluated on a database of around 3000 images.

Basically, the edge enhancement consists of two stages. First, the edge in the enlarged image is enhanced by Laplacian filter. This doing relieves the blur in the enlarged image. Next, the zigzag edge in the image after Stage 1 is solved by smoothing neighborhood pixels around edges which are located by Canny edge detector.

To get exact clusters, we use all paths less than or equal to length L as feature vectors for XML document.

Moreover, on this improving dynamic background updating method, this paper proposes a kind of motion object detection algorithm based on piecemeal principal component analysis. Differentiating from the traditional method whose principal component analysis is used to deal with the whole image, this method carries on piecemeal processing to the whole image, and then, principal component analysis is used to deal with each block of the image in order to give prominence to the principal characteristic. And the block of this principal characteristic contains motion object. So, we can detect the motion object easily.

We extend the surface representation from a single-scale representation to a multi-scale representation using the concept of scale-space. Multi-scale surface representation provides a set of surface approximations at different levels of smoothness. This allows the user to manipulate a model in a flexible and intuitive way without worrying about whether or not the surface detail is properly affected. We use a fairing operator to generate successively smoother approximation levels of a given input surface , and encode each level relative to the next smoother level using normal displacements to ensure intuitive detail preservation.

To achieve it, we combine two ideas: 1) Firstly, we introduce a novel technique, which is based on genetic algorithm, to generate new samples. At each boosting round, it generates new samples and expands the training set. By this way, our method can avoid overfitting, and produce classifiers with high predictive accuracy. 2) Secondly, by sharing features across classes, we reduce the computational cost of the learned classifiers at run time, when detecting multiclass objects in cluttered scenes.

In our method a bottom-up way is followed, in which the sensitivity of a neuron is first considered and then is that of the entire network. The main contribution of the method is that it requests a weak assumption on the input, that is its elements need only to be independent identically distributed, and thus is more practical to real applications.

Due to the concentrations of CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub> have declined, the focus of health studies and control efforts has increasingly turned to PM<sub>10</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> as the most important air pollutant species of concern.

Moreover, selecting the same set of descriptors for different classes of images may not be reasonable. In this work we propose a MPEG-7 descriptor selection method which selects different MPEG-7 descriptors for different image class in an image classification problem. The proposed method L-GEMIM combines Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM) and Mutual Information (MI) to assess the relevance of MPEG-7 descriptors for a particular image class. The L-GEMIM model assesses the relevance based on the generalization capability of a MPEG-7 descriptor using L-GEM and prevents redundant descriptors being selected by MI. Experimental results using 4,000 images in 4 classes show that L-GEMIM selects better set of MPEG-7 descriptors yielding a higher testing accuracy of image classification.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620448","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620448","Image Classification;Localized Generalization Error Model;MPEG-7 Descriptor Selection;Mutual Information","Computer errors;Cybernetics;Filters;Humans;Image classification;Image retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Machine learning;Mutual information;Testing","generalisation (artificial intelligence);image classification","MPEG-7 descriptor selection;generalization capability;image classification problem;localized generalization error model;mutual information","","3","","25","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The number of the passengers who are waiting for elevators can be obtained through detecting device, which is called passive pyroedetric infrared sensor device for body detection. The feasibility of the scheme is validated by sub-area experiment. In this way, the traffic mode of the EGCS can be judged in real time. There are two scheduling algorithms based on fuzzy control theory developed in the paper. The multi-strategy switch method is used to schedule elevators when there is new call according to traffic.

However, as the number of training patterns increases, EFMAM encounters difficulties in hardware realization, because its network architecture becomes larger and larger. Meanwhile its space and time complexity also rapidly increase. The reason consists in the un-economization of empirical kernel map (EKM) vectors in EFMAM. In this paper, we propose an economized EFMAM, called E<sup>2</sup>FMAM, which first define a criterion to economize EKM vectors, then use the famous genetic algorithms (GAs) to search the optimum. The simulation results show that E<sup>2</sup>FMAM has less space and time complexity than EFMAM, and a comparable recognition performance to EFMAM in terms of the tolerance to different types and levels of noise or information incompletion.

However, the materials of the piezo-actuators are ferroelectric, they fundamentally exhibit hysteresis behavior in the response to an applied electric field. This research focuses on the controlling of the piezoelectric positioning stage. In order to study the sensitivity of tuning the PID parameters to achieve the desired performance, the grey relational analysis has been proposed. Therefore, by tuning the PID parameters, the proposed controller owns the capability in handling such uncertain information. The experimental results of the proposed grey relational methodology also show that it is technically and economically feasible to develop a low-cost, reliable, automatic, less time-consuming controller for piezoelectric positioning stage.

In particular, semantic Web services are based on synchronous message exchange, thus being incompatible with the REST architectural model of the (semantic) Web. Recent advances in middleware technologies propose semantic aware tuplespaces as an infrastructure for coping with these issues. However, all of the existing related works do not support rule in their extensions of tuplespace.

In order to resolve the moral hazard and adverse selection problems of the contractor in the construction quality insurance system, the insurer must design a set of optimal incentive contracts for contractors to be selected, so as to judge their true information in terms of their selecting results and make them work hard. Considering the contractorpsilas intrinsic motivation, this paper sets up an optimal incentive contract model when both contractorpsilas types and actions are unobservable. Following the revelation principle, we analyze and solve the model by applying the optimal controlling theory, and we discuss the importance of intrinsic motivation. The conclusions show that the intrinsic motivation is more efficient than extrinsic incentive. Accordingly the insurer should fully consider the contractorspsila intrinsic motivation in the contract.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620496","Construction quality insurance;adverse selection;extrinsic incentive;intrinsic motivation;moral hazard","Construction industry;Contracts;Ethics;Games;Hazards;Insurance;Machine learning","construction industry;contracts;human factors;incentive schemes;optimal control","China;construction quality insurance system;contractor adverse selection problems;engineering quality safety challenge;intrinsic motivation;moral hazard problems;national real estate industry;optimal controlling theory;optimal incentive contract","","0","","19","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm has been widely used for image matching application. The SIFT algorithm can successfully extract the most descriptive feature points in given input images taken under different viewpoints. However, the performance of the original SIFT algorithm degrades under the influence of noise. We propose to modify the SIFT algorithm to produce better invariant feature points for image matching under noise. We also propose to employ the Earth mover's distance (EMD) as the measurement of similarity between two descriptors. We present extensive experiment results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in image matching under noise.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620974","EMD;Feature points;SIFT;matching","Cybernetics;Histograms;Image matching;Machine learning;Noise;Pixel;Smoothing methods","computer vision;image matching;image reconstruction;object recognition;transforms","3D image reconstruction;Earth movers distance;computer vision;image matching;modified sift descriptor;object recognition;object tracking;scale invariant feature transform","","2","","8","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, large applications always involve several fields and particular applications may only pay attention to a local domain in these large Bayesian networks within a long period of time. Motivated by this situation, this paper shifts attention to local representations, and concentrates on finding a method of extraction without loss of any information and free of dataset by capturing local graphical characterizations of large Bayesian networks. From the graphical perspective, this paper first captures two local graphical characterizations to determine the skeleton and V-structure of local models respectively. Moreover, several transformation rules are elicited from these local characterizations, and local representations can be obtained though applying these rules to the global network. The local representations can not only offer compact and intuitive representations for local domains concerned, but also allow evidence propagate in a smaller model other than the entire model.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620688","Directed acyclic graph (DAG);graphical characterization;local representations;transformation rules","Bayesian methods;Cybernetics;Data mining;Electronic mail;Inference algorithms;Information science;Knowledge representation;Machine learning;Object oriented modeling;Skeleton","Bayes methods;inference mechanisms","Bayesian networks;knowledge representations;local graphical characterizations;local representation extraction;probabilistic inference","","0","","19","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
