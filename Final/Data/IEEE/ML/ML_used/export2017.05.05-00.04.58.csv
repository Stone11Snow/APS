Previous studies indicated that the group diversity had positive influence on the group work achievement. Therefore, how to achieve diversity within a group effectively and automatically is an interesting question. In this paper we propose a novel clustering-based grouping model. The proposed technique first employs balanced K-means algorithm to divide the students into several size-balanced clusters, such that the students within the same cluster are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other clusters, then adopts one-sample-each-cluster strategy to construct the groups<sup>1</sup>. We evaluated the proposed technique based on two small-scale case studies.

In Fatigue Analysis this is the state-of-the-art data employed for calculating the fatigue life of components. We (i) study the usability of random forests modeled on this kind of data to distinguish between faulty and non-faulty vehicles, and (ii) address the problem of selecting a small number of relevant variables in order to further decrease the misclassification rate and, even more important from our engineering point of view, to identify failure related variables. As our data contains just very few samples of faulty compared to non-faulty vehicles, we furthermore present a framework for tuning the random forest to handle this class imbalance.

"Transient Characteristics of DC-DC Converter with PID Parameters Selection and Neural Network Control","H. Maruta; D. Mitsutake; F. Kurokawa","Grad. Sch. of Eng., Nagasaki Univ., Nagasaki, Japan","2014 13th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","20150209","2014","","","447","452","This paper presents a neural network based PID parameter selection control to improve the transient response of dc-dc converters. In the conventional PID control, parameters of it such as proportional, integral, and differential coefficients are selected as fixed parameters to regulate both transient and steady-state characteristics simultaneously as much as possible. The parameter setting of PID control is not optimal for the improvement of transient-state characteristics since the setting needs to satisfy stable steady-state characteristics. Therefore, the parameter selection for different states is widely applicable from the point of view of the improvement of transient response. In this study, we present a novel parameter selection method for PID control based on the load change prediction of neural network to improve the transient response of dc-dc converter. In the presented method, suitable PID parameters are selected with neural network. This neural network is trained to predict the load change from the output voltage of dc-dc converter in advance. From the predicted result of neural network, PID parameters are changed to optimal ones after the load change occurs. Additionally, the reference modification with another neural network, which is trained to modify the reference value of PID control, is also adopted simultaneously to obtain more effective improvement of transient response. From evaluation results, we confirm that our presented method contributes to obtain an effective improvement of the transient response compared to the conventional PID control.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033157","PID control;dc-dc converter;neural network","DC-DC power converters;Neural networks;PD control;Training;Transient analysis;Transient response;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;load regulation;machine control;neurocontrollers;parameter estimation;three-term control;transient response","DC-DC converter;PID control;load change prediction;neural network control;parameter selection method;reference modification;transient response","","0","","12","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Bregman Divergence was introduced to extend PCA with maximum likelihood in exponential family distribution. In this work, we study this generalized form PCA for Bernoulli variables, which is called Logistic PCA (LPCA). We extend the batch-mode LPCA to a sequential version (SLPCA).

However, according to the clinical experience, it is important to know the effects of risk factors on women's blood pressure during pregnancy. Thus, we examined the effects of known risk factors (age, hematocrit, etc.) over gestational age. We also examined whether the effects of known risk factors are different between gestational hypertension group and preeclampsia group. These were studied in 412 pregnant women including 1874 clinical follow-up records. On the longitudinal clinical data of pregnant women, varying coefficient models were applied to study the effects of known risk factors over gestational age. The results showed that the effects of known risk factors varied with gestational age, and the changing processes of known risk factors over gestational age were different between gestational hypertension group and preeclampsia group. In final, we used the relative error as the criterion to assess the accuracy of the estimated varying coefficient model. The relative errors for total clinical data, gestational hypertension group and preeclampsia group were 13.3%, 8.1% and 14.3%, respectively.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033091","Varying Coefficient Model;gestational hypertension;longitudinal data","Adaptation models;Blood;Blood pressure;Data models;History;Hypertension;Pregnancy","blood pressure measurement;data handling;medical computing;medical disorders;obstetrics;risk analysis","clinical experience;clinical follow-up records;gestational age;gestational hypertension;longitudinal clinical data;preeclampsia group;pregnancy;pregnant women blood pressure;relative error;risk factor;varying coefficient model","","2","","20","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this sense, we are dealing with the problem of integrating a new class into the image classifier on-the-fly, once specified on-line by an operator. We are using evolving fuzzy classifiers (EFC), which are relying on fuzzy rule bases and are able to adapt their structure and update their parameters in incremental manner. The novel methodological aspects lie (1.) in appropriate structural changes in the EFC whenever a new class appears and (2.) in the estimation of the expected change in classifier accuracy on the older classes seen before, which is based on an analysis of the expected change in the classifier's decision boundaries. The second point is an important aspect for operators, as they are already familiar to work with established classifiers that have some accuracy in classification.

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical probabilistic matrix factorization (BHPMF) model to (1) incorporate hierarchical side information, and (2) provide uncertainty quantified predictions. The former yields significant performance improvements in the problem of plant trait prediction, a key problem in ecology, by leveraging the taxonomic hierarchy in the plant kingdom. The latter is helpful in identifying predictions of low confidence which can in turn be used to guide field work for data collection efforts. A Gibbs sampler is designed for inference in the model. Further, we propose a multiple inheritance BHPMF (MI-BHPMF) which can work with a general directed acyclic graph (DAG) structured hierarchy, rather than a tree. We present comprehensive experimental results on the problem of plant trait prediction using the largest database of plant traits, where BHPMF shows strong empirical performance in uncertainty quantified trait prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art based on point estimates. Further, we show that BHPMF is more accurate when it is confident, whereas the error is high when the uncertainty is high.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033133","Bayesian Analysis;Probabilistic Matrix Factorization;Uncertainty Quantification","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Biological system modeling;Covariance matrices;Predictive models;Sparse matrices;Uncertainty","belief networks;botany;directed graphs;inference mechanisms;matrix decomposition;probability","Bayesian hierarchical probabilistic matrix factorization model;DAG structured hierarchy;Gibbs sampler;MI-BHPMF model;data collection;empirical performance;general directed acyclic graph structured hierarchy;hierarchical side information;inference;low-confidence prediction identification;low-rank matrix completion methods;missing entries;multiple inheritance BHPMF;performance improvements;plant kingdom;plant trait prediction problem;point estimation;taxonomic hierarchy;uncertainty quantified matrix completion;uncertainty quantified trait prediction","","0","","28","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The spectral learner extends the word presence model by applying Boolean logic operators (AND, OR, and XOR) to the word presence features to identify useful higher-order features. These spectral features can be used in other learning algorithms, and we show how the performance of other learning algorithms can be improved by these features.

Here, we present a semi-supervised learning approach that automatically labels the semantic slots in a set of training data and aims to strike a balance between the dependence on labelled data and prediction accuracy. The essence of our algorithm is to cluster clauses based on a similarity function that combines lexical and semantic information. We present experiments that compare different similarity functions for both our semi-supervised setting and a fully unsupervised baseline. While semi-supervised learning expectedly outperforms unsupervised learning, our results show that (1) this effect can be observed based on very few training data instances and that increasing the size of the training data does not lead to better performance, and (2) that lexical and semantic information contribute differently in different domains so that clustering based on both types of information offers the best generalisation.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.87","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033166","interactive systems;natural language processing;semantic slot labelling;semi-supervised learning","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Measurement;Motion pictures;Semantics;Training;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern clustering;pattern matching","lexical information;natural language processing;semantic information;semantic slot labelling;semisupervised clustering approach;similarity function;unsupervised learning","","2","","34","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some auxiliary objectives can be used to obtain the optimum of the target objective in less number of objective evaluations. We call such auxiliary objective a supporting one. Usually there is no prior knowledge about properties of auxiliary objectives, some objectives can be obstructive as well. What is more, an auxiliary objective can be both supporting and obstructive at different stages of the target objective optimization. Thus, an adaptive online method of objective selection is needed. Earlier, we proposed a method for doing that, which is based on reinforcement learning. In this paper, a new algorithm for adaptive online selection of optimization objectives is proposed. The algorithm meets the interface of a reinforcement learning agent, so it can be fit into the previously proposed framework.

This paper considers the possibility of discretizing visually acquired signatures to represent them as an unordered collection of words and then use Sequential Mining Optimization (SMO) for training Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the signature as either legitimate or forged. Signature discretization is done using Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) [4]. SAX reduces the dimensions of the signature and produces a list of SAX words that are then represented as a bag-of-patterns model for classification purposes [6].

A most commonly used algorithm in learning RBMs is called Contrastive Divergence (CD) proposed by Hinton, which starts a Markov chain at a data point and runs the chain for only a few iterations to get a low variance estimator. However, when referring to a high-order RBM, since there are interactions among its visible layers, the gradient approximation via CD learning usually becomes far from the log-likelihood gradient and even may cause CD learning to fall into an infinite loop with high reconstruction error. In this paper, a new algorithm named Cyclic Contrastive Divergence (CCD) is introduced for learning high-order RBMs. Unlike the standard CD algorithm, CCD updates the parameters according to each visible layer in turn, by borrowing the idea of Cyclic Block Coordinate Descent method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed CCD algorithm, regarding to high-order RBMs learning, both algorithms CCD and standard CD are theoretically analyzed, including convergence, estimate upper bound and both biases comparison, from which the superiority of CCD learning is revealed. Experiments on MNIST dataset for the handwritten digit classification task are performed. The experimental results show that CCD is more applicable and consistently outperforms the standard CD in both convergent speed and performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033095","Convergence;Cyclic Contrastive Divergence Learning;Gradient Approximation;High-order RBMs;Upper Bound","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Charge coupled devices;Hidden Markov models;Standards;Topology;Training","Boltzmann machines;Markov processes;approximation theory;feature extraction;gradient methods;handwritten character recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical distributions","CCD learning;CD algorithm;CD learning;MNIST dataset;Markov chain;cyclic block coordinate descent method;cyclic contrastive divergence learning algorithm;data point;feature extraction;gradient approximation;handwritten digit classification task;high-order RBM;log-likelihood gradient;probabilistic graphical model;reconstruction error;restricted Boltzmann machine;training data;variance estimator","","1","","20","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently due to availability of large amount of data and cheap computing resources (processing power and memory) non-parametric based approach to solve speech recognition and classification task is becoming popular and feasible. The key advantage of non-parametric based approach is that all the information from the training data is retained as we don't approximate our data with specific statistical models resulting in more speaker specific information. In this paper we propose a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) phoneme prediction scheme using speaker ranking vector. Speaker ranking vector is calculated by finding the similarity of the given TEST speaker with the Instance Space using k-NN. The results were compared with nearest neighbor and k-NN majority voting approach. Our proposed scheme gives a better prediction accuracy as compare with nearest neighbor and k-NN majority voting scheme. This approach can help speech recognizer to customize on the fly for a given talker and customize training data on the basis of similarity measure.

"Recommendation Systems for Markets with Two Sided Preferences","A. Goswami; F. Hedayati; P. Mohapatra","Dept. of Comput.

Recommendation systems are critical components of such markets. It is to be noted that the matching in such a market depends on the preferences of both sides, consequently, the construction of a recommendation system for such a market calls for consideration of preferences of both sides. The online dating market, and the online freelancer market are examples of markets with two-sided preferences. Recommendation systems for such markets are fundamentally different from typical rating based product recommendations. We pose this problem as a bipartite ranking problem. There has been extensive research on bipartite ranking algorithms. Typically, generalized linear regression models are popular methods of constructing such ranking on account of their ability to be learned easily from big data, and their computational simplicity on engineering platforms. However, we show that for markets with two sided preferences, one can improve the AUC (Area Under the receiver operator Curve) score by considering separate models for preferences of both the sides and constructing a two layer architecture for ranking.

Searching and organizing large scale multimodal datasets is a challenging task. Supervised methods such as support vector machine (SVM) achieve state of the art performance for music classification on single modality, but suffer from over-fitting on training examples and limitations of single modality approaches.

It is difficult to solve it using methods of molecular dynamics or quantum physics because these methods deal with time intervals of nanoseconds or microseconds, while conformation motions take time of millisecond order. In addition, these methods cannot take external forces into consideration. To deal with these problems, numerous approximated and coarse-grained methods are developed, which use ideas from geometry and motion planning. We present a new coarse-grained method of modeling the protein motion between two given conformations. The method is based on optimization of a cost function similar to the one in the Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem. The optimization is performed using sep-CMA-ES, which makes the running time of an iteration linear in the number of amino acids in a protein. The proposed method is compared with some of the existing methods on several molecules.

Previous CAD models have relied on radiologist-delineated contours to extract image features and classify lung nodules into semantic ratings. Manually creating these contours can be time-consuming and expensive. This paper proposes a different CAD system based on multiple machine-sourced segmentations that can provide semantic ratings at least as accurate as a panel of experts in order to aid in the diagnostic process. However, the mass production of machine-sourced segmentations may sometimes produce unwanted noise. Therefore, we propose to filter out the bad segmentations by applying an outlier detection algorithm that identifies segmentations that are far away from the majority of the segmentations. Our results are compared to a CAD system based on expert-sourced contours and a reference truth generated by radiologists' semantic ratings. Using the Lung Image Database Consortium dataset, we show that machine-sourced segmentations provide predictions at least as good as expert-sourced segmentations and how outlier removal affects mostly shape-dependent semantic ratings.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033168","computer-aided diagnosis;crowd-sourcing;lung cancer;machine-sourced;segmentation","Accuracy;Cancer;Design automation;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Lungs;Semantics","feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;lung;medical image processing;visual databases","CAD models;computer-aided diagnosis systems;expert-sourced segmentation;image feature extraction;lung image database consortium dataset;lung nodule classification;machine-sourced segmentation;outlier detection algorithm;semantic ratings","","0","","18","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, a critical task is to detect and isolate faults, as fast as possible, and restore optimal operating conditions in the shortest time. In this paper, a machine learning of graphical models approach is proposed for fault diagnosis of wind turbines, in particular pitch system. The role of the latter is to adjust the blade pitch angle by rotating it according to the current wind speed in order to optimize the wind turbine power production. This is achieved by a controller based on blade pitch angles measured by two redundant sensors in each blade. Without the sensor accuracy reading, the controller can be misled and fail to achieve the optimal control strategy according to the current operation conditions. In addition, pitch angle sensors complete failure can lead to dangerous actions of the controller, while fixed or drifted bias of sensor measurements may decrease the controller's efficiency. To better control and overcome these challenges, we propose a methodology that is based on Gaussian acyclic graphical models and the lasso estimate. The methodology has shown the ability to model, and diagnose faults that occur in the pitch system in wind turbines during its normal run and could lead to a fast recovery to the optimal operating conditions.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033186","Wind turbine;pitch system;the lasso estimate","Benchmark testing;Blades;Fault diagnosis;Graphical models;Sensors;Wind turbines","Gaussian processes;blades;fault diagnosis;fault tolerant control;optimal control;pitch control (position);regression analysis;wind turbines","Gaussian acyclic graphical models;Lasso estimate;blade pitch angle sensors;component reliability;drifted bias;fault detection;fault diagnosis;fault isolation;fixed bias;graphical model based approach;machine learning;optimal control strategy;optimal operating conditions;pitch system;redundant sensors;sensor accuracy reading;wind speed;wind turbine maintenance cost;wind turbine operation cost;wind turbine power production optimization","","0","","24","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, finding the interesting patterns is a challenging task due to the large number of rules that are generated. Traditionally, this task is done by post-processing approaches that explore and direct the user to the interesting rules of the domain. Some of these approaches use the user's knowledge to guide the exploration according to what is defined (thought) as interesting by the user. However, this definition is done before the process starts. Therefore, the user must know what may be and what may not be interesting to him/her. This work proposes a general association rule post-processing approach that extracts the user's knowledge during the post-processing phase. That way, the user does not need to have a prior knowledge in the database. For that, the proposed approach models the association rules in a network, uses its measures to suggest rules to be classified by the user and, then, propagates these classifications to the entire network using transductive learning algorithms. Therefore, this approach treats the post-processing problem as a classification task. Experiments were carried out to demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the number of rules to be explored by the user and directs him/her to the potentially interesting rules of the domain.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033134","Association Rules;Label Propagation;Networks;Post-Processing;Pruning","Association rules;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Databases;Equations;Mathematical model;Silicon","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","association rule post-processing approach;classification task;transductive learning algorithm","","0","","12","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, if behavior of auxiliary objectives change during the optimization process, it can be better to use reinforcement learning algorithms which are specially developed for non-stationary environments. In our previous work we proposed a new reinforcement learning algorithm to be used in the EA+RL method. In this work we propose an improved version of that algorithm.

Sybil detectors in social networks leverage the assumption that Sybils will find it hard to befriend real users which leads to Sybils being connected to each other forming strongly connected sub graphs that can be detected using graph theory. However, the large majority of Sybils are in fact successful in integrating themselves into real user communities (such as the case in Twitter and Facebook).

We also explore various types of Twitter Sybil accounts detection features with the objective of building an effective and practical classifier. In order to build and evaluate our classifier, we collect and manually label a dataset of twitter accounts, including human users, bots, and hybrid (i.e., Tweets are posted by both human and bots).

In this paper, we propose an approach for human action recognition based on motion capture (MOCAP) information using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Distance based metrics computed from MOCAP information of only three human joints are used in the computation of features. The range and temporal variation of these distance metrics are considered in the design of features which are discriminative for action recognition. A convolutional neural network capable of recognizing local patterns is used to identify human actions from the temporal variation of these features, which are distorted due to the inconsistency in the execution of actions across observations and subjects. Experiments conducted on Berkeley MHAD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033108","convolutional neural networks (CNN);motion capture (MOCAP)","Feature extraction;Joints;Measurement;Neural networks;Pelvis;Punching;Three-dimensional displays","convolution;feature extraction;motion estimation;neural nets;object recognition","Berkeley MHAD dataset;CNN;MOCAP information;convolution neural networks;distance based metrics;distance metrics;human action recognition;human behavior semantic analysis;human joints;local pattern recognition;motion capture information;range variation;temporal variation","","2","","17","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A stream is an ordered sequence of data records. It is characterized by properties such as the potentially infinite and rapid flow of instances. However, a property that is common to various application domains and is frequently disregarded is the very high fluctuating data rates. In domains with fluctuating data rates, the events do not occur with a fixed frequency. This imposes an additional challenge for the classifiers since the next event can occur at any time after the previous one. Anytime classification provides a very convenient approach for fluctuating data rates. In summary, an anytime classifier can be interrupted at any time before its completion and still be able to provide an intermediate solution. The popular k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier can be easily made anytime by introducing a ranking of the training examples. A classification is achieved by scanning the training examples according to this ranking. In this paper, we show how the current state-of-the-art k-NN anytime classifier can be made more accurate by introducing diversity in the training set ranking. Our results show that, with this simple modification, the performance of the anytime version of the k-NN algorithm is consistently improved for a large number of datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033103","Anytime Algorithm;Classification;Data Stream;Nearest Neighbor","Accuracy;Approximation algorithms;Artificial neural networks;Image recognition;Indexes;Sorting;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","anytime nearest neighbor classification;data stream learning algorithms;k-NN anytime classifier;k-nearest neighbor anytime classifier;ordered data record sequence;training set ranking;very high fluctuating data rates","","0","","12","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we addressed the transfer of knowledge between deep networks used as classifiers of digit and shape images, considering cases where only the set of class labels, or only the data distribution, changed from source to target problem. Our main goal was to study how the performance of knowledge transfer between such problems would be affected by varying the number of layers being retrained and the amount of data used in that retraining. Generally, reusing networks trained for a different label set led to better results than reusing networks trained for a different data distribution. In particular, reusing for less classes a network trained for more classes was beneficial for virtually any amount of training data. In all cases, retraining only one layer to save time consistently led to poorer performance. The results obtained when retraining for upright digits a network trained for rotated digits raise the hypothesis that transfer learning could be used to better deal with image classification problems in which only a small amount of labelled data is available for training.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033142","artificial neural networks;deep learning;transfer learning","Knowledge engineering;Radio access networks;Shape;Standards;Training;Training data;Vectors","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);software architecture","data distribution;deep architectures;knowledge reusing;labelled data;stacked auto-encoders;transfer learning applications","","0","","11","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some instances (such as outliers or noise) can be detrimental. However, at least initially, the instances in a data set are generally considered equally in machine learning algorithms. Many current approaches for handling noisy and detrimental instances make a binary decision about whether an instance is detrimental or not. In this paper, we 1) extend this paradigm by weighting the instances on a continuous scale and 2) present a methodology for measuring how detrimental an instance may be for inducing a model of the data. We call our method of identifying and weighting detrimental instances reduced detrimental instance learning (RDIL). We examine RDIL on a set of 54 data sets and 5 learning algorithms and compare RDIL with other weighting and filtering approaches. RDIL is especially useful for learning algorithms where every instance can affect the classification boundary and the training instances are considered individually, such as multilayer perceptrons trained with back propagation (MLPs).

However, such automated attacks come at a relatively high cost as they require human experts to create labels for the unlabeled CAPTCHA samples collected from a website in order to train an attacking system. In this work we utilize active and semi-supervised learning methods for breaking audio CAPTCHAs. We show that these methods can reduce the labeling costs considerably, resulting in an increased vulnerability of audio CAPTCHAs as automated attacks are rendered even more worthwhile.

We model typical motions associated with normal behaviors with a set of motion subspaces, computed through low-rank matrix approximation. Then, abnormal human behaviors are identified by the motion deviations from the representative subspaces. Our method does not require a complicated classification procedure, and can fast detect abnormal events in complex scenes. In addition, through the adaptive learning module, our model is built on the observed data, and can be expanded by incorporating new behavior patterns during the detection process. The results on simulated surveillance videos show the effectiveness of our method.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033135","abnormal event detection;adaptive learning;low-rank approximation","Adaptation models;Approximation error;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Motion segmentation;Surveillance","approximation theory;behavioural sciences;image classification;image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;object detection;object tracking;video surveillance","abnormal event;abnormal human behavior detection;adaptive learning module;automatic detection;behavior pattern;classification procedure;detection process;low-rank matrix approximation;matrix approximation-based approach;matrix approximation-based method;motion deviation;motion matrix;object tracking;simulated surveillance video;video surveillance","","1","","24","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Novel Bayesian Network Based Scheme for Finding the Optimal Solution to Stochastic Online Equi-partitioning Problems","S. Glimsdal; O. C. Granmo","Dept. of ICT, Univ. of Agder, Grimstad, Norway","2014 13th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","20150209","2014","","","594","599","A number of intriguing decision scenarios, such as order picking, revolve around partitioning a collection of objects so as to optimize some application specific objective function. In its general form, this problem is referred to as the Object Partitioning Problem (OOP), known to be NP-hard. We here consider a variant of OPP, namely the Stochastic Online Equi-Partitioning Problem (SO-EPP). In SO-EPP, objects arrive sequentially, in pairs. The relationship between the arriving object pairs is stochastic: They belong to the same partition with probability p. From a history of object arrivals, the goal is to predict which objects will appear together in future arrivals. As an additional complication, the partitions of related objects are required to be of equal cardinality. The decision maker, however, is not informed about the true relation between the objects, he is merely observing the stream of object pairs, and has to predict future behavior. Inferring the correct partitioning from historical behavior is thus a significant challenge, which becomes even more difficult when p is unknown. Previously, only heuristic sub-optimal solution strategies have been proposed for SO-EPP. In this paper, we propose the first it optimal solution strategy. In brief, the scheme that we propose, BN-EPP, is founded on a Bayesian Network representation of SO-EPP problems. Based on probabilistic reasoning we are not only able to infer the correct object partitioning with optimal accuracy. We are also able to simultaneously infer p, allowing us to accelerate learning as object pairs arrive. Being optimal, BN-EPP provides superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art solution schemes. BN-EPP is also highly flexible, being capable of encoding object partitioning constraints. Finally, BN-EPP is parameter free - its performance does not rely on fine tuning any parameters. As a result of these advantages, BN-EPP opens up for significantly improved performance for OOP based appl- cations.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033183","","Bayes methods;Convergence;Meteorology;Noise;Partitioning algorithms;Probabilistic logic;Stochastic processes","belief networks;inference mechanisms;optimisation","BN-EPP;Bayesian network representation;NP-hard problem;OOP;SO-EPP;novel Bayesian network based scheme;object partitioning problem;probabilistic reasoning;stochastic online equi-partitioning problems","","0","","14","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The resulting algorithm establishes a tree-based multi-label classifier called LaCova which dynamically interpolates between two well-known baseline methods: Binary Relevance, which assumes all labels independent, and Label Power set, which learns the joint label distribution. The key idea is a splitting criterion based on the label covariance matrix at that node, which allows us to choose between a horizontal split (branching on a feature) and a vertical split (separating the labels).

Each trajectory represents the characteristic style of a vocalist during one of four common musical events: (1) Crescendo, (2) Diminuendo, (3) Ascending Pitches and (4) Descending Pitches. The unique shapes of these trajectories characterize the singing style of each vocalist with respect to each of these events.

In this paper, we proposed time warping SAX, which extends the standard SAX with time delay embedding vector approaches to account for temporal correlations. We test time warping SAX with the BoP representation on 12 benchmark datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification/Clustering Collection. On 9 datasets, time warping SAX overtakes the state-of-the-art performance of the standard SAX. To validate our methods in real world applications, a new dataset of vital signs data collected from patients who may require blood transfusion in the next 6 hours was tested. All the results demonstrate that, by considering the temporal internal correlation, time warping SAX combined with BoP improves classification performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033126","","Correlation;Electrocardiography;Error analysis;Standards;Time series analysis;Training;Vectors","data mining;pattern classification;pattern clustering;time series","BoP representation;UCR time series classification/clustering collection;bag-of-patterns representation;blood transfusion;classification performance;internal temporal correlation;standard SAX;standard symbolic aggregation approximation;temporal internal correlation;time delay embedding vector approach;time series data mining algorithm;time warping SAX;time warping symbolic aggregation approximation","","2","","18","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A two stage neural network training algorithm is used that employs Newton's algorithm to estimate a vector of hidden unit optimal learning factors in each iteration. In order to reduce the size of the neural network and train it more effectively, the forecaster uses both subsetting and transformation types of feature selection, reducing the number of neural net inputs by 70 %. This reduces the chances of memorization giving a good optimal forecaster. Interestingly, networks with more input variable types perform as well as smaller networks having fewer variable types.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033122","feature selection;forecasting;neural networks","Forecasting;Humidity;Neural networks;Solar radiation;Training;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","Newton algorithm;learning factors;multivariable neural network forecasting;neural net inputs;two stage feature selection;two stage neural network training algorithm","","0","","38","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We characterize the joint distribution of the response and covariates via a Stick-Breaking Prior. This leads to, in the various cases, nonparametric models for an infinite mixture of Inverse Gaussian, Multinomial Probit and Exponential Regression. Estimates of the localized mean function which maps the covariates to the response are presented. We prove the weak consistency for the posterior distribution of the Exponential model (SB-EX) and then propose mean field variational inference algorithms for the Inverse Gaussian, Multinomial Probit and Exponential Regression. Finally, we demonstrate their superior accuracy in comparison to several other regression models such as, Gaussian Process Regression, Dirichlet Process Regression, etc.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033127","Dirichlet Process;Exponential Regression;Inverse Gaussian Regression;Probit Regression;Variational Inference","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Estimation;Inference algorithms;Linear regression;Mathematical model;Parameter estimation","Gaussian processes;inference mechanisms;mathematics computing;mixture models;nonparametric statistics;regression analysis;statistical distributions","Dirichlet process regression;GLM;Gaussian process regression;exponential model posterior distribution;exponential regression;generalized linear model;infinite mixtures;inverse Gaussian;joint response covariates distribution;localized mean function estimates;mean field variational inference algorithms;multinomial probit;nonparametric models;regression models;stick-breaking prior","","0","","21","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two popular approaches that have been applied for improving classification accuracy and statistical comparisons of imbalanced data sets are: synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and propensity score matching (PSM). A novel sampling approach is introduced referred to as over-sampling using propensity scores (OUPS) that blends the two and is simple and easy to perform resulting in improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over both SMOTE and PSM. The performance of our proposed approach is assessed using a simulation experiment and several performance metrics are shown where this approach fares and falls in comparison to the others.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033153","","Accuracy;Data models;Equations;Machine learning algorithms;Sensitivity;Training","pattern classification;statistical analysis","OUPS;PSM;SMOTE;classification accuracy;novel sampling approach;over-sampling using propensity scores;propensity score matching;real world data sets;statistical comparisons;synthetic minority over-sampling technique","","5","","7","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Greedy layer-wise training of an auto-encoder has achieved promising results in deep neural networks. However, it can not learn useful input representation from the original input directly. In this work, we propose to use the bi-firing activation function for auto-encoder with an end-to-end training scheme. It not only improves the training efficiency but also learns better features than the traditional stacked auto-encoder. Experimental results show that it extracts more representative features and also outperforms the stacked auto-encoder in supervised classification task.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4217-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4215-2; POD:978-1-4799-4214-5","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009128","Auto-encoder;Bi-firing function;Deep Learning;Layer-wise scheme","Abstracts;Accuracy;Lead;Training;Tuning","feature extraction;gradient methods;image classification;image representation;neural nets","auto-encoder;bi-firing activation function;end-to-end training scheme;feature extraction;gradient diffusion problem;greedy layer-wise training;supervised classification task;whole deep neural network","","1","","18","","","13-16 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
