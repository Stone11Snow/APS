However, the method suffers from two problems. Firstly, close class pairs may still exist and tend to overlap in the subspace. As a result, a suboptimal classification error rate may be obtained. Secondly, local max-min distance analysis achieves better classification performance by applying an iteration technique, but it greatly increases the computations involved. In this paper, regularized max-min distance analysis for dimension reduction is proposed to deal with the above problems by introducing the Fisher criterion. In addition, a kernel trick is used to extend regularized max-min distance analysis to cope with the general case of data distribution. Experimental results on both synthetic data sets and real data sets show that the proposed algorithm can outperform or be comparable to local max-min distance analysis in almost all the cases without resorting to the iteration procedure.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6358898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6358898","Dimension reduction;Fisher criterion;Max-min distance analysis;Regularization","Abstracts;Face;Nickel","Gaussian processes;iterative methods;pattern classification","Fisher criterion;class pairs separation;classification performance;close class pairs;dimension reduction;homoscedastic Gaussian assumption;iteration procedure;iteration technique;kernel trick;local max-min distance analysis;real data sets;regularized max-min distance analysis;suboptimal classification error rate;synthetic data sets","","0","","14","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are still some challenges in face recognition system which the light changes, expression changes, head movements, accessory occlusion and aging effect are the main issues. For the aging effect, the shape and texture change degrades the performance of face recognition system. Therefore, there are many algorithms focusing on how to simulate the aging face image. In this paper, the modeling of face image is an important procedure for aging simulation. We propose an aging simulation scheme based on the facial muscle model. Then the estimated aging is calculated by the texture variation of a target age from subspace of age groups. Finally, the PCA is applied to face recognition system.

Therefore, this scheme reduces computation load and power consumption dramatically at user side. We have employed back-propagation neural network (BPNN) together with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to appropriately tune seamless handoff and analyze network traffic over time. As a result it takes about 1.597 sec for the seamless handoff between base stations under mobile wireless network.

In order to extract the knowledge and experience from related experts to pick out important evaluation criteria and opinion, this study combines fuzzy theory and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to calculate the weights. After completing weighted calculation of every dimension and indicator, the BSC model is thus established. The findings of this study show that the indicator weightings between and among all the levels are not the same, rather there exists certain amount of differences. The degrees of attention drawing in order of importance among all dimensions are customer, financial, internal process and learning and growth dimension.

In this paper, a model of salient region detection based on local and regional features is presented. Firstly, the image is divided into 8 × 8 sub-blocks. Secondly, the local feature and regional feature of each sub-block are calculated. Local feature which reflects the sub-block's salient character locally is obtained through the calculation of color features in sub-block's 8 neighbors; regional feature which reflects the sub-block's character globally is calculated in the 15 × 15 block size areas which center on each sub-block. In order to avoid losing some detail features in the single scale, the saliency feature is extracted from multi-scale, and the salient sub-block is combined with the above features together as the block's salient value. Secondly, salient edge has been calculated by the contrast of the color values in 4 color channels. Finally, Salient map can be extracted by combining the salient feature and salient edge together. The experimental results show that our model can extract salient objects in images fast and exactly, which can be used in the areas of image retrieval, compression, and so on.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359512","Local feature;Multi-scale;Regional feature;Saliency detection","Abstracts;Feature extraction;Humans;Image edge detection;Manganese;Reliability","feature extraction;image colour analysis;image segmentation","block salient value;color channel;color feature;color value contrast;human visual system;image compression;image division;image retrieval;image saliency detection;local features;regional features;salient edge;salient map extraction;salient region detection;subblock salient character;visual computing model","","0","","23","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most important factors affecting the precision of the performance of a GPS receiver is the relative positioning of satellites to each other. Therefore, it is essential to choose appropriate accessible satellites utilized in the calculation of GPS positions. Optimal subsets of satellites are determined using the least value of their Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP). The most correct method of calculating GPS GDOP uses inverse matrix for all combinations and selecting the lowest ones. However, the inverse matrix method, especially when there are so many satellites, imposes a huge time and power-load on the processor of the GPS navigator. Previous studies have shown that numerical regression on GPS GDOP can get satisfactory results and save many calculation steps. In this paper we apply a new support vector regression machine with parametric-insensitive model (par-v-SVR) to the approximation of GPS GDOP. For a priori chosen v, the par-v-SVR automatically adjusts a flexible tube of arbitrary shape and minimal radius to include the data such that at most a fraction v of the data points lies outside.

Clustering large datasets with GA is extremely slow or even impossible. In this paper, we proposed a new clustering algorithm, called Boosting-Genetic Clustering Algorithm (BGCA). Inspired by boosting algorithms, the BGCA algorithm combines multiple clustering results on a small number of specially selected samples and iteratively improves the accuracy of the inconsistent regions of data points.

A certain threshold of the increment of optical flow residuals is also used to distinguish smoke from other dynamic texture. Secondly, five features that can jointly represent a smoke area, including grayish color, chrominance decrease, edge energy decrease, optical flow orientation diffusion and circularity, are chosen by thorough experiments.

The approach is based on a system identification method known as the impulse response sequence algorithm to fit the fragment coming down curves. The impulse response sequence algorithm generates a state space description of the fragment coming down curves directly from its available input-output data. Comparing to the static mathematical curve model, the dynamic state space model gives more exact fit for all types of fragment coming down curves. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of decomposing the fragment coming down curves into two groups of signal components such as smoothed components and oscillation components. According to the characteristics of each component, the unwanted components are removed to construct the mean-curve with very little or no distortion corresponding to the original signal.

Finally, the intermediate hash is quantized as the final image hash bits with the deterministic adaptive quantizer.

In order to avoid the performance degradation due to hidden nodes, DCF adopts RTS/CTS mechanism to decrease collisions. However, the cost of RTS/CTS sharply increases with the number of wireless nodes. This paper has proposed a cooperative MAC protocol (C-MAC) for time-slotted Ad Hoc networks, which resolves collisions by introducing neighbor nodes information. A scheduling algorithm based on the neighbor node list is used to determine which node can transmit data at a particular time slot. In this paper, we analyze the throughput of IEEE 802.11 DCF and C-MAC in mathematics. An inference is obtained: when the network topology is fixed, the throughput of C-MAC is higher than the one of DCE The simulation results proves this inference. C-MAC significantly improves DCF in terms of increasing throughput by 20%~40%. Moreover, C-MAC can obviously improve the fairness of wireless nodes.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6358987","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6358987","Ad hoc network;Collision resolution;DCF;Neighbor node list;RTS/CTS","Abstracts;Bismuth;Multiaccess communication;Nickel;Protocols","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cooperative communication;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication standards;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 DCF;IEEE 802.11 protocol;RTS-CTS mechanism;ad hoc networks;cooperative MAC protocol;distributed coordination function;hidden nodes;neighbor nodes information;network topology;performance degradation;wireless nodes","","0","","16","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this investigation, the stochastic average monthly temperature profiles for a selected study area were used to determine the effects on crop production. The areas within the study area were spatially scaled to correspond to individual shires within the South West Agricultural region of Western Australia. The temperature was sampled for three selected years of crop production for 2002, 2003 and 2005. The evaluation was carried out using graphical, correlation and data mining regression techniques in order to detect the patterns of crop production.

When point A and point B are parallel pair points, the distance from A to the orientation line of B equates to that from B to the orientation line of A, and still equates to that between A and B, which is based on parallel operator. The circle detection method is constructed by the following four steps: (1) For the image, parallel operator is applied to obtain parallel pair points. (2) Compute the midpoints of the two pair points, get the midpoints energy map and determine the local maxima for locating the potential centers. (3) For each candidate center, compute the radii histogram, and whose value satisfies the threshold restriction is considered as potential radius. (4) For each center and corresponding radius, the number of points on the circle edge and the radius satisfies the threshold restriction is verified as true circle. Synthetic images and natural images are used to test the capability of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that parallel operator has excellent detection accuracy and noise resistance, and the circle detection method has excellent performance for the detection of single circle, multiple circles, concentric circles and partial circles, and also good accuracy despite the presence of different noises.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359506","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359506","Center detection;Circle detection;Concentric circle;Parallel operator;Radius detection;partial circle","Abstracts","edge detection;geometry;natural scenes","circle detection method;circle edge;concentric circles detection;detection accuracy;local maxima determination;midpoints energy map;multiple circles detection;natural images;noise resistance;parallel operator;parallel pair points;partial circles detection;radii histogram computation;single circle detection;synthetic images;threshold restriction","","0","","8","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
