The symbolic features considered here takes completely unordered values. It has been indicated in that in specific classification task, the similarities between these nominal feature values can not be simply considered as either 0 or 1. A GA-based approach has been developed for learning similarity measure of such feature values. However, when the number of features and feature values become larger, the GA-based algorithm's convergence speed obviously slows down, and the accuracy of classification may be also affected. To address this problem, we propose a PSO-based algorithm for learning similarity measure of nominal features and further describe feature importance through the learned similarity measure. The experimental results show that, using the proposed PSO-based algorithm, the convergence speed is much faster than that of GA-based algorithm and the accuracy is also improved. In addition, we also explain that the feature importance defined through the learned similarities is essentially consistent with that in rough sets, and an illustrative example is finally provided.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580536","Feature importance;Particle swarm optimization;Similarity measure;Symbolic feature","Accuracy;Atmospheric measurements;Classification algorithms;Convergence;Image color analysis;Machine learning;Particle measurements","case-based reasoning;convergence;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;rough set theory","GA-based algorithm convergence speed;PSO-based method;case based reasoning classifiers;nominal features;rough sets;similarity measure learning","","0","","8","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two new measures, i.e. confidence degree of feedback and trustworthiness degree of recommending, are introduced to the model. The former represents the confidence of the recommender to its feedback. This measure can be used by the recommender to filter out the feedback with low confidence. The latter is used to weight the recommender's feedback at the trustor's side.

To overcome this disadvantage, this paper presents an adaptive radial basis function network (ARBFN) with kernel shape parameters and derives the learning rules from supervised learning.

Firstly, by using inner-sentence features, two base classifiers corresponding to opinion analysis and relevance estimation tasks, respectively, analyze the opinion and relevance of each sentence in the document.

Considering the strong association between opinionated sentences and topic-relevance sentences, the individual analysis results are refined following a mutual reinforcement mechanism. The updated features are then feed back to the improved classifier to further refine the sentence analysis results. Such circles terminate until the analysis results converge.

In order to improve the accuracy rate and reduce the uncertainty, a new decision-level fusion diagnosis method was proposed based on D-S evidence theory. Firstly, the RNBC models are taken as evidences and the posterior probability values of all fault types as correlation coefficients. Then, all evidences are synthesized by using the combination rule of evidence theory, and consequently, the diagnostic result can be gained by the decision-making method based on the basic probability number. Finally, the validity and engineering practicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by an example of fault diagnosis for diesel engine, and the results show that the proposed method is more effective than the RS method and the BN method and the RBNC method.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581033","D-S evidence theory;Decision-level fusion;Fault diagnosis;Rough Bayesian network classifier","Correlation;Cybernetics;Diesel engines;Fault diagnosis;Machine learning;Uncertainty","belief networks;decision making;fault diagnosis;pattern classification;probability;rough set theory","D-S evidence theory;basic probability number;complex equipment;decision making;decision-level fusion diagnosis;intelligent fault diagnosis;parallel reasoning;practical diagnostic process;rough Bayesian network classifier;rough set;uncertainty factors","","9","","13","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All of this can cause some dies mismatch in the sorting stage, which is never allowed. In order to get integrated match of dies, the position relations between adjacent dies are considered, techniques including diagnosing criterion of position relatives, redundant visual scanning, forward and backtrack algorithm with cross priority are put forward.

When dies arrange in good order, match rate is more than 99.5%, by compassion, that of traditional index method is less than 92%.

With the constant development of machine learning technology, an increasing number of computational methods have been applied to many fields, including text classification, language processing and semantic analysis, etc. This approach is the supplement and breakthrough to the traditional methods of linguistic study. In this paper, Pearson's correlation coefficient, which can reflect the correlative information between two variables, is adopted to analyze the correlation between the frequency and functions of Chinese visual verbs.

The proposed method is based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and it has the following advantages: (1) it can approximate parameters close to the empirical optimum in a single pass through the training examples; (2) it can reduce the computing time by eliminating computation of the inverse of the objective function's Hessian matrix with staggered Aitken acceleration.

For the first time, this paper compares two popular learning frameworks, namely hierarchical support vector machine (SVM) and k nearest neighbor (k-NN) that are applied to a LSHTC task. Experiment results show that the latter outperforms the former in this LSHTC task, which is quite different from the usual results for normal text categorization tasks. Then this paper does a comparative study on different similarity measures and ranking approaches in k-NN framework for LSHTC task. Conclusions can be drawn that k-NN is more appropriate for the LSHTC task than hierarchical SVM and for a specific LSHTC task.

Then one central problem in diagnosis is how the feature selection can influence the predictive accuracy. This problem was addressed in this work and a comparative analysis of seven important different feature selection methods is performed incorporating with learning algorithms. Two machine learning algorithms were used: decision tree (DT) and Bayesian networks (BNs). We utilize feature selection algorithm prior to the learning phase. The conclusions were evaluated by experiments on a clinical sample database for diagnosing apoplexy syndrome.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581014","Feature selection;Quantitative diagnosis;Syndrome differentiation;Traditional Chinese medicine","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Databases;Machine learning;Markov processes","decision trees;medicine","Bayesian network;decision tree;diagnostic model;feature selection algorithm;learning algorithm;traditional Chinese medicine","","1","","11","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic nearest neighbor classifiers suffer from the common problem that the instances used to train the classifier are all stored indiscriminately, and as a result, the required memory storage is huge and response time becomes slow with a large database. In this paper, a new Instances Selection algorithm based on Classification Contribution Function shortly named ISCC is presented. In this algorithm, a function is introduced to evaluate the classification ability of the instances. For each instance, the function considers its contribution to the neighbor instances not only with same class but also with different class. Then an instance with the highest value of Classification Contribution Function is added to the condensed subset and the instances which can be classified correctly are deleted in each iteration. This process is repeated until the subset is no longer getting larger. The time complexity of ISCC is O (in<sup>2</sup>). The experimental results on two artificial databases and some real databases demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. Compared to traditional methods, such as MCS, ICF and ENN, the condensed sets obtained by ISCC is superior in storage and classification accuracy.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581074","ENN;ICF;ISC;Instance Selection;MCS;Nearest Neighbour Rule;Noise","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Learning;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor searches;Noise;Training","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","classification contribution function;instance selection algorithm;memory storage requirement;nearest neighbour classification;time complexity","","0","","22","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
