However, an intrusion detection system (IDS) should always be deployed on security critical applications to defense in depth. Due to the resource constraints, the intrusion detection system for traditional network cannot be used directly in WSNs. Several schemes have been proposed to detect intrusions in wireless sensor networks. But most of them aim on some specific attacks (e.g. selective forwarding) or attacks on particular layers, such as media access layer or routing layer. In this paper, we present a framework of machine learning based intrusion detection system for wireless sensor networks. Our system will not be limited on particular attacks, while machine learning algorithm helps to build detection model from training data automatically, which will save human labor from writing signature of attacks or specifying the normal behavior of a sensor node.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3158-8","10.1109/SUTC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545769","intrusion detection;machine learning;wireless sensor networks","Humans;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Routing;Sensor systems;Training data;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks;Writing","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","intrusion detection;machine learning;security protocols;training data;wireless sensor networks","","16","","28","","","11-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its goal is to find a set of fuzzy rules that form a classification model. Most of the existing fuzzy rule induction methods (e.g., the fuzzy decision trees (FDTs) induction method) focus on searching rules consisting of triangular norms (t-norms) (i.e., and) only, but not triangular conorms (t-conorms) (or) explicitly. This may lead to the omission of generating important rules that involve t-conorms explicitly. This paper proposes a type of tree termed pattern trees (PTs) that makes use of different aggregations, including both t-norms and t-conorms. Like decision trees, PTs are an effective tool for classification applications. This paper discusses the difference between decision trees and PTs, and also shows that the subsethood-based method (SBM) and the weighted-subsethood-based method (WSBM) are two specific cases of PT induction. A novel PT induction method is proposed using similarity measure and fuzzy aggregations. The comparison to other classification methods including SBM, WSBM, C4.5, nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and FDT induction shows that: 1) PTs can obtain high accuracy rates in classifications; 2) PTs are robust to overfltting; and 3) PTs, especially simple pattern trees (SPTs), maintain compact tree structures.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.924348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4505332","Fuzzy classification model;Pattern trees;fuzzy classification model;fuzzy decision trees;fuzzy decision trees (FDTs);pattern trees (PTs)","","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);set theory;trees (mathematics)","decision trees;fuzzy classification;fuzzy-logic-related research;machine learning method;pattern trees induction;similarity measure;simple pattern trees;subsethood-based method;triangular norms;weighted-subsethood-based method","","29","","21","","20080430","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The main objective of this research is making an analysis of software effort estimation to overcome problems related to it: budget and schedule extension. To accomplish this, we propose a model that uses machine learning methods. We evaluate these models on public datasets and data gathered from software organizations in Turkey.

Hence, scalable and accurate detection of peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic is a significant problem for network service providers. Flow-based detection methods employ characteristics of data flows such as the number of packets per flow to classify P2P and non-P2P traffic. Thus, they provide solutions to problems of port-based and signature-based detection such as P2P applications with dynamic ports, updating the signature database and encrypted packets. In this paper, a comparative evaluation of several flow-based P2P traffic detection methods that employ machine learning (ML) techniques is presented. Different from previous work, the effect of network parameters is taken into consideration in our evaluation. Furthermore a new verification approach based on custom-made data is presented which can circumvent the accuracy problems of the previous verification methods that use port-based or signature-based techniques for the accuracy evaluation.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1364-5; POD:978-1-4244-1363-8","10.1109/ISCIS.2007.4456894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4456894","","Bandwidth;Cryptography;Databases;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic","copy protection;copyright;cryptography;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","P2P communications;copyright protected;data flows;encrypted packets;flow-based P2P traffic detection;flow-based detection methods;machine learning algorithms;machine learning techniques;network bandwidth;network service providers;peer-to-peer traffic;quality of service support;signature database;signature-based detection;verification methods","","4","","24","","","7-9 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in large applications, they scale poorly. In many settings there is a large amount of unlabeled data which could be actively chosen by a learner and integrated in the learning procedure. The idea is to improve performance meanwhile reducing costs from data categorization. In this paper we propose an active learning RVM method based on the kernel trick. The underpinning idea is to define a working space between the relevance vectors (RV) initially obtained in a small labeled data set and the new unlabeled examples, where the most informative instances are chosen. By using kernel distance metrics, such a space can be defined and more informative examples can be added to the training set, increasing performance even though the problem dimension is not significantly affected. We detail the proposed method giving illustrative examples in the Reuters-21578 benchmark.

The first is position dependent, the learning phenomenon is implemented by assuming the actual job processing time is a function of its scheduled position. And the second is time dependent, the actual job processing time is the function of the total normal processing time of the previous jobs scheduled in front of it. In many realistic situations, a group processed later consumes more setup time than the same group when it is processed earlier; this phenomenon is known as deteriorating phenomenon. However, both the learning effects and deteriorating effects are relatively unexplored together in the context of group technology. In this paper, we consider two models of single-machine scheduling problems in the context of group technology where setup times are simple linear functions of their starting times and the jobs in the same group have learning effect are considered.

These features not only can be used to filter negative false alarms caused by illumination changes but also to improve recognition rate of the key-frames.

However, despite the significant cost benefits that these methods promise, they have seen a limited success in replacing the traditional specification testing, mainly due to the incurred test error which, albeit small, cannot meet industrial standards. To address this problem, we introduce a neural system that is trained not only to predict the pass/fail labels of devices based on a set of low-cost measurements, as aimed by the previous machine-learning-based test methods, but also to assess the confidence in this prediction. Devices for which this confidence is insufficient are then retested through the more expensive specification testing in order to reach an accurate test decision. Thus, this two-tier test approach sustains the high accuracy of specification testing while leveraging the low cost of machine-learning-based testing. In addition, by varying the desired level of confidence, it enables the exploration of the tradeoff between test cost and test accuracy and facilitates the development of cost-effective test plans. We discuss the structure and the training algorithm of an ontogenic neural network which is embodied in the neural system in the first tier, as well as the extraction of appropriate measurements such that only a small fraction of devices are funneled to the second tier.

Our data consists of polarized color images of scallop and other bivalve larvae (between 2 and 17 days old) collected from the ocean by a shipboard optical imaging system of our design. Larvae of scallops, clams, and oysters are small (100 microns) with few distinguishing features when observed under standard light microscopy. However, the use of polarized light with a full wave retardation plate produces a vivid color, birefringence pattern. The patterns display very subtle differences between species, often not discernable to human observers. We show that a soft-margin support vector machine with Gaussian RBF kernel is a good discriminator on a feature set extracted from Gabor wavelet transforms and color distribution angles of each image. By constraining the Gabor center frequencies to be low, the resulting system can attain classification accuracy in excess of 90% for vertically oriented images, and in excess of 80% for randomly oriented images.","","POD:0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238388","","Birefringence;Color;Displays;Machine learning;Microscopy;Oceans;Optical design;Optical imaging;Optical polarization;Support vector machines","biology computing;feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);oceanography;support vector machines;wavelet transforms","Gabor wavelet transform;biological oceanography;birefringence pattern;bivalve larvae identification;feature set extraction;image color invariants;multiscale texture;optical imaging system;polarized light;support vector machine","","5","","7","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We apply this to yeast TF data with target identifications from ChlP-chip and other sources, and compare performance with Gibbs sampling methods such as BioProspector. We verify that in yeast this method implies well-defined and cross-validated statistical correlations between TF binding and secondary motifs whose binding properties (either with the primary TF or other possible promoters) are not certain, and discuss some implications of this.

We combine the concepts of signal processing, communications, pattern classification and machine learning to make a dynamic use of the spectrum such that the emanated signals do not interfere with the existing ones. Unlike other programs such as the neXt Generation (XG) communications program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), where radio scene analysis is carried out to find the spectrum holes also known as the White space, we make use of the White as well as the Gray space for non-interfering signal transmission. Our assumption is that a learning module will facilitate adaptation in the signal classification process, so that the presence of new types of waveforms can be detected, features that best facilitate classification of the previously and newly identified signals can be determined, and waveforms can be generated by using the basis-set orthogonal to the ones present in the environment. Incremental learning and prediction allow knowledge enhancement as more snap-shots of data are processed, resulting in improved decisions. Use of non-competitive policy set results in zero interference with the already existing signals with a modest increase in the White and Gray space utilization. On the other hand competitive policy set utilizes machine learning to predict the future behavior of the signals which results in more than 90% utilization of spectrum at an expense of some interference due to errors in prediction.","2155-7578;21557578","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1513-7; POD:978-1-4244-1512-0","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455246","Cognitive communications;Gray space;White space;classification;feature extraction;machine learning;policy sets and game theory;signal detection","Computer vision;Image analysis;Interference;Machine learning;Pattern classification;Signal detection;Signal processing;Space technology;Spread spectrum communication;White spaces","","","","7","5","12","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

S. Department of Health and Human Services has recently lunched The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project an overarching goal of understanding the molecular basis of cancer to improve our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent cancer. The prognosis for many cancers could be improved dramatically if they could be detected while still at the microscopic disease stage. We are investigating the possibility of detecting microscopic disease using machine learning approaches based on features derived from gene expression levels and metabolic profiles. We use immunochemistry and QRT-PCR to measure the gene expression profiles from a number of antigens such as cyclin E, P27<sup>KIP1</sup>, FHIT, Ki-67, PCNA, Bax, Bcl-2, P53, Fas, FasL and hTERT in several particular types of neuroendocrine tumors such as pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas; and the adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), adenomas (ACA), and hyperplasia (ACH) in Cushing's syndrome. We provide statistical evidence that, higher expression levels of hTERT, PCNA and Ki-67 etc. are associated with a higher risk that the tumors are malignant or borderline, as opposed to benign. We also investigated whether higher expression levels of the P27<sup>KIP1</sup> and FHIT etc. are associated with a decreased risk of adrenomedullary tumors. While no significant difference was found between cell-arrest antigens such as P27<sup>KIP1</sup> for malignant, borderline, and benign tumors, there was a significant difference between expression levels of such antigens in normal adrenal medulla samples and in adrenomedullary tumors. It follows from a comprehensive statistical analysis that a number of antigens such as hTERT, PCNA and Ki-67 can be considered as cancer markers, while another set of antigens such as P27<sup>KIP1</sup> and FHIT are possible markers for normal tissue. Because more than one marker must be considered to obtai- a classification of cancer or no-cancer, and if cancer, to classify it as malignant, borderline, or benign, we must develop a intelligent decision system using machine learning techniques, including variants of support vector machines, neural networks, decision trees, self-organizing feature maps (SOFM) and recursive maximum contrast trees (RMCT). These variants and algorithms we developed tended to work very well, yielding an average accuracy that was generally in excess of 90%. Our frame work focused on not only different classification schemes and feature selection algorithms but also ensemble methods such as boosting and bagging in an effort to improve upon the accuracy of the individual classifiers. It is evident when all sorts of machine learning and statistically learning techniques are combined appropriately into one integrated intelligent medical decision system, the prediction power can be enhanced significantly. This research has many potential applications, not only in providing an alternative diagnostic tool and a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in malignant transformation, but also in providing information that is useful for treatment planning and cancer prevention.","","POD:978-1-4244-1604-2","10.1109/BIBMW.2007.4425392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4425392","","","biology computing;cancer;learning (artificial intelligence);patient diagnosis;trees (mathematics);tumours","Cushing's syndrome;Ki-67 antigen;PCNA antigen;QRT-PCR;TCGA project;The Cancer Genome Atlas project;adenomas;adrenocortical carcinomas;cancer;diagnosis;gene expression levels;hTERT antigen;hyperplasia;immunochemistry;machine learning;metabolic profiles;microscopic disease detection;neuroendocrine tumors;paragangliomas;pheochromocytomas;recursive maximum contrast trees;self-organizing feature maps;treatment planning","","0","","","","","2-4 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, however, either only one of the objectives is adopted as the cost function or multiple objectives are aggregated to a scalar cost function. This can be mainly attributed to the fact that most conventional learning algorithms can only deal with a scalar cost function. Over the last decade, efforts on solving machine learning problems using the Pareto-based multiobjective optimization methodology have gained increasing impetus, particularly due to the great success of multiobjective optimization using evolutionary algorithms and other population-based stochastic search methods. It has been shown that Pareto-based multiobjective learning approaches are more powerful compared to learning algorithms with a scalar cost function in addressing various topics of machine learning, such as clustering, feature selection, improvement of generalization ability, knowledge extraction, and ensemble generation. One common benefit of the different multiobjective learning approaches is that a deeper insight into the learning problem can be gained by analyzing the Pareto front composed of multiple Pareto-optimal solutions. This paper provides an overview of the existing research on multiobjective machine learning, focusing on supervised learning. In addition, a number of case studies are provided to illustrate the major benefits of the Pareto-based approach to machine learning, e.g., how to identify interpretable models and models that can generalize on unseen data from the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions. Three approaches to Pareto-based multiobjective ensemble generation are compared and discussed in detail. Finally, potentially interesting topics in multiobjective machine learning are suggested.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.919172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4492360","Ensemble;Pareto optimization;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;generalization;machine learning;multiobjective learning;multiobjective optimization;neural networks","Clustering algorithms;Cost function;Evolutionary computation;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pareto analysis;Power generation;Search methods;Stochastic processes;Supervised learning","Pareto optimisation;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence)","Machine Learning:;Pareto-based multiobjective learning;evolutionary algorithms;multiobjective optimization;scalar cost function","","101","","94","","","May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since the basic ideas of EP and EDAs are quite different, it is possible to make them reinforce each other. In this paper, we present a hybrid evolutionary framework to make use of both the ideas of EP and EDAs through introducing a mini estimation operator into EP's search cycle. Unlike previous EDAs that use probability density function (PDF), the estimation mechanism used in the proposed framework is the k-nearest neighbor estimation which can perform better with relative small amount of training samples.

In this work we describe first a method for monitoring and modeling of performance degradation in SOA applications, particularly application servers. This method works for a large class of the aging processes caused by resource depletion (e.g. memory leaks). It can be deployed non-intrusively in a production environment, under arbitrary service request distributions. Based on this schema we investigate in the second part of the paper how machine learning (classification) algorithms can be used for proactive detection of performance degradation or sudden drops caused by aging. We leverage the predictive power of these algorithms with several techniques to make the measurement-based aging models more adaptive and more robust against transient failures. We evaluate several state-of-the-art classification methods for their accuracy and computational efficiency in this scenario. The studies are performed on a data set generated by a TPC-W benchmark instrumented with a memory leak injector. The results show that the probing method yields accurate aging models with low overhead and the machine learning approach gives statistically significant short-term predictions of degrading application performance. Both approaches can be used directly to fight aging via adaptive software rejuvenation (restart of the application), for operator alerting, or for short-term capacity planning.","1542-1201;15421201","POD:978-1-4244-2065-0","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575113","","Aging;Application software;Computer crashes;Condition monitoring;Degradation;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Predictive models;Service oriented architecture;Software performance","learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;software architecture;software performance evaluation;storage management;system monitoring","SOA applications;adaptive software rejuvenation;application crash;application servers;capacity planning;machine learning;memory leak injector;memory leaks;nonintrusive modeling;performance degradation;probing method;resource depletion;service request distribution;software aging prediction;system monitoring;transient failure","","23","","18","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applications running on these networks can specify suitable service classes to their connections or flows. The flows are then treated according to their service classes. However, current Internet applications are still designed based on best-effort scheme and, therefore, cannot benefit from QoS support from the network. An automatic flow classification framework, which can automatically classify non QoS-aware flows or legacy flows, has been proposed in our earlier work [2]. In this paper, we extend our framework by introducing new features that can be effectively used to classify legacy flows. The simplicity of these features allows the data to be collected in real-time. No packet-level data are required. Furthermore, the framework is evaluated using multiple data sets from different users. The results show that our framework works extremely well in general and it can be operated independently from any applications, networks or even machine learning algorithms. Average correctness up to 98.82% is achieved when the framework is used to learn and classify unseen flows from the same user.

A P-type and model inversion learning function are both applied to the extrusion process, a system that has nonlinear dynamics and no readily available volumetric flowrate sensor. Theoretical and experimental results show that the nominal system is first order with a pure time delay. Both P-type and model inversion ILC improve the dynamics, with both systems providing better reference tracking. The ILC compensates for the unmodeled nonlinearities, realizing a reduction of RMS error to less than 20% of the initial value for the model inversion approach.

For example, a state-of-the-art large margin classifier, the support vector machine (SVM), considers data only locally, while another significant model, the minimax probability machine (MPM), focuses on building the decision hyperplane exclusively based on the global information. As a major contribution, we show that SVM yields the same solution as M<sup>4</sup> when data satisfy certain conditions, and MPM can be regarded as a relaxation model of M<sup>4</sup>. Moreover, based on our proposed local and global view of data, another popular model, the linear discriminant analysis, can easily be interpreted and extended as well. We describe the M<sup>4</sup> model definition, provide a geometrical interpretation, present theoretical justifications, and propose a practical sequential conic programming method to solve the optimization problem.

We develop two machine learning-based techniques for efficiently exploring the processor design space. We observe that these techniques result in multi-core processors whose performance is comparable (within 1%) to a processor design that requires an exhaustive exploration of the design space. These techniques often take orders of magnitude (a factor of 3800 at the minimum) less time for coming up with these processors. The benefits are up to 13% over intelligent search techniques that have been adapted to do multi-core design space exploration.

However, these techniques require that the classification algorithm is trained with examples of the traffic generated by the applications to be identified, possibly on the link where the classifier will operate.This is an important issue, as a pre-trained portable classifier would greatly facilitate the deployment and management of the classification infrastructure.The new contribution of this paper is a comparison of different sets of per-flow attributes that can be used for flow classification and the indication of which ones are more effective when the trained classifier is operated on a different link.","2162-2108;21622108","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3329-2","10.1109/SECURWARE.2008.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4622599","application identification;machine learning;traffic classification","Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Hidden Markov models;Information analysis;Information security;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Payloads","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","early application identification;interarrival times;intrusion detection;packet lengths;policy enforcement systems;portability;traffic flow;trained machine learning classifiers","","2","","17","","","25-31 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rule-based and machine learning approaches represent the extremes in a continuum of approaches. Each step in the shape recognition process may include algorithms that fall anywhere on this continuum or fusion that combines the results of multiple algorithms. Determining an appropriate approach for each step is generally determined by the availability of ground-truthed data for training and testing, and how much of the analysis can be automated. If analysis is based on experience and a sufficient number of ground-truthed exemplars are available then a machine learning approach is indicated.

In particular, we suggest two fundamental principles to achieve human-level machine learning: continuity (forming a lifelong memory continuously) and glocality (organizing a plastic structure of localized micromodules connected globally). We then propose a multimodal memory game as a research platform to study cognitive learning architectures and algorithms, where the machine learner and two human players question and answer about the scenes and dialogues after watching the movies.

Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our method surpasses that of previous learning approaches and is comparable to the state-of-the-art for pixel-based stereo. Moreover, our method achieves good results even when trained on different image sets, in contrast with the common practice of hand tuning to specific benchmark images.

Identifying targeting genes that miRNAs regulate is important for understanding their specific biological functions. Usually, miRNAs down-regulate target genes through binding to the complementary sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the targets. Since the binding of the miRNAs of animals is not a perfect one-to-one match with the complementary sites of their targets, it is difficult to find targets of animal miRNAs by accessing their alignment to the 3' UTRs of potential targets. More sophisticated computational approaches are desirable and have been proposed as a result. The most popular algorithms include TargetScan, miRanda, and PicTar. However, they share similar methodology and are restricted by the human observation of conserved nature of miRNAs and their targets. In this article, we develop a statistical learning based approach that uses support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier to predict miRNA targets. SVM have been applied in many fields such as pattern recognition, computational biology, and medical image analysis. With SVM, information is gained automatically from relevant data and therefore human bias can be removed in the decision process.","2150-3001;21503001","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2372-9; POD:978-1-4244-2371-2","10.1109/GENSIPS.2008.4555655","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555655","","Animals;Biomedical imaging;Computational biology;Humans;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;RNA;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","biology computing;genetics;organic compounds;pattern classification;support vector machines","SVM classifier;computational biology;machine learning;miRNA gene down regulation;miRNA gene regulate;miRNA target prediction;microRNA;nucleotide noncoding RNA;post transcriptional regulatory functions;statistical learning based approach;support vector machine;target gene untranslated region","","0","","8","","","8-10 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Loss classification in optical burst switching networks using machine learning techniques: improving the performance of TCP","A. Jayaraj; T. Venkatesh; C. S. R. Murthy","Dept. of Comput.

Madras, Chennai","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","20080805","2008","26","6","45","54","Optical burst switching (OBS) is considered as a contending technology for the core of the Internet in future. However, due to lack of the buffers, losses occur due to contention among simultaneously arriving bursts at the core nodes. Contention losses do not necessarily indicate a situation of congestion in the network. Thus differentiation (classification) of losses is essential in many applications to avoid false identification of congestion. In this paper, we propose a loss classification technique for the OBS networks based on machine learning techniques. We devise a new measure to differentiate between congestion and contention losses, which is derived from the observed losses, called the number of bursts between failures (NBBF). We observe that the NBBF follows a Gaussian distribution with different parameters for contention and congestion losses. This feature is used in differentiation. We use both a supervised learning technique (hidden Markov model (HMM)) and an unsupervised learning technique (expectation maximization (EM) clustering) on the observed losses and classify them into a set of states (clusters) after which an algorithm differentiates between the congestion and contention losses. We also demonstrate the use of loss differentiation in improving the performance of transport control protocol (TCP) over OBS networks. We modify congestion control mechanism of TCP suitably to arrive at two variants of TCP, HMM-TCP and EM-TCP. Their performance is compared with TCP NewReno, TCP SACK, and Burst TCP (X. Yu et al., Mar. 2004). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the loss classification technique in different network scenarios.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSACOCN.2008.033508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4588332","","Gaussian distribution;Hidden Markov models;Internet;Loss measurement;Machine learning;Optical buffering;Optical burst switching;Optical losses;Performance loss;Supervised learning","Gaussian distribution;Internet;expectation-maximisation algorithm;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);optical burst switching;optical fibre networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication congestion control;transport protocols","Gaussian distribution;Internet;TCP;congestion control mechanism;expectation maximization clustering;false identification;hidden Markov model;loss classification technique;machine learning techniques;number of bursts between failures;optical burst switching networks;supervised learning technique;transport control protocol","","6","","18","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Examples will be given ranging from engineering design, machine learning, to biological systems to show how Pareto-optimality can make a difference in analyzing these systems. The first example we will discuss is the aerodynamic design optimization of turbine blades, where energy efficiency in terms of pressure loss as well as the variation of pressure distribution must be minimized. One additional difficulty in aerodynamic design optimization is that the quality of candidate designs must be assessed by performing computational fluid dynamics analysis, which is very time consuming. To reduce computation time, computational techniques like parallel computation, and machine learning techniques, such as meta-modeling can be employed.Surprisingly interesting results will also be achieved when the concept of Pareto-optimality is applied to machine learning. Two cases will be provided to illustrate this idea. In the first case, we show how Pareto-based approach can address neural network regularization more elegantly, through which deeper insights into the problem can be gained. In the second case, we show that analysis of the Pareto-optimal solutions will help determine the optimal number of clusters in data clustering, which again shown how the Pareto front can disclose additional knowledge about the problem at hand. The final example is concerned with tradeoffs in simulated evolution of genetic representation. It has been argued that robustness is critical for biological evolution, because without certain degree of robustness to mutations, it is impossible for evolution to create new functionalities. Therefore, evolution must find representations that are sufficiently robust yet have the potential to innovate. Examples will be- given to show that such tradeoff does exist in evolving both a stationary genotype-phenotype mapping, and also a gene regulatory network described by a random Boolean network.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1613-4; POD:978-1-4244-1612-7","10.1109/GEFS.2008.4484555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4484555","","Adaptive systems;Aerodynamics;Biological systems;Concurrent computing;Design engineering;Design optimization;Evolution (biology);Machine learning;Pareto analysis;Robustness","Pareto optimisation;adaptive systems","Pareto-optimality;adaptive systems;aerodynamic design optimization;biological systems;computational fluid dynamics analysis;data clustering;engineering design;genetic representation;genotype-phenotype mapping;machine learning;turbine blades","","0","","","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional approaches such as port-based and payload-based identification are becoming increasingly difficult with many new applications (e.g. P2P) using dynamic port numbers, masquerading techniques, and encryption to avoid detection. An alternative approach is to classify traffic by exploiting the distinctive characteristics of flow statistics. We present here a traffic classification scheme based on machine learning (ML). The performance impact of the dataset size, feature selection and ML algorithm selection is demonstrated by experiments. The genetic algorithm based feature selection can dramatically reduce the ML learning and modeling time with less decrease or even a bit increase in classification accuracy. The chosen ML algorithms: TAN, C4.5, NBTree, RandomForest and distance weighted KNN, can reach high classification accuracy. Typically, C4.5 and RandomForest are superior to other ML algorithms in computational complexity. Besides, experiments show that the size of data set would impact on the classification performance, and tuning dataset's size could meet the requirements of specific applications.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1009-5; POD:978-1-4244-1008-8","10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469372","Feature Selection;Machine Learning (ML);Traffic classification","Cryptography;Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;computer network management;genetic algorithms;quality of service;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic classification;Internet traffic identification;QoS provision;feature selection;genetic algorithm;machine learning;network management;network planning;payload-based identification;security monitoring","","6","","6","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dedicated to the application of face model fitting, this paper proposes to consider a multi-band image representation that indicates the facial components, from which a large set of image features is computed. Since it is not possible to manually formulate an objective function that considers this large amount of features, we apply a Machine Learning framework to construct them. This automatic approach is capable of considering the large amount of features provided and yield highly accurate objective functions for face model fitting.

The determination function involves two assessments; one counts the number of each sign of SVM output and the other compares the distance values. The sign of SVM output is generally used to classify target objects, but the distance SVM output also represents important information. An experiment that assesses SVM performance for Japanese accent validity shows that its accuracy is 81%.

With the industry already shifting from multicore to many-core microprocessors, software developers must extract more thread-level parallelism from applications. Unfortunately, low power-efficiency and diminishing returns in performance remain major obstacles with many cores. Poor interaction between software and hardware, and bottlenecks in shared hardware structures often prevent scaling to many cores, even in applications where a high degree of parallelism is potentially available. In some cases, throwing additional cores at a problem may actually harm performance and increase power consumption. Better use of otherwise limitedly beneficial cores by software components such as hypervisors and operating systems can improve system-wide performance and reliability, even in cases where power consumption is not a main concern. In response to these observations, we evaluate an approach to throttle concurrency in parallel programs dynamically. We throttle concurrency to levels with higher predicted efficiency from both performance and energy standpoints, and we do so via machine learning, specifically artificial neural networks (ANNs). One advantage of using ANNs over similar techniques previously explored is that the training phase is greatly simplified, thereby reducing the burden on the end user. Using machine learning in the context of concurrency throttling is novel. We show that ANNs are effective for identifying energy-efficient concurrency levels in multithreaded scientific applications, and we do so using physical experimentation on a state-of-the-art quad-core Xeon platform.","1552-5244;15525244","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1388-1; POD:978-1-4244-1387-4","10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4629274","","Application software;Computer industry;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Machine learning;Microprocessors;Multicore processing;Power system reliability","concurrency control;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;natural sciences computing","Intel quad-core processor;artificial neural network;energy-efficient concurrency level Identification;machine learning;multicore microprocessor;multithreaded scientific application;parallel program","","7","","15","","","17-20 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The major contribution of the paper is the original association of an AdaBoost algorithm to select the relevant weak classifiers, followed by a SVM like classifier for which input data are given by the selected weak classifiers. Kernel based machine learning provides non-linear separator into the weak classifier space while standard AdaBoost gives a linear one.
