"Machine learning for predictive auto-tuning with boosted regression trees","J. Bergstra; N. Pinto; D.

A family of methods known collectively as “auto-tuning” has emerged to address this challenge. Two major approaches to auto-tuning are empirical and model-based: empirical autotuning is a generic but slow approach that works by measuring runtimes of candidate implementations, model-based auto-tuning predicts those runtimes using simplified abstractions designed by hand. We show that machine learning methods for non-linear regression can be used to estimate timing models from data, capturing the best of both approaches. A statistically-derived model offers the speed of a model-based approach, with the generality and simplicity of empirical auto-tuning. We validate our approach using the filterbank correlation kernel described in Pinto and Cox [2012], where we find that 0.1 seconds of hill climbing on the regression model (“predictive auto-tuning”) can achieve almost the same speed-up as is brought by minutes of empirical auto-tuning. Our approach is not specific to filterbank correlation, nor even to GPU kernel auto-tuning, and can be applied to almost any templated-code optimization problem, spanning a wide variety of problem types, kernel types, and platforms.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2633-9; POD:978-1-4673-2632-2","10.1109/InPar.2012.6339587","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6339587","","Correlation;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Kernel;Libraries;Optimization;Regression tree analysis","channel bank filters;learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems;regression analysis;trees (mathematics)","boosted regression trees;candidate implementation runtime measurement;empirical autotuning;filterbank correlation kernel;machine learning;model-based approach;model-based autotuning;multicore architectures;nonlinear regression;predictive autotuning;statistically-derived model;templated-code optimization problem;time 0.1 s;timing model estimation","","11","","44","","","13-14 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Managing such a large repository is a challenging job. Priority of a bug tells that how important and urgent it is for us to fix. Priority of a bug can be classified into 5 levels from PI to P5 where PI is the highest and P5 is the lowest priority. Correct prioritization of bugs helps in bug fix scheduling/assignment and resource allocation. Failure of this will result in delay of resolving important bugs. This requires a bug prediction system which can predict the priority of a newly reported bug. Cross project validation is also an important concern in empirical software engineering where we train classifier on one project and test it for prediction on other projects. In the available literature, we found very few papers for bug priority prediction and none of them dealt with cross project validation. In this paper, we have evaluated the performance of different machine learning techniques namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Network (NNet) in predicting the priority of the newly coming reports on the basis of different performance measures. We performed cross project validation for 76 cases of five data sets of open office and eclipse projects.

Multilayer perception classifier is exploited to classify connected components to the relevant class of text. A voting scheme is then applied to refine the resulting segmentation and produce the final classification. In contrast to state-of-the-art segmentation approaches, this method is independent of block segmentation, as well as pixel level analysis.

This problem is computationally hard, and there are very few automated approaches for its solution. To solve this problem we propose an algorithm, called Circuit-Decomposition Engine (CDE), that is based on learning decision trees, and uses a greedy approach for function learning. We empirically demonstrate that CDE, when given a library of different component types, can learn the function of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) Boolean representations and synthesize circuit structure using the input library. We compare the structure of the synthesized circuits with that of well-known circuits using a range of circuit similarity metrics.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4681-8; POD:978-1-4673-4682-5","10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377134","","Adders;Algorithm design and analysis;Boolean functions;Decision trees;Educational institutions;Libraries;Logic gates","Boolean functions;decision trees;electronic engineering computing;greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);logic design;multivalued logic","CDE;DNF Boolean representations;circuit decomposition engine;circuit similarity metrics;components collection;developing circuits;disjunctive normal form Boolean representations;function learning;greedy approach;learning decision trees;machine learning-based circuit synthesis;multilevel logic synthesis;objective function","","0","","13","","","14-17 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fast progress in high-throughput technologies and the production of large amounts of data enable the discovery of essential proteins at the system level by analyzing Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks, and replacing biological or chemical experiments. Furthermore, additional gene-level annotation information, such as Gene Ontology (GO) terms, helps to detect essential proteins with higher accuracy. Various centrality algorithms have been used to determine essential proteins in a PPI network, and, recently motif centrality GO, which is based on network motifs and GO terms, works best in detecting essential proteins in a Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI network, compared to other centrality algorithms. However, each centrality algorithm contributes to the detection of essential proteins with different properties, which makes the integration of them a logical next step. In this paper, we construct a new feature space, named CENT-ING-GO consisting of various centrality measures and GO terms, and provide a computational approach to predict essential proteins with various machine learning techniques. The experimental results show that CENT-ING-GO feature space improves performance over the INT-GO feature space in previous work by Acencio and Lemke in 2009. We also demonstrate that pruning a PPI with informative GO terms can improve the prediction performance further.","","","10.1109/TST.2012.6374366","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6374366","CENT-ING-GO;Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI);centrality algorithm;essential protein;gene ontology;machine learning;motif centrality GO;network motif","Extraterrestrial measurements;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Ontologies;Prediction algorithms;Proteins","","","","6","","","","","Dec. 2012","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

The IDEAL project uses a variety of IT methods to investigate whether, and in which social groups, feedback of personalised, household-specific and behaviour-specific information results in greater reduction in energy use than overall consumption information reported by Smart Meters. It is a sociotechnical study, concentrated on existing housing, with a strong social science component and an experimental design that looks at income levels and household composition as primary factors. Temperature and humidity data related to behaviour is gathered using a small number of wireless sensors in the home, together with data on weather, building factors and household composition. This data is streamed over the internet to servers where it is analysed using Bayesian machine-learning methods to extract household-specific behaviours in near-realtime. Information on the cost, carbon content and amount of energy used for specific behaviours is reported back to the householders via a dedicated wireless tablet. This interactive content is automatically generated using multimedia methods based on natural language generation techniques. The project is in its design phase, with the main project planned (and funded) to run 2013-2016. It is anticipated to demonstrate whether such low-cost sensing, analysis and feedback is significantly more effective than standard Smart Meters in reducing demand, and a business opportunity for green service organisations.","","Electronic:978-3-901882-46-3; POD:978-1-4673-2031-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388019","building energy efficiency;demand reduction;human-computer interaction;machine learning;natural language generation","Electricity;Gas detectors;Heating;Humidity;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;belief networks;building management systems;demand side management;green computing;humidity sensors;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);media streaming;meteorology;natural language processing;notebook computers;socio-economic effects;temperature sensors;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian machine learning method;IDEAL project;IT methods;Internet;automatic interactive content generation;behaviour-specific information;building factors;business opportunity;carbon content;cost information;data streaming;domestic energy demand;energy demand reduction;energy use reduction;green service organisations;household composition;household-specific behaviours;household-specific information;humidity data;income levels;low-cost analysis;low-cost sensing;multimedia content generation;natural language generation techniques;personalised information;social groups;sociotechnical study;temperature data;weather data;wireless sensors;wireless tablet","","0","","15","","","4-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that a 90%-accurate model can be built from a training set of merely 500 CRPs, and that 5000 CRPs are sufficient to perfectly model the PUFs. To study the implications of these attacks, there is need for a new methodology to assess the security of PUFs suffering from modeling. We propose such a methodology and apply it to our machine learning results, yielding strict bounds on the usability of Arbiter PUFs.

With a machine learning-based methodology, latent correlations in the joint process-test space could be identified, enabling dramatic cost reductions throughout the manufacturing process. To realize such a solution, this work addresses three distinct problems within semiconductor manufacturing: (1) Reduce test cost for analog and RF devices, as testing can account for up to 50% of the overall production cost of an IC; (2) Develop algorithms for post-production performance calibration, enabling higher yields and optimal power-performance; and, (3) Develop algorithms for spatial modeling of sparsely sampled wafer test parameters.

Many existing methods can provide lots of candidate subgraphs. So we focused on how to classify the protein complexes from the subgraphs by considering the fuzzy attribute of PPI. We experimented with two datasets of size 10,371 and 986, each containing 493 positive protein complexes from MIPS and TAP-MS datasets. We compared the performance of GAFNB with Naïve Bayes (NB).

The FSE data were collected using two different sampling techniques, namely Vortis and pitfall. The corroboration of the initial Vortis food web, generated by machine learning, was performed manually by the domain experts. However, manual corroboration of hypothetical trophic links is difficult and requires significant amounts of time. In this paper we review the method and the main results on machine learning of trophic links. We study common trophic links from Vortis and pitfall data.

A noticeable effort has been made to move the data management systems into MapReduce parallel processing environments such as Hadoop and Pig. Nevertheless these systems lack the features of advanced machine learning and statistical analysis. Frame-works such as Mahout on top of Hadoop support machine learning but their implementations are at the preliminary stage. For example Mahout does not provide Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms and it is difficult to use. On the other hand traditional statistical software tools such as R containing comprehensive statistical algorithms for advanced analysis are widely used. But such software can only run on a single computer and therefore it is not scalable. In this paper we propose an integrated solution RPig which takes the advantages of R (for machine learning and statistical analysis capabilities) and parallel data processing capabilities of Pig. The RPig framework offers a scalable advanced data analysis solution for machine learning and statistical analysis. Analysis jobs can be easily developed with RPig script in high level languages. We describe the design implementation and an eclipse-based RPigEditor for the RPig framework. Using application scenarios from the Telecom domain we show the usage of RPig and how the framework can significantly reduce the development effort. The results demonstrate the scalability of our framework and the simplicity of deployment for analysis jobs.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4510-1; POD:978-1-4673-4511-8; USB:978-1-4673-4509-5","10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6427480","Analytic;Big data;Design;MapReduce;Pig;R","","authoring languages;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;software tools;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing","Hadoop;MapReduce parallel processing environments;RPig script;Telecom domain;advanced statistical functionality;comprehensive statistical algorithms;data management systems;eclipse-based RPigEditor;high level languages;machine learning;scalable advanced data analysis solution;scalable framework;statistical analysis;statistical software tools","","5","","22","","","3-6 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main function of Intrusion Detection System is to protect the resources from threats. It analyzes and predicts the behaviours of users, and then these behaviours will be considered an attack or a normal behaviour. We use Rough Set Theory (RST) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect network intrusions. First, packets are captured from the network, RST is used to pre-process the data and reduce the dimensions. The features selected by RST will be sent to SVM model to learn and test respectively. The method is effective to decrease the space density of data.

We employ brain source localization (BSL) on the EEG signals to extract source waveforms from specified regions of the brain. A subset of 8 features is selected from a large set of candidate features (consisting of spectral coherences between all identified source waveforms at multiple frequencies) that discriminate (by means of a classifier) between the pre- and post-treatment data for the schizophrenics (SCZ) most responsive to CLZ. We show these same selected features also discriminate between pre-treatment most responsive SCZ and healthy volunteers (HV), but not after treatment. Of note, these same features discriminate the least responsive SCZ from HV both pre- and post-treatment. This analysis suggests that the net beneficial effects of CLZ in SCZ are reflected in a normalization of P300 brain-source generators.","1094-687X;1094687X","Electronic:978-1-4577-1787-1; POD:978-1-4244-4119-8; USB:978-1-4244-4120-4","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6347339","Brain source localization;EEG signals;P300 evoked potentials;clozapine treatment;machine learning;schizophrenia","Band pass filters;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Medical treatment;Scalp;Training","bioelectric potentials;diseases;drugs;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;psychology","BSL;CLZ treatment induced brain changes;EEG signals;P300 brain-source generators;P300 evoked potentials;P300 responses;QEEG data;brain source localization;clozapine therapy effects;machine learning approach;medication resistant schizophrenia;quantitative electroencephalography;schizophrenia pathophysiology;source waveform extraction","Antipsychotic Agents;Artificial Intelligence;Clozapine;Evoked Potentials;Humans","0","","16","","","Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

UHF systems are designed for large bulk read processes as opposed to sequential reads typical for optical systems (e.g., Barcode) or short range low frequency systems such as NFC.

However, such information is not available in UHF-based RFID technology. This paper describes a novel method ?? based on radar technology and machine learning algorithms ?? that can estimate position of RFID tags using the UHF signals reflected from the tags.

K-complex is an indicator for the sleep stage 2. However, due to the ambiguity of the translation of the medical standards into a computer-based procedure, reliability of automated K-complex detection from the EEG wave is still far from expectation. More specifically, there are some significant barriers to the research of automatic K-complex detection. First, there is no adequate description of K-complex that makes it difficult to develop automatic detection algorithm. Second, human experts only provided the label for whether a whole EEG segment contains K-complex or not, rather than individual labels for each subsegment. These barriers render most pattern recognition algorithms inapplicable in detecting K-complex. In this paper, we attempt to address these two challenges, by designing a new feature extraction method that can transform visual features of the EEG wave with any length into mathematical representation and proposing a hybrid-synergic machine learning method to build a K-complex classifier. The tenfold cross-validation results indicate that both the accuracy and the precision of this proposed model are at least as good as a human expert in K-complex detection.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2191775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6190762","EEG;K-complex;multi-instance learning (MIL);sleep disorder","Biomedical monitoring;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Sleep;Visualization","electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;signal classification","EEG wave;computer-based procedure;hybrid-synergic machine learning method;k-complex classifier;k-complex detection;mathematical representation;medical standards;sleep disorder diagnostics process;sleep stage identification","","5","","46","","20120426","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Lots of computing time would be spent on tuning parameters. In order to reduce this workload, we proposed using L-1 SVM instead of L-2 SVM for LUPI in our previous work. Different from LUPI with L-2 SVM, which is formulated as quadratic programming, LUPI with L-1 SVM is essentially a linear programming and is computationally much cheaper. On this basis, we discuss how to employ the wisdom from teachers better and more flexible by LUPI with L-1 SVM in this paper. By introducing kernels, an extended L-1 SVM model, which is still a linear programming, is proposed. With the help of nonlinear kernels, the new model allows the privileged information be explored in a transformed feature space instead of the original data domain.

Furthermore, the incompliance to the treatment because of its high cost and related unfavorable effects makes its prediction of paramount importance. By using machine-learning techniques, a significantly accurate predictive model constructed to predict Egyptian patients' response based on their clinical and biochemical data. The model uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Trees (DT) to achieve this goal. Two-hundred patients treated with Peg-IFN and RBV, 83 responders (41%), and 117 non-responders (59%) retrospectively studied to extract informative features and train the Neural Networks and Decision Trees. Optimization was done by using six different Neural Network architectures, starting with an input layer of 12 neurons, a hidden layer of 70 to 180 neurons and an output layer containing a single neuron. For decision Trees (DTs), the CART classification algorithm was used. Six DTs with two classes, pruning levels of 9, 11, 13, and 17, and nodes from 45 to 61 were investigated. Among the 12 features in the study, the most statistically significant informative features were the patient's Histology activity index, fibrosis, viral-load, Alfa-feta protein and albumin. Validation of the models on a 20% test set was then performed. The best and average accuracy for the ANN and DT models were 0.76 and 0.69, and 0.80 and 0.72 respectively.

Also biological experiment only can find a small amount of miRNAs. Computational approaches have become another important way of miRNA prediction, especially machine learning approaches. miRNA prediction based on machine learning approaches requires a lot of positive and negative samples.

In the paper, we present the complete approach, emphasizing the use of CBR techniques, namely the structural case base, built with annotated MultiNet graphs, and corresponding graph similarity measures. We cover a priori relations to experienced answer candidates for former questions. We describe the adequate structuring of the case base and develop appropriate similarity measures. Finally we integrate CBR into an existing framework for answer validation and reranking that also includes logical answer validation and a shallow linguistic validation, using a learning-to-rank approach for the final answer ranking based on CBR-related features.

The Center for the Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS) Storm Scale Ensemble Forecast (SSEF) system is a promising method of providing high-resolution forecasts of the intensity and uncertainty in precipitation forecasts. The SSEF incorporates multiple models with varied parameterization scheme combinations and produces forecasts every 4 km over the continental US. The SSEF precipitation forecasts exhibit significant negative biases and placement errors. In order to correct these issues, multiple machine learning algorithms have been applied to the SSEF precipitation forecasts to correct the forecasts using the NSSL National Mosaic and Multisensor QPE (NMQ) grid as verification. The 2010 SSEF was used for training. Two levels of post-processing are performed. In the first, probabilities of any precipitation are determined and used to find optimal thresholds for the precipitation areas. Then, three types of forecasts are produced in those areas. First, the probability of the 1-hour accumulated precipitation exceeding a threshold is predicted with random forests, logistic regression, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). Second, deterministic forecasts based on a correction from the ensemble mean are made with linear regression, random forests, and MARS. Third, fixed probability interval forecasts are made with quantile regressions and quantile regression forests. Models are generated from points sampled from the western, central, and eastern sections of the domain. Verification statistics and case study results show improvements in the reliability and skill of the forecasts compared to the original ensemble while controlling for the over-prediction of the precipitation areas and without sacrificing smaller scale details from the model runs.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-4626-9; Electronic:978-1-4673-4627-6; POD:978-1-4673-4625-2","10.1109/CIDU.2012.6382199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6382199","","Logistics;Machine learning algorithms;Mars;Predictive models;Probability;Rain;Storms","geophysics computing;lead compounds;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;regression analysis;splines (mathematics);trees (mathematics);weather forecasting","CAPS SSEF system;Center for the Analysis and Prediction of Storms;MARS;NMQ grid;NSSL National Mosaic and Multisensor QPE grid;Storm Scale Ensemble Forecast system;complex multiscale interaction;continental US;deterministic forecast;ensemble mean;fixed probability interval forecast;forecasting problem;high-resolution forecast;linear regression;logistic regression;machine learning algorithm;machine learning enhancement;multivariate adaptive regression splines;negative bias;parameterization scheme;placement error;precipitation area optimal threshold;precipitation formation;precipitation over-prediction;quantile regression forest;random forest;storm scale ensemble precipitation forecast;verification statistics","","2","","23","","","24-26 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One widely available metric of aerosol abundance is the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The AOD is the integrated light extinction coefficient over a vertical atmospheric column of unit cross section, which represents the extent to which the aerosols in that vertical profile prevent the transmission of light by absorption or scattering. The comparison between the AOD measured from the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) system and the satellite MODIS instruments at 550 nm shows that there is a bias between the two data products. We performed a comprehensive search exploring possible factors which may be contributing to the inter-instrumental bias between MODIS-Aqua land data set and AERONET. The analysis used several measured variables, including the MODIS AOD, as input in order to train a neural network in regression mode to predict the AERONET AOD values. This not only allowed us to obtain an estimate, but also allowed us to infer the optimal sets of variables that played an important role in the prediction. In addition, we applied machine learning to infer the global abundance of ground level PM2.5 from the AOD data and other ancillary satellite and meteorology products. This research is part of our goal to provide air quality information, which can also be useful for global epidemiology studies.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-4626-9; Electronic:978-1-4673-4627-6; POD:978-1-4673-4625-2","10.1109/CIDU.2012.6382197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6382197","","Aerosols;Artificial neural networks;Azimuth;Correlation;MODIS;Sea measurements","aerosols;air pollution measurement;atmospheric light propagation;atmospheric techniques;geophysics computing;health hazards;learning (artificial intelligence);light absorption;light scattering;regression analysis;remote sensing","AERONET AOD value prediction;AERONET system;MODIS AOD;MODIS-Aqua land data set;aerosol abundance estimation;aerosol optical depth;aerosol particles;air quality information;bias correction;data-driven machine learning;global abundance;global epidemiology studies;ground-based aerosol robotic network;harmful health effects;integrated light extinction coefficient;inter-instrumental bias;light absorption;light scattering;light transmission prevention;meteorology products;neural network training;public health;regression mode;remote sensing;satellite MODIS instruments;vertical atmospheric column","","0","","25","","","24-26 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, automated QoS management for interactive traffic flows requires quick and timely classification well before the flows finish. Also, interactive flows are often long-lived and should be continuously monitored during their lifetime. We propose to achieve this by using statistics derived from sub-flows—a small number of most recent packets taken at any point in a flow's lifetime. Then, the ML classifier must be trained on a set of sub-flows, and we investigate different sub-flow selection strategies. We also propose to augment training datasets so that classification accuracy is maintained even when a classifier mixes up client-to-server and server-to-client directions for applications exhibiting asymmetric traffic characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with the Naive Bayes and C4.5 Decision Tree ML algorithms, for the identification of first-person-shooter online game and VoIP traffic. Our results show that we can classify both applications with up to 99% Precision and 95% Recall within less than 1 s.

Thus, it lowers the requirement for the enlargement of lens and the resolution of charge-coupled device; therefore, the cost of inspecting instrument can be relatively reduced. Our method mainly includes two procedures: First, the statistical shape models of microdrill bit are built to get the shape subspace, and then the phase identification is performed in the shape subspace using some pattern recognition techniques. In this paper, we compared the performance of two statistical model methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminate analysis, together with three classifiers, support vector machines (SVMs), neural networks, and <i>k</i>-nearest neighbors, respectively, for phase identification of microdrill bits. The experimental results demonstrate that using low enlargement and resolution microdrill bit images the proposed method can measure up to high inspection accuracy, and provide a conclusion that the highest identification rates are obtained by PCA-SVMs, which are higher than that of the conventional method.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2216260","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392452","Automatic visual inspection;microdrill bit;phase identification;statistical shape model;support vector machines (SVMs)","Integrated circuit layout;Principal component analysis;Printed circuits;Visualization","geometry;image resolution;inspection;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern recognition;principal component analysis;printed circuit manufacture;support vector machines","PCA;PCB production;SVM;automatic visual inspection;geometric quantities;image enlargement;image resolution;k-nearest neighbors;linear discriminate analysis;machine learning-based framework;microdrill bits;neural networks;pattern recognition;phase identification;principal component analysis;printed circuit board;statistical shape models;support vector machines","","2","","29","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It uses locally weighted learning to tailor a classifier model to each patient and computes the sequence of biomarkers most informative or cost-effective to diagnose patients. Using ADNI data, we classified AD versus controls and MCI patients who progressed to AD within a year, against those who did not. The approach performed similarly to considering all data at once, while significantly reducing the number (and cost) of the biomarkers needed to achieve a confident diagnosis for each patient.

The learning speed of the algorithm is very slow, especially for large database, due to iteratively tuning the weight parameters of the networks with back propagation algorithm. In order to deal with this problem, based on extreme learning machine (ELM), we propose a feature selection algorithm which uses a feature ranking criterion to measure the significance of a feature by computing the aggregate difference of the outputs of the probabilistic SLFN with and without the feature. The SLFN is trained with ELM which randomly chooses the weights of hidden layer and analytically determines the weights of output layer.

We evaluate the machine learning methodology used in 21 fault prediction studies. All of these studies use NASA data sets. We score each study from 1 to 10 in terms of the quality of their machine learning methodology (e.g. whether or not studies report randomising their cross validation folds). Only 10 out of the 21 studies scored 5 or more out of 10. Furthermore 1 study scored only 1 out of 10. When we plot these scores over time there is no evidence that the quality of machine learning methodology is better in recent studies. Our results suggest that there remains much to be done by both researchers and reviewers to improve the quality of machine learning methodology used in software fault prediction.

In order to exploit this feature, one has to expose data locality with-in a program. Loop tiling is an optimization phase in modern compilers which is used to transform a loop for exposing data locality. Selecting the best tile size for a given architecture and compiler is known as Optimal Tile Size Selection Problem. It is a NP-hard problem. People have build cost models for this problem that characterize the performance of a program as a function of tile sizes. The best tile size for a given loop is determined directly by using these models. Hand crafting an accurate tile size selection cost model is hard. Can we automatically learn a tile size selection model? This is an important question. In this paper, we have shown that a fairly accurate model can be learned using simple program dynamic features with standard machine learning techniques. We evaluate our approach on different architecture and compiler combinations. The model given by us consistently shows near-optimal performance (within 4% of the optimal) across all architecture and compiler combinations.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406709","artificial neural networks;compiler optimization;loop tiling; loop blocking;machine learning;tile size selection","Artificial neural networks;Computer architecture;Kernel;Machine learning;Predictive models;Tiles","learning (artificial intelligence);memory architecture;optimisation;program compilers","NP-hard problem;compiler combinations;data locality;deep memory hierarchies;loop tiling;near-optimal performance;optimal tile size selection problem;optimization phase;program dynamic features;program performance;standard machine learning techniques","","0","","19","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our pipeline consists of three stages - (1) a segmentation layer where brain MRI data is divided into clinically relevant regions, (2) a classification layer that uses relational learning algorithms to make pair wise predictions between the three classes, and (3) a combination layer that combines the results of the different classes to obtain the final classification. One of the key features of our proposed approach is that it allows for domain expert's knowledge to guide the learning in all the layers.

In addition, there are no effective methods for predicting learning effectiveness in order to enable early intervention in the classroom. Most of the current approaches to assess achievement of SE teamwork skills rely solely on qualitative and subjective data taken as surveys at the end of the class and analyzed only with very rudimentary data analysis. In this paper we present a novel approach to address the assessment and prediction of student learning of teamwork effectiveness in software engineering education based on: a) extracting only objective and quantitative student team activity data during their team class project; b) pairing these data with related independent observations and grading of student team effectiveness in SE process and SE product components in order to create “training database” and c) applying a machine learning (ML) approach, namely random forest classification (RF), to the above training database in order to create ML models, ranked factors and rules that can both explain (e.g. assess) as well as provide prediction of the student teamwork effectiveness.

We monitored leaf-changing patterns of a cerrado-savanna vegetation by taken daily digital images. We extract RGB channels from digital images and correlated with phenological changes. Our first goals were: (1) to test if the color change information is able to characterize the phenological pattern of a group of species; and (2) to test if individuals from the same functional group may be automatically identified using digital images. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to detect phenological patterns in the digital images. Our preliminary results indicate that: (1) extreme hours (morning and afternoon) are the best for identifying plant species; and (2) different plant species present a different behavior with respect to the color change information.

KPR offers a strong smoothing capability critical to the robustness of regression or classification results. For Gaussian cases, the notion of orthogonal polynomials is instrumental to optimal estimation and its error analysis. More exactly, the regressor may be expressed as a linear combination of many simple Hermite Regressors, each focusing on one (and only one) orthogonal polynomial. For Gaussian or non-Gaussian cases, this paper formally establishes a “Two-Projection Theorem” allowing the estimation task to be divided into two projection stages: the first projection reveals the effect of model-induced error (caused by under-represented regressor models) while the second projection reveals the extra estimation error due to the (inevitable) input measuring error. The two-projection analysis leads to a closed-form error formula critical for order/error tradeoff. The simulation results not only confirm the theoretical prediction but also demonstrate superiority of KPR over the conventional ridge regression method in MSE reduction.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-1026-0; POD:978-1-4673-1024-6; USB:978-1-4673-1025-3","10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349743","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6349743","","Estimation;Kernel;Polynomials;Regression analysis;Robustness;Smoothing methods;Vectors","Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;polynomials;regression analysis","Gaussian cases;Hermite regressors;KPR regressor;MSE reduction;classification results;closed-form error formula;conventional ridge regression method;error analysis;errors-in-variables models;extra estimation error;input measuring error;model-induced error effect;order-error tradeoff;orthogonal polynomials;perturbation regulated kernel regressors;regression robustness;supervised machine learning;two-projection analysis;two-projection theorem;underrepresented regressor models","","0","","8","","","23-26 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The best result shows successful rate of 60.6% in 3-channel cases of ECoG database and successful rate of 70% in 3-channel cases of EEG database.","1094-687X;1094687X","Electronic:978-1-4577-1787-1; POD:978-1-4244-4119-8; USB:978-1-4244-4120-4","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6347156","","Databases;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","electroencephalography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal classification","3-channel selection;ECoG;EEG;epilepsy seizure prediction;high dimensional bivariate synchronization;implantable devices;machine learning;pattern recognition;wearable devices","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain Mapping;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","0","","11","","","Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paradigm enables many systems to interact with each other and share their knowledge while keeping their own ontology. Several researchers have worked on this topic with different strategies but they all argue that the main issue is to make sure that the other systems understand the concepts of its domain correctly. In order to be sure that they understand each other, systems use concept learning to learn the meaning of concepts they communicate with. In this paper, we try to overcome this complexity by suggesting a system that enables agents to learn new concepts from several different agents at the same time and each agent has its own ontology. We use social networks paradigm to communicate between agents to enhance the accuracy of learning process.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6407376","machine learning; distributed knowledge management; concept learning; multi-agent system; social network; ontology","Accuracy;Computer languages;Educational institutions;Ontologies;Semantics;Social network services","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","Internet;agent communication;distributed knowledge;knowledge sharing;machine learning;multi-agent system;ontology","","0","","24","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is clarified in a sample implementation that combines three separate datasets (patient data, drug-drug interactions and drug prescription rules) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in producing effective medical decisions. In short, we demonstrate the potential for machine learning to support a task where there is a critical need from medical professionals by coping with missing or noisy patient data and enabling the use of multiple medical datasets.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406705","feature extraction and classification;knowledge representation and reasoning;machine learning in medicine","Accuracy;Decision making;Drugs;Knowledge based systems;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Semantics","decision making;decision support systems;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems","drug prescription rules;drug-drug interactions;health information systems;interoperability;machine learning techniques;medical decision making;medical decision support system;medical professionals;missing patient data;ontology-based automated reasoning;patient datasets","","0","","13","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Faults are due to internal and external influences, such as calibration, low battery, environmental interference and sensor aging. However, only few solutions exist to deal with faulty sensory data in WSN. We develop a statistical approach to detect and identify faults in a WSN. In particular, we focus on the identification and classification of data and system fault types as it is essential to perform accurate recovery actions. Our method uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to capture the fault-free dynamics of an environment and dynamics of faulty data. It then performs a structural analysis of these HMMs to determine the type of data and system faults affecting sensor measurements. The approach is validated using real data obtained from over one month of samples from motes deployed in an actual living lab.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4914-9; POD:978-1-4673-5165-2","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6417349","","Batteries;Calibration;Data models;Fault diagnosis;Hidden Markov models;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","HMM;WSN;battery;calibration;data classification;data identification;environmental interference;fault classification;fault identification;fault-free dynamics;hidden Markov model;machine learning approach;sensor aging;sensor measurement;statistical approach;structural analysis;wireless sensor network deployment","","5","","9","","","5-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We leverage the memristor nanodevice to build an N×N crossbar array to store synaptic weights with significantly reduced area cost. Our design integrates N digital leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and the respective on-line learning circuits for a spike timing-dependent learning rule. The proposed analog-to-digital conversion scheme accumulates pre-synaptic weights of a neuron efficiently and reduces silicon area by using only one shared adder for processing LIF operations of N neurons. The proposed architecture is shown to be both area and power efficient. With 256 neurons and 64K synapses, the power dissipation and the area of our design are evaluated as 9.46-mW and 0.66-mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, in a 90-nm CMOS technology.","2164-1676;21641676","Electronic:978-1-4673-1295-0; POD:978-1-4673-1294-3","10.1109/SOCC.2012.6398336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6398336","","Arrays;Electric potential;Hardware;Memristors;Neuromorphics;Neurons","CMOS digital integrated circuits;VLSI;analogue-digital conversion;learning (artificial intelligence);memristors;neural nets","CMOS technology;analog-to-digital conversion scheme;digital LIF neurons;digital leaky integrate-and-fire neurons;large-scale spiking neural networks;machine learning;memristor crossbar synaptic array;memristor nanodevice;online learning circuits;power 9.46 mW;power dissipation;pre-synaptic weights;reconfigurable digital neuromorphic VLSI architecture;silicon area;size 90 nm;spike timing-dependent learning rule;synaptic weights","","19","","13","","","12-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is further characterized as inappropriate developmentally symptoms of inattention, impulsiveness, motor over-activity and restlessness. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of diagnosing ADHD by analyzing the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In addition to confirming the previously observed three areas including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulated cortex (PCC) and ventro medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), we also found significant differences in cerebellum, motor cortex and temporal lobe between ADHD and normal humans based on regional homogeneity analysis of the dataset from 73 children with ADHD and 76 normal children. Extracting features from these seven brain areas and utilizing the LDA classifier, the average accuracy of distinguishing normal and ADHD children reaches 80.08% though 50 times of 2-fold validation. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of ADHD diagnosis based on the combination of functional connectivity of resting-state fMRI and machine learning technique.","2377-5823;23775823","Electronic:978-1-4673-2056-6; POD:978-1-4673-2057-3","10.1109/iFUZZY.2012.6409719","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6409719","ADHD;function connectivity;regional homogeneity;resting-state fMRI","Accuracy;Correlation;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Humans;Magnetic resonance imaging;Time series analysis","biomedical MRI;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","ACC;ADHD diagnosis;ADHD subject;LDA classifier;PCC;anterior cingulate cortex;attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder;cerebellum;functional connectivity;functional magnetic resonance imaging;impulsiveness symptom;inattention symptom;linear discriminate analysis;machine learning technique;motor cortex;motor over-activity symptom;neuropsychiatric disorder;posterior cingulated cortex;resting-state fMRI data;restlessness symptom;ventro medial prefrontal cortex;vmPFC","","0","","22","","","16-18 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the cases where according to the value of an attribute or the values of two attributes the corresponding classification result can be determined, we use the Rough set classifier.
