A set of cluster features was discovered using global CM algorithm to characterize AFF activities on internet. These features were used to train SVM and RF to classify an e-mail document as either containing AFF related information or not.

In Web proxy caching, the popular Web objects that are likely to be revisited in the near future are stored on the proxy server, which plays the key roles between users and Web sites in reducing the response time of user requests and saving the network bandwidth. However, the difficulty in determining which Web objects will be re-visited in the future is still a problem faced by existing Web proxy caching techniques. In this paper, machine learning techniques are implemented to cope with the above problem. We present new intelligent approaches, which depend on the capability of Support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (C4.5) to learn from Web proxy logs file and predict the classes of objects to be re-visited or not.

Proteins structures are inherently complicated objects with a mixture of crisp and fuzzy properties. Therefore developing effective representations for them is a research problem in itself, while quantifying and predicting properties and structure is of immediate importance in structural biology. This paper focuses on developing a compact, effective, efficient and accurate representation of protein structure that is compatible with widely used machine learning tools like the SVM. Graphs based on Delaunay triangulation are used to represent the structure, and then functions are constructed from these graphs to develop constant-size representations of protein structure that are tightly bound to the amino acid sequence. The representations preserve sufficient information to be valuable for model vs. experimental structure classification and regression analysis of model quality.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1613-3; POD:978-1-4577-1612-6","10.1109/BIBMW.2011.6112396","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112396","","Accuracy;Amino acids;Benchmark testing;Encoding;Machine learning;Protein engineering;Proteins","bioinformatics;biological techniques;data mining;mesh generation;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;proteins;regression analysis;support vector machines","Delaunay triangulation based graphs;SVM;data mining;effective protein structure representations;machine learning;model quality;protein structure analysis;protein structure encoding;protein structure prediction;regression analysis;structural biology;structure classification;support vector machine","","3","","15","","","12-15 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of that, there have been significant investments from private and government organizations for developing methods for removing replicas from its data repositories. This is due to the fact that clean and replica-free repositories not only allow the retrieval of higher quality information but also lead to more concise data and to potential savings in computational time and resources to process this data. In this paper, we propose a genetic programming approach to record deduplication that combines several different pieces of evidence extracted from the data content to find a deduplication function that is able to identify whether two entries in a repository are replicas or not. As shown by our experiments, our approach outperforms an existing state-of-the-art method found in the literature. Moreover, the suggested functions are computationally less demanding since they use fewer evidence. In addition, our genetic programming approach is capable of automatically adapting these functions to a given fixed replica identification boundary, freeing the user from the burden of having to choose and tune this parameter.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645623","Database administration;database integration.;evolutionary computing and genetic algorithms","Data mining;Databases;Genetic programming;Machine learning;Probabilistic logic;Training","genetic algorithms;information retrieval;replicated databases","computational time;data repositories;database administration;database integration;digital libraries;e-commerce brokers;fixed replica identification boundary;genetic programming;information retrieval;record deduplication;replica removal;replica-free repositories","","20","","33","","20101129","March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, existing techniques restrict these properties to categorical labels (for example, a person is `smiling' or not, a scene is `dry' or not), and thus fail to capture more general semantic relationships. We propose to model relative attributes. Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We then build a generative model over the joint space of attribute ranking outputs, and propose a novel form of zero-shot learning in which the supervisor relates the unseen object category to previously seen objects via attributes (for example, `bears are furrier than giraffes'). We further show how the proposed relative attributes enable richer textual descriptions for new images, which in practice are more precise for human interpretation. We demonstrate the approach on datasets of faces and natural scenes, and show its clear advantages over traditional binary attribute prediction for these new tasks.","1550-5499;15505499","Electronic:978-1-4577-1102-2; POD:978-1-4577-1101-5","10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126281","","Humans;Image recognition;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training;Visualization;Vocabulary","face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);natural scenes","binary attribute prediction;categorical label;face dataset;human interpretation;human-name visual attribute;image textual description;learned ranking function;natural scene;object category;ranking function per attribute;recognition task;scene category;training data;zero-shot learning","","237","5","33","","","6-13 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While machine learning methods classify opinions by statistical properties such as term frequency, lexicon-based methods could reflect the intricate semantics in determining the opinion orientation and strength. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised opinion phrase extraction and rating mechanism with opinion lexicons. First, opinion phrases are extracted from each blog post by matching terms in the opinion lexicon. Then, scores are assigned to each opinion phrase for different scales of opinion strength. Finally, the total score for the post is estimated by averaging all of its opinion phrases. From the experimental results on digital camera posts, the proposed method achieved high accuracy with sigmoid scoring. This shows effective extraction of opinion phrases and rating of opinion scales.

As a result, new interdisciplinary research directions have emerged in which social network analysis methods are applied to networks containing hundreds millions of users. Unfortunately, links between individuals may be missing due to imperfect acquirement processes or because they are not yet reflected in the online network (i.e., friends in real world did not form a virtual connection.) Existing link prediction techniques lack the scalability required for full application on a continuously growing social network which may be adding everyday users with thousands of connections. The primary bottleneck in link prediction techniques is extracting structural features required for classifying links. In this paper we propose a set of simple, easy-to-compute structural features that can be analyzed to identify missing links. We show that a machine learning classifier trained using the proposed simple structural features can successfully identify missing links even when applied to a hard problem of classifying links between individuals who have at least one common friend. A new friends measure that we developed is shown to be a good predictor for missing links and an evaluation experiment was performed on five large social networks datasets: Face book, Flickr, You Tube, Academia and The Marker. Our methods can provide social network site operators with the capability of helping users to find known, offline contacts and to discover new friends online. They may also be used for exposing hidden links in an online social network.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4578-3; POD:978-1-4577-1931-8","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113097","HiddenLinks;Link Prediction;Social Networks;Supervised Learning","Crawlers;Facebook;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Training;YouTube","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online)","Academia;Facebook;Flickr;The Marker;You Tube;friends measure;link classification;link prediction technique;machine learning classifier;missing link identification;network topological feature;social network analysis","","25","","28","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the advance of high-throughput genomics technologies, it becomes critical to mine alternative splicing knowledge from biological research literature. Meanwhile, there have been many papers published on DNA splicing and translation and it is time-consuming to find papers specifically relevant to alternative splicing. Observing that documents reporting alternative splicing can be obtained from existing knowledge bases recording literature evidences and also that a large number of unlabeled documents are freely available, we investigated learning from positive and unlabeled data (LPU) for retrieving papers relevant to alternative splicing. The positive documents are from Literature Support for Alternative Transcripts (LSAT) and unlabeled documents are obtained from Gene Reference Into Function (GeneRIF). We generated nine unlabeled datasets different in size or the way documents were sampled, and compared the performance of document classifiers built using different unlabeled datasets and machine learning algorithms. The study shows that LPU is a viable strategy to build document filtering system, while the performance of trained classifiers is affected by the choice of the unlabeled data set. Selection of machine learning algorithms and that of unlabeled documents would be critical in constructing an effective LPU-based system.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1613-3; POD:978-1-4577-1612-6","10.1109/BIBMW.2011.6112425","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112425","Alternative Splicing;Document Retrieval;LPU","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms;Reliability;Splicing;Support vector machines;Training","document handling;genomics;medical computing","Gene Reference Into Function;LPU-based system;alternative splicing sentence;automated detection;biological research literature;document classifiers;document filtering system;eukaryotes;functional complexity;high-throughput genomics technology;machine learning algorithm;medline abstracts;unlabeled data set;unlabeled datasets;unlabeled documents","","0","","18","","","12-15 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By grouping distributed renewable energy generations and loads, a microgrid, which is seen as one of the cornerstones of the future smart grids, can disconnect from the macrogrid and function autonomously. This intentional islanding of generations and loads has the potential to provide a higher local reliability than that provided by the power system as a whole. One of the fundamental issues for a user in an islanded microgrid is how to find the one among the distributed renewable energy resources (DRERs) in a microgrid, which can supply the power most efficiently, effectively and reliably, as its power supply source. This problem is difficult since the power pattern of renewable resources, such as wind and solar, is variable and generally speaking is not easy to accurately predict. In order to solve this problem, we first propose a distributed DRER discovery approach to discover all the available DRERs within a microgrid. Furthermore, based on the online machine learning theory, we propose two distributed algorithms according to the information the user can obtain, in order to compute a good DRER access strategy, with no assumption on what distribution the power patterns of the DRERs follow. We prove that when the time horizon is sufficiently large, on average the upper bound on the gap between the expected profit obtained at each time slot by using the global optimal strategy and that by using our algorithms is arbitrarily small.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4244-9268-8; POD:978-1-4244-9266-4","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134311","","Electricity;Machine learning algorithms;Power supplies;Reliability;Renewable energy resources;Smart grids","distributed power generation;learning (artificial intelligence);power distribution reliability;renewable energy sources;smart power grids","distributed automated energy delivery network;global optimal strategy;islanded microgrids;local reliability;next generation power grid;online machine learning theory;online strategizing distributed renewable energy resource access;resource discovery;smart grid;time slot","","7","","17","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, it is important and necessary to classify these topics into general categories with high accuracy for better information retrieval. To address this problem, we classify Twitter Trending Topics into 18 general categories such as sports, politics, technology, etc. We experiment with 2 approaches for topic classification, (i) the well-known Bag-of-Words approach for text classification and (ii) network-based classification. In text-based classification method, we construct word vectors with trending topic definition and tweets, and the commonly used tf-idf weights are used to classify the topics using a Naive Bayes Multinomial classifier. In network-based classification method, we identify top 5 similar topics for a given topic based on the number of common influential users. The categories of the similar topics and the number of common influential users between the given topic and its similar topics are used to classify the given topic using a C5.0 decision tree learner. Experiments on a database of randomly selected 768 trending topics (over 18 classes) show that classification accuracy of up to 65% and 70% can be achieved using text-based and network-based classification modeling respectively.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-0-7695-4409-0; POD:978-1-4673-0005-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2011.171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137387","Social Networks;Topic Classification;Twitter","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Data models;Labeling;Machine learning;Twitter","Bayes methods;decision trees;information retrieval;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis","C5.0 decision tree learner;Twitter trending topic classification;bag-of-words approach;information explosion;information retrieval;microblogging sites;naive Bayes multinomial classifier;network-based classification;politics;sports;technology;text-based classification method;tf-idf weights;word vectors","","38","","18","","","11-11 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In current web sites and data bases of sequences there are, usually, a set of paper references linked to each sequence. Those links are very useful because the papers describe useful information concerning the sequences. They are, therefore, a good starting point to look for relevant information related to a set of sequences. One way is to implement such approach is to do a blast with the new decoded sequences, and collect similar sequences. Then one looks at the papers linked with the similar sequences. Most often the number of retrieved papers is small and one has to search large data bases for relevant papers. In this paper we propose a process of generating a classifier based on the initially set of relevant papers that are directly linked to the similar sequences retrieved and use that classifier to automatically enlarge the set of relevant papers by searching the MEDLINE using the automatically constructed classifier.

Furthermore, it is difficult for end users to accurately specify performance goals to the storage system using I/O-related metrics such as request latency or throughput. As access patterns, request rates, and the system workload change in time, a fixed I/O performance goal, such as bounds on throughput or latency, can be expensive to achieve and may not provide performance guarantees such as bounded program execution time. We propose a scheme supporting end-users' QoS goals, specified in terms of program execution time, in shared storage environments. We automatically translate the users' performance goals into instantaneous I/O throughput bounds using a machine learning technique, and use dynamically determined service time windows to efficiently meet the throughput bounds. We have implemented this scheme in the PVFS2 parallel file system and have conducted an extensive evaluation. Our results show that this scheme can satisfy realistic end-user QoS requirements by making highly efficient use of the I/O resources. The scheme seeks to balance programs' attainment of QoS requirements, and saves as much of the remaining I/O capacity as possible for best-effort programs.","2167-4329;21674329","Electronic:978-1-4503-0771-0; POD:978-1-4503-0771-0; USB:978-1-4503-0771-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6114425","PVFS2;QoS;Shared Storage System","Machine learning;Predictive models;Quality of service;Servers;Throughput;Training;Vectors","input-output programs;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service;shared memory systems;storage management","IO resources;IO services;IO-intensive applications;IO-related metrics;PVFS2 parallel file system;QoS support;QoS-aware process scheduling;best-effort programs;bounded program execution time;compute-bound applications;dynamically determined service time windows;end-user QoS goals;extensive evaluation;fixed IO performance goal;individual quality requirements;instantaneous IO throughput bounds;machine learning technique;realistic end-user QoS requirements;shared storage environments;shared storage systems;space sharing;system workload change","","2","","37","","","12-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in order to build robust detectors, the learning process suffers from the scalability issues including the high-dimensional multi-modality visual features and the large-scale keyframe examples. In this paper, we propose parallel lasso (Plasso) by introducing the parallel distributed computation to significantly improve the scalability of lasso (the <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> regularized least squares). We apply the parallel incomplete Cholesky factorization to approximate the covariance statistics in the preprocess step, and the parallel primal-dual interior-point method with the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula to optimize the model parameters. For a dataset with <i>n</i> samples in a <i>d</i>-dimensional space, compared with lasso, Plasso significantly reduces complexities from the original <i>O</i>(<i>d</i><sup>3</sup>) for computational time and <i>O</i>(<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>) for storage space to <i>O</i>(<i>h</i><sup>2</sup><i>d</i>/<i>m</i>) and <i>O</i>(<i>hd</i>/<i>m</i>) , respectively, if the system has <i>m</i> processors and the reduced dimension <i>h</i> is much smaller than the original dimension <i>d</i> . Furthermore, we develop the kernel extension of the proposed linear algorithm with the sample reweighting schema, and we can achieve similar time and space complexity improvements [time complexity from <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>) to <i>O</i>(<i>h</i><sup>2</sup><i>n</i>/<i>m</i>) and the space complexity from <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) to <i>O</i>(<i>hn</i>/<i>m</i>), for a dataset with <i>n</i> training examples].

Our approach constructs a graph structure based on the side information so that both connectivity relation and side information can be uniformly dealt with in terms of graph representation.

It has become a standard paradigm for batch oriented workloads. As the adoption of this paradigm has increased rapidly, scheduling of these MapReduce jobs has become a problem of great interest in research community. We propose an approach which tries to maintain harmony among the jobs running on the cluster, and in turn decrease their runtime. In our model, the scheduler is made aware of different types of jobs running on the cluster. The scheduler tries to allocate a task on a node if the incoming task does not affect the tasks already running on that node. From the list of available pending tasks, our algorithm selects the one that is most compatible with the tasks already running on that node. We bring up heuristic and machine learning based solutions to our approach and try to maintain a resource balance on the cluster by not overloading any of the nodes, thereby reducing the overall runtime of the jobs. The results show a saving of runtime of around 21% in the case of heuristic based approach and around 27% in the case of machine learning based approach when compared to Yahoo's Capacity scheduler.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4622-3; POD:978-1-4673-0090-2","10.1109/CloudCom.2011.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133221","Cloud Computing;Job Scheduling;MachineLearning;MapReduce","Availability;Clustering algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Runtime;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);scheduling","MapReduce framework;Yahoo capacity scheduler;batch oriented workloads;job aware scheduling algorithm;large scale computing;machine learning based solutions","","12","1","15","","","Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Comparing two exemplars requires a distance calculation between their features, a task which becomes more difficult when some of these features are missing. A possible solution is to predict the missing features making use of those that are known. Prediction of features is considered a hard task in machine learning and becomes more difficult when features have a complex structure and the relationship between the features is not clearly defined. This paper presents a framework for predicting complex features based on exemplar theory. The framework presented consists of two stages. The first stage is the similarity correlation stage, in which the correlation between the distance matrices of the features is calculated to determine the relationship between missing and existing features. The second stage calculates the conditional membership probability between these features using the distance matrices; this value determines the probability that for a new example not found in the dataset for which only some features are known, an exemplar with similar features to those of missing features that can be adapted to serve as appropriate features for the new example.

In particular, the experiments based on different priorities of performing feature selection and data reduction are conducted. The results show that performing data reduction only can allow the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to provide the highest rate of prediction accuracy.

Acupuncture is a traditional treatment of Chinese medicine for neck pain, whose therapeutic mechanism follows the classic knowledge and understanding of Chinese medicine. Syndrome-based diagnosis and treatment is a significant feature of Chinese medicine, and guides the practice of acupuncture. In the treatment of neck pain, acupuncture provides a standard prescription whose effect is support by latest multi-center RCTs. However, the potential difference of its effectiveness in different syndrome types is challenged due to small sample size and limits of statistical power. In our study, we apply the machine learning methods to a data set of the outcomes of a multi-center RCT clinical trial, which consists of demographical information and efficacy outcomes. A decision tree with kernel mapping was applied as the main algorithm to discover the underlying relationship and difference between clinical outcomes among different syndrome types, and to predict its tendency in trials with larger sample size. Kernel function is used to map the input data items to a feature space with better representation, which yields a smooth KNN classification boundary. Non-Dominated Sort (NDS) is used to obtain an optimal order of the three efficacy outcomes from a small sample at the beginning. Then the proposed method was tested with the clinical data from a large sample from a multi-center RCT conducted from 2006 to 2010. The result shows the proposed algorithm is capable of discovering the underlying difference among different syndrome types and feasible to predict the effective tendency in clinical trials of large sample. Therefore, it provides a potential solution for interim analysis of clinical trials, which overcomes the limitation of conventional statistical methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1613-3; POD:978-1-4577-1612-6","10.1109/BIBMW.2011.6112467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112467","acupuncture;decision tree;interim analysis;kernel mapping;non-dominated sort","Accuracy;Kernel;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Medical treatment;Neck;Pain","learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical disorders;patient treatment","demographical information;interim analysis;kernel mapping;kernel-decision tree based algorithm;machine learning method;multicenter RCT clinical trial;neck pain;non-dominated sort;patient treatment;smooth KNN classification boundary","","1","","16","","","12-15 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the existing protein subcellular localization methods are only used to deal with the single-location proteins. To better reflect the characteristics of multiplex proteins, we formulate prediction of subcellular localization of multiplex proteins as a multi-label learning problem. We present and compare two multi-label learning approaches, which exploit correlations between labels and leverage label-specific features, respectively, to induce a high quality prediction model. Experimental results on six protein data sets under various organisms show that our described methods achieve significantly higher performance than any of the existing methods.

In many applications the concept label of query sample can be evaluated effectively only by similar training samples, such as the famous K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier. The metric of locality or similarity is essential in local learning, which is often application oriented and implied in local geometry of input space. In this paper, we propose to apply local learning to the task of outcome assessment and evaluation on acupuncture for cervical spondylosis (CS) in a multi-center clinical trial. The analytic data are measures of three questionnaires which are recognized tools for subjective patient-reported outcomes (PROs) evaluation. We propose a similarity evaluation method based on both Euclidean distance and the therapy effect of recent records.

It concerns the increment of the certainty degree to measure the importance of the breakpoints for a decision table. Afterwards, by simultaneously increasing the certainty degree and decreasing the uncertainty level for a decision table, another new aggregated algorithm measures the importance of breakpoints in a comprehensive and reasonable way.

It considers various types of costs, such as test costs and misclassification costs. The test-cost-sensitive attribute reduction problem attracts our interest. It aims at finding a minimal cost test set, which preserves whole information of the decision system. An existing heuristic algorithm is proposed to address the problem. However, the results are unsatisfactory in larger datasets. Since genetic algorithms provide robust search in complex spaces and work well on combinatorial problems. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the genetic algorithm to produce better results. In the algorithm, the fitness function is constructed based on the number of selected conditional attributes, the positive region, test costs and a user-specified non-positive exponent λ. A number of reducts are produced with different λ settings. Then the best reduct is selected as the suboptimal reduct. We compare the performance of the new approach with the existing one through experiments in four UCI (University of California-Irvine) datasets. Results show that the new approach generally produces better results and is more appropriate for medium-sized datasets than the existing one. The new algorithm can be further combined with the existing one to produce even better results.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0371-3; POD:978-1-4577-0372-0","10.1109/GRC.2011.6122654","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122654","Cost-sensitive learning;attribute reduction;genetic algorithm;test cost","Biological cells;Data mining;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Maintenance engineering;Measurement;Rough sets","combinatorial mathematics;cost reduction;data mining;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","UCI datasets;combinatorial problem;complex space;conditional attribute;cost sensitive attribute reduction problem;cost sensitive learning;data mining;decision system;fitness function;genetic algorithm;heuristic algorithm;machine learning application;medium-sized datasets;minimal test cost reduction problem;misclassification cost;robust search;suboptimal reduct;user specified nonpositive exponent","","5","","27","","","8-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed ensemble first exploits a sparse non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) process to represent data instances in parts and partition the data space into localities, and then coordinates the individual classifiers in each locality for final classification. In the sparse NMF, data exemplars are projected to a set of locality bases, in which the non-negative superposition of basis images reconstructs the original exemplars. This additive combination ensures that each locality captures the characteristics of data exemplars in part, thus enabling the local classifiers to hold reasonable diversity in their own regions of expertise. More importantly, the sparse NMF ensures that an exemplar is projected to only a few bases (localities) with non-zero coefficients. The resultant ensemble model is, therefore, sparse, in the way that only a small number of efficient classifiers in the ensemble will fire on a testing sample. Extensive tests on the TRECVid 08 and 09 datasets show that the proposed ensemble learning achieves promising results and outperforms existing approaches. The proposed scheme is feature-independent, and can be applied in many other large scale pattern recognition problems besides visual concept detection.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2011.2168198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6020805","Concept detection;ensemble learning;non-negative matrix factorization;pattern recognition;sparse coding","Cameras;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Machine learning;Semantics;Videos;Visualization","image classification;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;object detection;video signal processing","concept detection;data exemplars;images reconstruction;individual classifiers;local classifiers;pattern recognition problems;sparse ensemble learning scheme;sparse nonnegative matrix factorization process;videos","","19","","79","","20110915","Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, a method is proposed to adapt the distance measure by weighting instances in order to improve the performance of Local-SVM classifier. A positive weight is assigned to each instance and instances that have no influence on the performance of SVM get the weight 0, and therefore will be removed in the training phase.

In general, however, it is difficult to achieve both 2) and 3) under the condition 1). In addition to typical reduction of attributes, we consider reduction of attribute domains, the number of possible attribute values in each attribute, aiming at obtaining simpler but more readable rules.

However, there are very few works on classification of words into classes or concepts (e.g. thesaurus). In this paper, we consider this topic, especially in the context of the classification of names like brand names or neologisms. The challenge is thus to provide automated tools to analyze new names by classifying them into concepts. Then, for example, a naming company customer can be informed about which concept a new name is closest to. As we argue that a word can belong to several concepts, we propose to consider the top-k classification approach. Moreover, we rely on syllables to build the classification model. The word corpus is collected from French thesaurus. All labeled-words are separated into syllables. Feature selection techniques are used to select discriminative syllables. We use a syllables frequency (SF) and mutual information (MI) performing with Naive Bayes classifier and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Instead of selecting only one class, the model select top-k classes ranking them by a classifier score. The result shows the top-k classification model helps to analyze a new word by showing that it can be related to more than one concept. Moreover, the set of discriminative syllables can be used to explain the classification results which makes the results more meaningful.","1529-4188;15294188","Electronic:978-0-7695-4486-1; POD:978-1-4577-0982-1","10.1109/DEXA.2011.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059819","Discriminative Features;Feature Selection;Syllables;Text Classification;Words Classification","Accuracy;Machine learning;Mutual information;Pain;Testing;Thesauri;Training","Bayes methods;pattern classification;text analysis;word processing","French thesaurus;K-nearest neighbor;automated tools;classifier score;computer scientists;discriminative syllables;feature selection;labeled words;linguists;naive Bayes classifier;naming company customer;neologism;syllables frequency;syllables-based model;text classification;top-k classes;top-k classification model;word corpus;words classification","","0","","12","","","Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is believed that a large number of genes undergoes alternative splicing. Predicting alternative splicing events is a problem of great interest, as it can help the understanding of transcript diversity. Supervised machine learning approaches can be used to predict alternative splicing events at genome level. However, supervised approaches require large amounts of labeled data to learn accurate classifiers. While large amounts of genomic data are produced by the new sequencing technologies, labeling these data can be costly and time consuming. Therefore, semi- supervised learning approaches that can make use of large amounts of unlabeled data, in addition to small amounts of labeled data are highly desirable. In this work, we study the usefulness of a semi-supervised learning approach, co-training, for classifying exons as alternatively spliced or constitutive. The co-training algorithm makes use of two views of the data to iteratively learn two classifiers that can inform each other, at each step, with their best predictions on the unlabeled data. We consider two sets of features for constructing views for the problem of predicting alternatively spliced exons: exonic splicing enhancers and intronic regulatory sequences. We use the Naive Bayes Multinomial algorithm as a base classifier in our study.

However, optimal proactive resource provisioning and scaling for a specific Web application require, at the least, a profile of the application's current workload and a model of the application's capacity under various resource configurations. Here we focus on multi-tier Web applications. The capacity of a multi-tier Web application varies substantially as the pattern of requests in the workload changes. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a black-box method for capacity prediction that first identifies workload patterns for a multi-tier Web application from access logs using unsupervised machine learning and then, based on those patterns, builds a model capable of predicting the application's capacity for any specific workload pattern. In an experimental evaluation, we compare a baseline method that predicts capacity without a model of the application-specific workload patterns to several regression models using the proposed workload identification method. All of the models based on workload pattern identification outperform the baseline method. The best model, a Gaussian process regression model, gives only 6.42% error. Cloud providers utilizing our method can proactively perform dynamic allocation of resources to multi-tier Web applications, meeting service level agreements at minimal cost.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1637-9; POD:978-1-4577-1635-5","10.1109/CSC.2011.6138506","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6138506","","Benchmark testing;Machine learning;Monitoring;Predictive models;Resource management;Time factors;Training","Gaussian processes;cloud computing;regression analysis;resource allocation;unsupervised learning;virtualisation","Gaussian process regression model;black-box approach;black-box method;capacity identification;cloud-based Web application hosting environment;dynamic resource allocation;dynamic resource provisioning;multitier Web application;optimal proactive resource provisioning;resource utilization minimisation;service level agreements;unsupervised machine learning;virtualization;virtualized platform;workload pattern identification","","6","","17","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the analysis on the several limitations of traditional LDA, this paper makes an effort to propose a new way named Hierarchical Harmony Linear Discriminant Analysis (HH-LDA), which computes between class scatter matrixes optimally. It is reached by combining hierarchical scheme and Harmony Search (HS) algorithm. In this paper, a pre-processing step is proposed in order to increase accuracy of classification. The aim of this approach is finding a transformation matrix causes classes to be more discriminable by transforming data into the new space and consequently, increases the classification accuracy. This transformation matrix is computed through two methods based on linear discrimination. In the first method, we use class dependent LDA to increase classification accuracy by finding a transformation that maximizes the between-class scatter and minimizes within-class scatter using a transformation matrix. Because LDA cannot obtain optimal transformation, in the second method, Harmony Search is used to increase performance of LDA. Obtained results show that utilization of these pre-processing causes increasing the accuracy of different classifiers.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1131-1; POD:978-1-4673-0091-9","10.1109/ICI.2011.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141652","Harmony Search;Linear Discriminant Analysis;classification;pre-processing","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Glass;Indexes;Machine learning;Optimization;Vectors","pattern classification;search problems","between-class scatter;class scatter matrix;classification;feature reduction;harmony search algorithm;hierarchical harmony linear discriminant analysis;hierarchical scheme;transformation matrix;within-class scatter","","0","","21","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although metric learning methods have been studied for many years, metric learners for multi-instance learning remain almost untouched. In this paper, we propose a framework called Multi-Instance MEtric Learning (MIMEL) to learn an appropriate distance under the multi-instance setting. The distance metric between two bags is defined using the Mahalanobis distance function. The problem is formulated by minimizing the KL divergence between two multivariate Gaussians under the constraints of maximizing the between-class bag distance and minimizing the within-class bag distance. To exploit the mechanism of how instances determine bag labels in multi-instance learning, we design a nonparametric density-estimation-based weighting scheme to assign higher ""weights"" to the instances that are more likely to be positive in positive bags. The weighting scheme itself has a small workload, which adds little extra computing costs to the proposed framework. Moreover, to further boost the classification accuracy, a kernel version of MIMEL is presented. We evaluate MIMEL, using not only several typical multi-instance tasks, but also two activity recognition datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that MIMEL achieves better classification accuracy than many state-of-the-art distance based algorithms or kernel methods for multi-instance learning.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-0-7695-4408-3; POD:978-1-4577-2075-8","10.1109/ICDM.2011.106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137292","Metric learning;Multi-instance learning;Weighting scheme","Data mining;Kernel;Learning systems;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Measurement;Training","Gaussian processes;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence)","KL divergence minimization;MIMEL;Mahalanobis distance function;between-class bag distance maximization;classification accuracy;data mining task;distance metrics;machine learning task;multiinstance metric learning;multivariate Gaussians;nonparametric density-estimation-based weighting scheme;within-class bag distance minimization","","7","","44","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike most approaches which typically decompose a multitask multiclass problem into multiple multitask binary classification problems, our approach can learning multitask multiclass problems directly and effectively. This paper also derives the dual optimization which indicates the relations between tasks. The linear multitask multiclass learning method can be generalized to non-linear cases by the kernel trick. Experimental results indicate that the new approach can get encouraging results for multitask multiclass problems.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-0-7695-4409-0; POD:978-1-4673-0005-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2011.126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137422","Kernel;Multiclass classification;Multitask learning;Regularization;Support vector machine","Correlation;Kernel;Learning systems;Machine learning;Optimization;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;support vector machines","classification method;constrained optimization problem;dual optimization;kernel trick;multiple multitask binary classification problems;multitask learning;multitask multiclass support vector machines;quadratic objective function;regularization principle","","4","","17","","","11-11 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are a myriad of approaches to concept drift handling which have been shown to handle concept drift with varying degrees of success. However, most approaches make the key assumption that the labelled data will be available at no labelling cost shortly after classification, an assumption which is often violated. The high labelling cost in many domains provides a strong motivation to reduce the number of labelled instances required to handle concept drift. Explicit detection approaches that do not require labelled instances to detect concept drift show great promise for achieving this. Our approach Confidence Distribution Batch Detection (CDBD) provides a signal correlated to changes in concept without using labelled data. We also show how this signal combined with a trigger and a rebuild policy can maintain classifier accuracy while using a limited amount of labelled data.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-0-7695-4409-0; POD:978-1-4673-0005-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2011.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137435","classifier confidence;concept drift;explicit drift detection;labelling cost","Accuracy;Conferences;Data mining;Labeling;Machine learning;Training;Training data","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence)","CDBD;concept drift;confidence distribution batch detection;drift detection;explicit detection;machine learning;uncertainty distribution divergence","","2","","18","","","11-11 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Univ., Singapore, Singapore","2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining","20120123","2011","","","577","586","Domain Adaptation (DA) methods are usually carried out by means of simply reducing the marginal distribution differences between the source and target domains, and subsequently using the resultant trained classifier, namely source classifier, for use in the target domain. However, in many cases, the true predictive distributions of the source and target domains can be vastly different especially when their class distributions are skewed, causing the issues of sample selection bias in DA. Hence, DA methods which leverage the source labeled data may suffer from poor generalization in the target domain, resulting in negative transfer. In addition, we observed that many DA methods use either a source classifier or a linear combination of source classifiers with a fixed weighting for predicting the target unlabeled data. Essentially, the labels of the target unlabeled data are spanned by the prediction of these source classifiers. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we propose to construct many source classifiers of diverse biases and learn the weight for each source classifier by directly minimizing the structural risk defined on the target unlabeled data so as to heal the possible sample selection bias. Since the weights are learned by maximizing the margin of separation between opposite classes on the target unlabeled data, the proposed method is established here as Maximal Margin Target Label Learning (MMTLL), which is in a form of Multiple Kernel Learning problem with many label kernels. Extensive experimental studies of MMTLL against several state-of-the-art methods on the Sentiment and Newsgroups datasets with various imbalanced class settings showed that MMTLL exhibited robust accuracies on all the settings considered and was resilient to negative transfer, in contrast to other counterpart methods which suffered significantly in prediction accuracy.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-0-7695-4408-3; POD:978-1-4577-2075-8","10.1109/ICDM.2011.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137262","Classifier Selection;Domain Adaptation;Maximum Margin Separation;Multiple Kernel Learning;Negative Transfer;Sample Selection Bias","Accuracy;Complexity theory;Joints;Kernel;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","domain adaptation methods;marginal distribution differences;maximal margin target label learning;negative transfer;newsgroups datasets;predictive distributions;sample selection bias;sentiment datasets;source classifier selection;structural risk minimization;target unlabeled data;trained classifier","","7","","33","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A feature selection method is required to be general enough to find representative features from training data, which are then used for classifying test patterns. The situation where the features selected from the training data are quite different from the representative features of the testing data is called over-selecting. The main causes of the over-selecting phenomenon are: non-comprehensive consideration of statistical properties of the training data, heuristic search strategies for feature selection and small sample size of the data set for training. In this paper, we show the influence of the over-selecting phenomenon on the over-fitting phenomenon of machine learning algorithms. We propose a new framework to address principal causes of over-selecting and thus reduce the chance of over-fitting. Our new framework that we call Ensemble Feature Selection measure (EnFS), allows to consider many statistical properties of a given data set at the same time by combining many feature selection methods used in the filter model. From the chosen feature selection measures, a new combined measure is constructed. We also propose a new search algorithm that ensures the globally optimal feature subsets by means of the constructed measure. The new search approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming (M01LP) problem by means of the branch-and-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear in the number of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our EnFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application. Experimental results obtained over the KDD CUP'99 benchmarking data set for IDS show that our EnFS measure is capable of reducing over-fitting by addressing over-selecting.","2164-7143;21647143","Electronic:978-1-4577-1676-8; POD:978-1-4799-1697-9","10.1109/ISDA.2011.6121657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121657","correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 0–1 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 0–1 fractional programming","Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Polynomials;Programming;Testing;Training;Training data","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;pattern recognition;security of data;set theory;tree searching","EnFS measure;branch-and- bound algorithm;ensemble feature selection measures;globally optimal feature subsets;heuristic search strategy;intrusion detection system;linear programming problem;machine learning algorithm;noncomprehensive consideration;over fitting phenomenon;pattern recognition system;representative feature;statistical property;test pattern classification","","0","","15","","","22-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As performance measure, we use the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and its reformulation in terms of graphs. For the three-class case, this results in a new type of cycle transitivity for pairwise AUCs that can be verified by solving an integer quadratic program.

Recent approaches to monotone prediction consider linear ordering on attribute domains, thus the meaning of being better in an attribute is limited to having a larger or a lower value in that attribute. However, this limitation restricts the use of recent approaches in cases where middle or marginal values of an attribute are better, what is natural in many real-world scenarios. We present a simple attribute value-transformation approach in this paper. The idea is to map attribute domains to real values where the mapped values express how the given value of an attribute contributes to higher classification of objects. Thus, we are searching for an data-specific approximation of a fuzzy membership function on the domain of each (numerical) attribute. Then, instead of the original attribute values we use their mapped values to mitigate the violation of monotonicity constraints in the data. Our approach is quite simple and is not limited to numerical attributes only. The described approach was tested and evaluated on benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0045-3; POD:978-1-4577-0044-6","10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108533","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6108533","","Approximation methods;Correlation;Electronic mail;Labeling;Machine learning;Noise;Prediction algorithms","function approximation;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;prediction theory","UCI machine learning repository;attribute value-transformation approach;data specific approximation;fuzzy membership function approximation;monotone prediction prediction;monotonicity constraint","","0","","25","","","21-22 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The extracted pseudo-labeled samples are then used as the initial training data to perform semi-supervised learning for sentiment classification. Experimental results across four domains show that our approach using emotion keywords is capable of extracting pseudo-labeled samples with high precision (about 90%).

Experiment results shows that our method has performed much better, compared with the semi supervised fuzzy pattern matching algorithm proposed in [9].","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4584-4; POD:978-1-4577-2008-6","10.1109/CIS.2011.106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6128162","dynamic fuzzy possibility;dynamic fuzzy sets;fuzzy pattern matching;multitask learning;semisupervsed learning","Classification algorithms;Error analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Histograms;Machine learning;Semisupervised learning","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;possibility theory","dynamic fuzzy possibility;dynamic fuzzy semisupervised multitask learning;machine learning field;membership functions;semisupervised fuzzy pattern matching algorithm","","0","","27","","","3-4 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
