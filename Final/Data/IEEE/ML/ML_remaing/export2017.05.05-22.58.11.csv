The question we ask is how to include the information that data are aging. Ad hoc methods to achieve this include the use of validity windows that prevent the learning machine from making inferences based on old data. This introduces the problem of how to define the size of validity windows. In this brief, a new adaptive Bayesian inspired algorithm is presented for learning drifting concepts. It uses the analogy of validity windows in an adaptive Bayesian way to incorporate changes in the data distribution over time. We apply a theoretical approach based on information geometry to the classification problem and measure its performance in simulations. The uncertainty about the appropriate size of the memory windows is dealt with in a Bayesian manner by integrating over the distribution of the adaptive window size. Thus, the posterior distribution of the weights may develop algebraic tails. The learning algorithm results from tracking the mean and variance of the posterior distribution of the weights. It was found that the algebraic tails of this posterior distribution give the learning algorithm the ability to cope with an evolving environment by permitting the escape from local traps.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2046422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453021","Online Bayesian algorithms;pattern classification;time-varying environment","Aging;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Entropy;Inference algorithms;Information geometry;Machine learning;Pattern classification;Probability distribution;Solid modeling","inference mechanisms;pattern classification;statistical distributions","Bayesian inspired algorithm;ad hoc methods;adaptive window size;aging information;classification problem;data collection;data distribution;information geometry;learning tasks;posterior distribution","0","3","","16","","20100422","June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

From this intuition, we develop a novel multi-class margin definition for the unlabeled data, and an iterative deterministic annealing-style training algorithm maximizing both the multi-class margin of labeled and unlabeled samples. In particular, this allows us to use the predicted labels of the unlabeled data as additional optimization variables. Furthermore, we propose a control mechanism based on the out-of-bag error, which prevents the algorithm from degradation if the unlabeled data is not useful for the task.

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical machine learning approach to tackle the problem of tubular structure parsing in medical imaging. It has a progressive three-tiered classification process at volumetric voxel level, vessel segment level, and inter-segment level. Generative models are employed to project from low-level, ambiguous data to class-conditional probabilities; and discriminative classifiers are trained on the upper-level structural patterns of probabilities to label and parse the vessel segments. Our method is validated by experiments of detecting and segmenting clinically defined coronary arteries, from the initial noisy vessel segment networks generated by low-level heuristics-based tracing algorithms.

At initial stage of POS-tagging for Malayalam, the model is trained with a very limited resource of annotated corpus. We tried to maximize the performance with this a substantial amount of annotated corpus. The objective of this project was to identify the ambiguities in Malayalam lexical items and develop an efficient and accurate POS Tagger. We have developed our own tagset for training and testing the POS-tagger generators. The present tagset consists of 29 tags.

The contributions of this work are twofold: (i) we describe a feature basis which is able to capture shape information and which is illumination invariant. Furthermore, the feature set is guaranteed to be generally applicable due to its high flexibility, (ii) we present an interactive ensemble learning algorithm based on randomized trees, which can cope with exceptionally high dimensional feature spaces in an efficient manner.

Specifically, we establish a parametric space where these local models lie and spread as a manifold-like structure, and use boosting to perform local model training by completing the manifold embedding. Via sharing the common embedding space, the learning of each local model can be properly regularized by the extra knowledge from other models, while the training time is also significantly reduced.

The data association criteria is based on the underlying probability distribution of the data points which is defined in advance via the employed distance metric. In many problem domains, the initially designed distance metric fails to resolve the ambiguities in the clustering process. We present a novel semi-supervised kernel mean shift algorithm where the inherent structure of the data points is learned with a few user supplied constraints in addition to the original metric. The constraints we consider are the pairs of points that should be clustered together. The data points are implicitly mapped to a higher dimensional space induced by the kernel function where the constraints can be effectively enforced. The mode seeking is then performed on the embedded space and the approach preserves all the advantages of the original mean shift algorithm.

Thereby the identification and classification of traffic play an important role for increasing the performance in network management. Primitive applications were using well-known ports in transport layer, so their traffic classification can be performed based on the port number. However, the recent applications progressively use unpredictable port numbers. Consequently the later methods are based on “deep packet inspection”. Notwithstanding proper accuracy, these methods impose heavy operational load and are vulnerable to encrypted flows. The recent methods classify the traffic based on statistical packet characteristics. However, having access to a little part of statistical flow information in real-time traffic may jeopardize the performance of these methods. Regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the two later methods, in this paper we propose an approach based on payload content and statistical traffic characteristics with Naive Bayes algorithm for real-time network traffic classification.

In contrast to the existing work that focuses on modeling the object using the images only; we exploit the information on the image sequences and their relative 3D positions, because under many circumstances the movements between multi-views are accessible and can be controlled by the users. Thus we can calculate the next optimal place to take a picture based on previous behaviors, and perform the object/pose recognition based on these obtained images. The proposed method uses HOG (Histograms of Oriented Gradient) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) as the basic object/pose classifier. To learn the optimal action, this algorithm makes use of a boosting method to find the best sequence across the multi-views. Then it exploits the relation between the different view points using the Adaboost algorithm. The experiment shows that the learned sequence improves recognition performance in early steps compared to a randomly selected sequence, and the proposed algorithm can achieve a better recognition accuracy than the baseline method.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4124-2; Electronic:978-1-4244-4441-0; POD:978-1-4244-4442-7","10.1109/ICCVW.2009.5457643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457643","","Histograms;Image recognition;Image sequences;Machine learning algorithms;Object detection;Object recognition;Robots;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Turning","gradient methods;image motion analysis;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;pose estimation;support vector machines","3D position;Adaboost algorithm;active view selection;boosting method;histograms of oriented gradient;image sequence;multiview object recognition;multiview sequence;pose recognition;recognition accuracy;recognition performance;support vector machine","","3","","16","","","Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies the robustness of on-line boosting. Since mainly the applied loss function determines the behavior of boosting, we propose an on-line version of GradientBoost, which allows us to plug in arbitrary loss-functions into the on-line learner. Hence, we can easily study the importance and the behavior of different loss-functions. We evaluate various on-line boosting algorithms in form of a competitive study on standard machine learning problems as well as on common computer vision applications such as tracking and autonomous training of object detectors.

This limits the number of different cues that the SFS problem can exploit. In this paper, we show how machine learning can be applied to an SFS model with a large number of parameters. Our system learns a set of weighting parameters that use the intensity of each pixel in the image to gauge the importance of that pixel in the shape reconstruction process. We show empirically that this leads to a significant increase in the accuracy of the recovered surfaces. Our learning approach is novel in that the parameters are optimized with respect to actual surface output by the system. In the first, offline phase, a hemisphere is rendered using a known illumination direction. The isophotes in the resulting reflectance map are then modelled using Gaussian mixtures to obtain a parametric representation of the isophotes. This Gaussian parameterization is then used in the second phase to learn intensity-based weights using a database of 3D shapes. The weights can also be optimized for a particular input image.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4124-2; Electronic:978-1-4244-4441-0; POD:978-1-4244-4442-7","10.1109/ICCVW.2009.5457444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457444","","Computer vision;Conferences;Databases;Image reconstruction;Machine learning;Partial differential equations;Pixel;Shape;Surface reconstruction;Training data","Gaussian processes;image reconstruction;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);reflectivity;shape recognition;visual databases","3D shapes;Gaussian parameterization;SFS problem;illumination direction;intensity-based weights;isophotes;machine learning;many-parameter shape-from-shading models;offline phase;pixel;reflectance map;shape reconstruction;surface database;weighting parameter set","","7","","24","","","Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much machine learning methods has been done on automatic semantic image classification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic classification of images based on weighted feature support vector machine(WFSVM). For image classification, the image data usually have a large number of feature dimensions. Traditional image classification algorithms based on the SVM assign equal weights to these features. However, the computing of kernel function of SVM may be dominated by trivial relevant or irrelevant features. The novelty of this paper is that we take the importance of each feature with respect to the classification task into account. Firstly, we determine the relevant features according to their degree of discrete and assign greater weight to relevant features, discard the irrelevant features. Secondly, we utilize the weighted features to compute the kernel functions and train the SVM. Finally, the trained SVM has been used to the new images automatic classification task. Experimental results based on COREL database show that the WFSVM has two advantages than the traditional SVM: the better performance of generalization ability and higher speed of training time.","2157-1473;21571473","Electronic:978-1-4244-5739-7; POD:978-1-4244-5001-5","10.1109/ICMTMA.2010.549","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460008","Support Vector Machine(SVM);content-based retrieval;semantic image classification;weighted feature","Classification algorithms;Content based retrieval;Image classification;Image retrieval;Kernel;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Organizing;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image classification;image retrieval;support vector machines;visual databases","COREL database;SVM kernel function;content-based image retrieval;machine learning methods;semantic image classification;weighted feature support vector machines method","","2","","19","","","13-14 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This field addresses a broad range of problems of significant practical interest, namely, the recovery of a data matrix from what appears to be incomplete, and perhaps even corrupted, information. In its simplest form, the problem is to recover a matrix from a small sample of its entries. It comes up in many areas of science and engineering, including collaborative filtering, machine learning, control, remote sensing, and computer vision, to name a few. This paper surveys the novel literature on matrix completion, which shows that under some suitable conditions, one can recover an unknown low-rank matrix from a nearly minimal set of entries by solving a simple convex optimization problem, namely, nuclear-norm minimization subject to data constraints. Further, this paper introduces novel results showing that matrix completion is provably accurate even when the few observed entries are corrupted with a small amount of noise. A typical result is that one can recover an unknown matrix of low rank from just about log noisy samples with an error that is proportional to the noise level. We present numerical results that complement our quantitative analysis and show that, in practice, nuclear-norm minimization accurately fills in the many missing entries of large low-rank matrices from just a few noisy samples. Some analogies between matrix completion and compressed sensing are discussed throughout.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2035722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5454406","Compressed sensing;duality in optimization;low-rank matrices;matrix completion;nuclear-norm minimization;oracle inequalities;semidefinite programming","Collaboration;Compressed sensing;Computer vision;Filtering;Frequency;Linear matrix inequalities;Machine learning;Motion pictures;Noise level;Remote sensing","data integrity;matrix algebra;minimisation;noise;signal sampling","compressed sensing;convex optimization problem;data constraints;low rank matrices;matrix completion;nuclear norm minimization","","334","","35","","20100426","June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The other is to train a metric for each category in a 1-vs-all manner. While the former approach seems to be at a disadvantage in terms of performance, the latter is not practical for large numbers of categories. In this paper we explore the space in between these two extremes.

Information theoretic measures have been used for sampling the data, retaining its original information content. We propose an efficient Rényi entropy based subset selection algorithm. The algorithm is first validated and then applied to two sample applications where machine learning and data pruning are used. In the first application, Gaussian process regression is used to learn object pose. Here it is shown that the algorithm combined with the subset selection is significantly more efficient.

Silverstein","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan","IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","20100513","2010","4","3","468","480","The detection problem in statistical signal processing can be succinctly formulated: given m (possibly) signal bearing, n -dimensional signal-plus-noise snapshot vectors (samples) and <i>N</i> statistically independent n-dimensional noise-only snapshot vectors, can one reliably infer the presence of a signal? This problem arises in the context of applications as diverse as radar, sonar, wireless communications, bioinformatics, and machine learning and is the critical first step in the subsequent signal parameter estimation phase. The signal detection problem can be naturally posed in terms of the sample generalized eigenvalues. The sample generalized eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by ?whitening? the signal-plus-noise sample covariance matrix with the noise-only sample covariance matrix. In this paper, we prove a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample generalized eigenvalue-based detection of signals in arbitrarily colored noise when there are relatively few signal bearing and noise-only samples. Specifically, we show why when the (eigen) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is below a critical value, that is a simple function of n , m, and N, then reliable signal detection, in an asymptotic sense, is not possible. If, however, the eigen-SNR is above this critical value then a simple, new random matrix theory-based algorithm, which we present here, will reliably detect the signal even at SNRs close to the critical value. Numerical simulations highlight the accuracy of our analytical prediction, permit us to extend our heuristic definition of the effective number of identifiable signals in colored noise and display the dramatic improvement in performance relative to the classical estimator by Zhao We discuss implications of our result for the detection of weak and/or closely spaced signals in sensor array processing, abrupt change detection in sensor networks, and clustering methodologies in machine learning.","1932-4553;19324553","","10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447639","Multivariate F distribution;Wishart distribution;random matrices;sample covariance matrix;signal detection","Biomedical signal processing;Colored noise;Covariance matrix;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Machine learning;Radar signal processing;Sensor arrays;Signal detection;Signal processing;Signal to noise ratio","array signal processing;covariance matrices;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;signal detection;signal sampling","arbitrarily colored noise;machine learning;noise-only samples;sample generalized eigenvalue;sensor array processing;signal bearing;signal detection;signal parameter estimation phase;signal-bearing samples;signal-plus-noise sample covariance matrix;signal-plus-noise snapshot vectors;statistical signal processing","","48","","46","","20100415","June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although small scale DBNs have shown great potential, the computational cost of RBM training has been a major challenge in scaling to large networks. In this paper we present a highly scalable architecture for Deep Belief Net processing on hardware systems that can handle hundreds of boards, if not more, of customized logic with near linear performance increase. We elucidate tradeoffs between flexibility in the neuron connections, and the hardware resources, such as memory and communication bandwidth, required to build a custom processor design that has optimal efficiency. We illustrate how our architecture can easily support sparse networks with dense regions of connections between neighboring sets of neurons, which is relevant to applications where there are obvious spatial correlations in the data, such as in image processing. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by implementing a multi-FPGA system. We show that a speedup of 46X-112X over an optimized single core CPU implementation can be achieved for a four-FPGA implementation.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7143-0; POD:978-1-4244-7142-3","10.1109/FCCM.2010.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474047","Boltzmann machines;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Large-scale systems;Neural network hardware;Parallel processing","Bandwidth;Computational efficiency;Computer architecture;Hardware;Image processing;Large-scale systems;Logic;Machine learning;Neurons;Process design","Boltzmann machines;field programmable gate arrays;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons","RBM training;customized logic;deep belief nets;field programmable gate array;large-scale architecture;machine learning domain;multiFPGA system;neuron connections;restricted Boltzmann machines","","9","1","13","","","2-4 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly detection is an approach of intrusion detection that constructs models of normal behavior of users or systems and detects the behaviors that deviate from the model. Monitoring the sequences of system calls generated during the execution of privileged programs has been known to be an effective means of anomaly detection. In this paper, an approach for anolymal intrusion detection is presented and applied to monitor the abnormal behavior of processes. The approach is based on rough set theory and capable of extracting a set of rules with the minimum size to form a normal behavior model from the record of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process. It may detect the abnormal operating status of a process. The normal behavior model in terms of the system call sequences is defined.

Conventional algorithms are likely to fail with such spatial-temporal ambiguities. In this work, the candidate regions of an action are treated as a bag of instances. Then a novel multiple-instance learning framework, named SMILE-SVM (Simulated annealing Multiple Instance LEarning Support Vector Machines), is presented for learning human action detector based on imprecise action locations. SMILE-SVM is extensively evaluated with satisfactory performances on two tasks: (1) human action detection on a public video action database with cluttered backgrounds, and (2) a real world problem of detecting whether the customers in a shopping mall show an intention to purchase the merchandise on shelf (even if they didn't buy it eventually).

It is often assumed that the data has some interesting low-dimensional structure, for example that of a d-dimensional manifold M, with d much smaller than D. When M is simply a linear subspace, one may exploit this assumption for encoding efficiently the data by projecting onto a dictionary of d vectors in Â¿<sup>D</sup> (for example found by SVD), at a cost (d + n)D for n data points. When M is nonlinear, there are no ""explicit"" constructions of dictionaries that achieve a similar efficiency: typically one uses either random dictionaries, or dictionaries obtained by black-box optimization. In this paper we construct data-dependent multiscale dictionaries that aim at efficient encoding and manipulating of the data. Their construction is fast, and so are the algorithms to map data points to dictionary coefficients and vice versa. In addition, data points are guaranteed to have a sparse representation in terms of the dictionary. We think of dictionaries as the analogue of wavelets, but for approximating point clouds rather than functions.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7417-2; POD:978-1-4244-7416-5","10.1109/CISS.2010.5464843","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464843","Data Sets;Frames;Multiscale Analysis;Point Clouds;Sparse Approximation;Wavelets","Clouds;Dictionaries;Encoding;Machine learning;Manifolds;Mathematics;Optimization methods;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Wavelet analysis","data handling;database management systems;optimisation;wavelet transforms","black box optimization;data dependent multiscale dictionaries;data encoding;data manipulation;data sets;multiscale geometric wavelets;point clouds analysis","","5","","15","","","17-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This information is often used for debugging, operational profiling, finding anomalies, detecting security threats, measuring performance etc. The log files are usually too big for extracting this valuable information manually, even though manual perusal is still one of the more widely used techniques. Recently a variety of data mining and machine learning algorithms are being used to analyze the information in the log files. A major road block for the efficient use of these algorithms is the inherent variability present in every log line of a log file. Each log line is a combination of a static message type field and a variable parameter field. Even though both these fields are required, the analyses algorithm often requires that these be separated out, in order to find correlations in the repeating log event types. This disentangling of the message and parameter fields to find the event types is called abstraction of log lines. Each log line is abstracted to a unique ID or event type and the dynamic parameter value is extracted to give an insight on the current state of the system.

An intrusion detection method based on neural network and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOA) is presented in this paper. The novel structure model has higher accuracy and faster convergence speed. With the ability of strong self-learning and faster convergence, this intrusion detection method can detect various intrusion behaviors rapidly and effectively by learning the typical intrusion characteristic information. Utilizing the character that rough set can keep the discernability of original dataset after reduction, the reduces of the original dataset are calculated and used to train neural network, which increase the detection accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a Generalized Query by Transduction (GQBT) approach for active learning in the online setting. This approach is based on the theory of conformal predictions, which has recently been proposed based on principles of algorithmic randomness, transductive inference and hypothesis testing. The proposed GQBT approach can be used along with any existing pattern classification algorithm, and can also be used to combine multiple criteria in selecting an unlabeled example appropriately in the active learning process. The results of our experiments with different datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository demonstrate high promise in the proposed approach, with significantly lower label complexities than other existing online active learning approaches. The GQBT approach was also evaluated on face recognition using videos from the VidTIMIT dataset, and the observed superior performance supports the potential of applicability of the proposed approach in real-world problems.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4124-2; Electronic:978-1-4244-4441-0; POD:978-1-4244-4442-7","10.1109/ICCVW.2009.5457449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457449","","Classification algorithms;Conferences;Face recognition;Inference algorithms;Machine learning;Pattern classification;Testing;Ubiquitous computing;Uncertainty;Videos","inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;query processing;random processes","UCI machine learning repository;algorithmic randomness;generalized query;hypothesis testing;multiple criteria;online active learning;pattern classification;transductive inference","","7","","26","","","Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a generalization of the one class support vector machines (1-SVMs) to accommodate spatial interactions, which is further incorporated into an online learning framework to track temporal changes. As a result it yields a closed-form update formula, a central component of the proposed algorithm to enable prompt adaptation to spatio-temporal changes. We also analyze the mistake bound and discuss issues such as dealing with non-stationary distributions, making use of kernels and efficient inference by a variant of dynamic programming. By exploiting the inherently concurrent structure, the proposed approach is designed to work with the highly parallel graphics processors (GPUs) to facilitate realtime analysis.

The fragments are today spread out in libraries and private collections worldwide, and there is an onging effort to document and catalogue all extant fragments. The task of finding joins is currently conducted manually by experts, and presumably only a small fraction of the existing joins have been discovered. In this work, we study the problem of automatically finding candidate joins, so as to streamline the task. The proposed method is based on a combination of local descriptors and learning techniques. To evaluate the performance of various join-finding methods, without relying on the availability of human experts, we construct a benchmark dataset that is modeled on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark for face recognition. Using this benchmark, we evaluate several alternative image representations and learning techniques.
