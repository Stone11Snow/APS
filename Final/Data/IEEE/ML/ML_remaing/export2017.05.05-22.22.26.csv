In this paper, an intelligent earlywarning system to achieve reliable online detection of risky operating conditions is proposed. The proposed intelligent system (IS) consists of an ensemble learning model based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and a decision-making process under a multi-objective programming (MOP) framework. Taking an ensemble form, the randomness existing in individual ELM training is generalized and reliable classification results can be obtained. The decision-making is designed for ELM ensemble whose parameters are optimized to search for the optimal tradeoff between the warning accuracy and the warning earliness of the proposed IS. The compromise solution turns out to significantly speed up the overall computation with an acceptable sacrifice in the accuracy (e.g. from 100% to 99.9%). More importantly, the proposed IS can provide multiple and switchable performances to the operators in order to satisfy different local dynamic security assessment (DSA) requirements.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2017.2676879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7869388","Dynamic insecurity risk;early warning;extreme learning machine;intelligent system;multi-objective programming","Computational modeling;Databases;Electronic mail;Power system dynamics;Power system stability;Reliability;Training","","","","","","","","20170302","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to the sensitivity of forecasting issues in market's performance, and high prediction error resulted from the behavior of price series, nowadays probabilistic forecasting highly attracted participants' attention. In this paper, a probabilistic approach for the hourly electricity price forecasting is presented. In the proposed method, the uncertainty of predictor model is considered as the uncertainty factor. The bootstrapping technique is used to implement the uncertainty and since the method is needed to be fast and of low computational cost in the daily forecasting, a generalized learning method is applied, which has high accuracy and speed. This newly presented learning method is based on generalized extreme learning machine approach to be used for improved wavelet neural networks. Also in order to reach more accommodation, the predictor model with the changes of price time series, the wavelet preprocessing is used.

The purpose is to implement aware agents (A-agents) on portable/wearable computing devices (P/WCD). The proposed protocol is useful to reduce the calculation cost on the P/WCD. The basic idea of the protocol is to divide an ELM-based A-agent into two parts, one containing the weights of hidden layer(s) and the other containing the weights of the output layer. The former is implemented in the remote server and the latter is implemented in the P/WCD. In addition, the input data are first encrypted in the P/WCD using transposition cipher, and then sent to the server. Because the server can only “see” random weights and encrypted data, the user intention and privacy can be protected. In addition, since part of the computations is executed on the server, the cost for implementing A-agents in the P/WCD can be reduced. Experimental results on several public databases show that the proposed protocol is useful if the dimension of the input data is high.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4240-1; POD:978-1-5090-4241-8","10.1109/SSCI.2016.7850191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7850191","extreme learning machine;portable computing device;privacy preserving cloud-based computing","Ciphers;Encryption;Privacy;Protocols;Servers;Training","cloud computing;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols","ELM-based A-agents;ELM-based privacy preserving protocol;P/WCD;aware agents;cloud system utilization;encrypted data;extreme learning machine;portable/wearable computing devices;public databases;remote server;transposition cipher","","","","","","","6-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although, it provides promising performance and robustness and has been used for various applications, the single-layer architecture possibly lacks the effectiveness when applied for natural signals. In order to over come this shortcoming, the following work indicates a new architecture based on multilayer network framework. The significant contribution of this paper are as follows: 1) unlike existing multilayer ELM, in which hidden nodes are obtained randomly, in this paper all hidden layers with invertible functions are calculated by pulling the network output back and putting it into hidden layers. Thus, the feature learning is enriched by additional information, which results in better performance; 2) in contrast to the existing multilayer network methods, which are usually efficient for classification applications, the proposed architecture is implemented for dimension reduction and image reconstruction; and 3) unlike other iterative learning-based deep networks (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed method are obtained via four steps. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than DL. Experimental results on 33 datasets indicate that, in comparison to the other existing dimension reduction techniques, the proposed method performs competitively better with fast training speeds.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2016.2637279","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797236","Autoencoder;deep learning (DL);dimension reduction;extreme learning machine (ELM);feature selection;generalization performance","Artificial neural networks;Decoding;Encoding;Image reconstruction;Learning systems;Nonhomogeneous media;Training","","","","","","","","20161223","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Clearly, if F is a very high, or even infinitely, dimensional space, designing such a receiver may be a computationally intractable problem. However, using Mercer kernels, this problem can be solved without explicitly mapping the data to F. Recently, a powerful method of obtaining nonlinear kernel Fisher discriminants (KFDs) has been proposed, and very promising results were reported when compared with the other state-of-the-art classification techniques. In this paper, we present an extension of the KFD method that is also based on Mercer kernels. Our approach, which is called the nonlinear kernel second-order discriminant (KSOD), consists of determining a nonlinear receiver via optimization of a general form of second-order measures of performance. We also propose a complexity control procedure in order to improve the performance of these classifiers when few training data are available. Finally, simulations compare our approach with the KFD method.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2004.834346","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337248","Kernel Fisher discriminant;learning machine;second-order criteria;support vector machines","Frequency estimation;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine learning;Signal design;Signal to noise ratio;Space technology;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","nonlinear functions;optimisation;receivers;signal classification","Mercer kernel;high-dimensional feature space;improved training algorithm;nonlinear Fisher kernel discriminants;nonlinear function;nonlinear kernel second-order discriminants;nonlinear receiver;state-of-the-art classification techniques","","12","","29","","","Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In comparison with the numerical ratios derived from financial reports, we believe textual information derived from financial media news reports provides much more essential and valuable cues pertaining to the existence of corporate financial difficulties, because the preparations of financial reports have to satisfy some selective accounting principle or estimation method determination. How to effectively and efficiently handle a large amount of textual content is an important in this explosive information period of big data analytics. To deal with the aforementioned challenge, this study implements a latent topic modelling technique and text mining technique to construct the “Intensity of Performance-Corpus Index” (IPCI), which can compress tremendous amounts of textual information into more manageable essential synthesized parts and then use them to forecast corporate operating performance. To our knowledge, current research has not yet constructed a forecasting model for corporate operating performance that simultaneously integrates numerical and textual information content. To fill the gap in the literature, this study combines numerical and textual information contents and uses them to construct a novel forecasting mechanism. With superior forecasting performance that is supported by real cases, the introduced mechanism can assist both market participants (such as bankers, investors, and creditors) and public sectors (such as Financial Supervisory Commission and Ministry of Economic Affairs) in allocating economic resources to form their own judgement as well as to promote the proper media circulation of business events.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1897-0; POD:978-1-5090-1898-7; USB:978-1-5090-1819-2","10.1109/SMC.2016.7844365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7844365","decision making;extreme learning machine;latent topic modelling;text mining","Atmospheric measurements;Biological system modeling;Forecasting;Media;Numerical models;Predictive models;Sun","Big Data;data mining;financial data processing;text analysis","4V;Big Data analytics;IPCI;Intensity of Performance-Corpus Index;business events;corporate financial difficulties;corporate future development;economic resource allocation;financial information;financial media news reports;financial reports;financial supervisory commission;forecasting mechanism;forecasting model;forecasting performance;latent topic modelling;market participants;media circulation;numerical ratios;public sectors;salient corporate performance forecasting;selective accounting principle;text mining;textual content;textual information contents;valuable cues;velocity volume variety veracity","","","","","","","9-12 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional nonadaptive models, which are usually adopted for this task in simple CBIR systems, do not adequately capture all aspects of the characteristics of the human visual system. An effective way of addressing this problem is to adopt a ""human-computer"" interactive approach, where the users directly teach the system about what they regard as being significant image features and their own notions of image similarity. We propose a machine learning approach for this task, which allows users to directly modify query characteristics by specifying their attributes in the form of training examples. Specifically, we apply a radial-basis function (RBF) network for implementing an adaptive metric which progressively models the notion of image similarity through continual relevance feedback from users. Experimental results show that the proposed methods not only outperform conventional CBIR systems in terms of both accuracy and robustness, but also previously proposed interactive systems.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2004.834866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335477","Content-based image retrieval;digital library;machine learning;nonlinear human perception;radial basis function network;relevance feedback","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feedback;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Robustness;Shape;Visual system","content-based retrieval;digital libraries;human computer interaction;image retrieval;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks;relevance feedback;visual databases;visual perception","CBIR system;RBF network;content-based image retrieval system;digital library;human-computer interface;image similarity;interactive system;machine learning;nonlinear human perception;radial-basis function;relevance feedback;visual information","","46","","35","","","Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Closed-loop control instead of open-loop control have been adopted in SEPIC converters, and the fault prognostic methods used for open-loop converters sometimes are no longer suitable for closed-loop converters. Besides, the system-level fault feature parameters (FFP) is often influenced not only by the fault modes, but also by the variation of working conditions. To address these problems, an innovative system-level FFP represents the degradation status of the entire converter under variable operating conditions is extracted, and a prognostic method based on the degradation trend of the FFP is proposed. Firstly, the deterioration laws of some system-level parameters with the change of critical components under different operating conditions are studied. Then, a system-level performance parameter of closed-loop SEPIC converters which is sensitive to the degradation of all critical components and has regular trend is chosen, and the degradation performance parameter under rated operating condition is obtained as FFP by multivariate least-squares regression. Finally, the trend prediction of the FFP is performed based on Extreme learning machine (ELM) to realize the prognosis of closed-loop SEPIC converters.

Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in the previous work.

Most of the existing tracking methods rely on either received signal strength (RSS) or phase shift alone. This paper presents a new RFID tracking method that fuses the RSS and phase shift together to predict the instant position of a mobile target. The fingerprints database is first constructed by collecting the RSS values at reference points. After data normalization, the fingerprints are fed into the extreme learning machine for the rough position estimation. The radial speed of the RFID tag can be calculated by measuring the phase difference between two consecutive time steps. Then, the linear least squares method is exploited to fit the instant speed of the mobile tag. On the assumption that the trajectory of the mobile tag could be approximated by a series of line segments, the Kalman filter is utilized afterward to enhance the position estimation by combing the rough location estimation and the instant velocity. The performance of our method is studied in simulations and experimentally verified in our lab.

In the past research, various combinations of features have been employed. However, to improve the classification performance, determining the importance of each employed feature is crucially needed. In this study, feature scaling method is introduced to assign different weights for important features. Four different features are investigated in frequency domain using wavelet transform (WT). Then, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to scale the features while extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to classify between concentration and non-concentration states.

Currently speech emotion recognition systems are exclusively designed to process normal phonated speech, and can result in significantly degraded performance on whispered speech because of the fundamental differences between normal phonated speech and whispered speech in vocal excitation and vocal tract function. This study, motivated by the recent successes of feature transfer learning, sheds some light on this topic by proposing three feature transfer learning methods based on denoising autoencoders, shared-hiddenlayer autoencoders, and extreme learning machines autoencoders. Without the availability of labeled whispered speech data in the training phase, in turn, the three proposed methods can help modern emotion recognition models trained on normal phonated speech to reliably handle also whispered speech. Throughout extensive experiments on the Geneva Whispered Emotion Corpus and the Berlin Emotional Speech Database, we compare our methods to alternative methods reported to perform well for a wide range of speech emotion recognition tasks and find that the proposed methods provide significant superior performance on both normal phonated and whispered speech.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2672722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7879177","Speech emotion recognition;autoencoders;extreme learning machines;feature transfer learning;whispered speech","Acoustics;Databases;Emotion recognition;Speech;Speech processing;Speech recognition;Training","","","","","","","","20170315","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Various techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and Positron emission tomography (PET) could be used to enumerate the loss of neurons in different parts of brain. In this paper we present a novel approach for detecting PD using brain MRI scans. Because of non-invasiveness and high resolution property, MRI is preferred over other techniques. For this study, the MRI images (healthy/PD patients) have been collected from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) organization. Research efforts have stated that Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has better and accurate diagnosis ability. In this paper, PD diagnosis based on ELM-based method along with Genetic Algorithm feature subset selection has been proposed. The classifier uses voxel based morphometric features extracted from MRI. Since, the feature extracted are large in number, a feature subset selection technique using Genetic Algorithm is implemented. The performance of GA-ELM method is evaluated using classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity. The results show that the classification accuracy obtained for ELM model is higher than the one obtained using SVM approach. Also GA-ELM classifier model produces a better generalization performance with high sensitivity and low misclassification rate.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1025-7; POD:978-1-5090-1026-4","10.1109/CCIP.2016.7802848","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7802848","Extreme learning Machine algorithm;Genetic Algorithm;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);Optimization;Parkinson's disease;Support Vector Machine;Voxel-based Morphometry","Brain;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Parkinson's disease;Support vector machines","biomedical MRI;diseases;feature extraction;feature selection;genetic algorithms;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;support vector machines","GA-ELM approach;MRI images;PD detection;Parkinson disease detection;Parkinson progression markers initiative organization;SVM approach;brain MRI scans;brain structural T1-weighted MRI data;classification accuracy;classifier;dopamine progressive loss;extreme learning machine;genetic algorithm feature subset selection;neurodegenerative disorder;sensitivity;specificity;substantia nigra;voxel based morphometric feature extraction","","","","","","","12-13 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Data classification with radial basis function networks based on a novel kernel density estimation algorithm","Yen-Jen Oyang; Shien-Ching Hwang; Yu-Yen Ou; Chien-Yu Chen; Zhi-Wei Chen","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Inf. Eng., Nat. Taiwan Univ., Taiwan","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","20050131","2005","16","1","225","236","This work presents a novel learning algorithm for efficient construction of the radial basis function (RBF) networks that can deliver the same level of accuracy as the support vector machines (SVMs) in data classification applications. The proposed learning algorithm works by constructing one RBF subnetwork to approximate the probability density function of each class of objects in the training data set. With respect to algorithm design, the main distinction of the proposed learning algorithm is the novel kernel density estimation algorithm that features an average time complexity of O(nlogn), where n is the number of samples in the training data set. One important advantage of the proposed learning algorithm, in comparison with the SVM, is that the proposed learning algorithm generally takes far less time to construct a data classifier with an optimized parameter setting. This feature is of significance for many contemporary applications, in particular, for those applications in which new objects are continuously added into an already large database. Another desirable feature of the proposed learning algorithm is that the RBF networks constructed are capable of carrying out data classification with more than two classes of objects in one single run. In other words, unlike with the SVM, there is no need to resort to mechanisms such as one-against-one or one-against-all for handling datasets with more than two classes of objects. The comparison with SVM is of particular interest, because it has been shown in a number of recent studies that SVM generally are able to deliver higher classification accuracy than the other existing data classification algorithms. As the proposed learning algorithm is instance-based, the data reduction issue is also addressed in this paper. One interesting observation in this regard is that, for all three data sets used in data reduction experiments, the number of training samples remaining after a naïve data reduction mechanism is applied is quite close to the number of support vectors identified by the SVM software. This paper also compares the performance of the RBF networks constructed with the proposed learning algorithm and those constructed with a conventional cluster-based learning algorithm. The most int- eresting observation learned is that, with respect to data classification, the distributions of training samples near the boundaries between different classes of objects carry more crucial information than the distributions of samples in the inner parts of the clusters.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2004.836229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388471","Data classification;kernel density estimation;machine learning;neural network;radial basis function (RBF) network","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Kernel;Machine learning;Probability density function;Radial basis function networks;Spatial databases;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks","data classification;kernel density estimation algorithm;learning algorithm;radial basis function network;support vector machine","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computing Methodologies;Databases, Factual;Information Storage and Retrieval;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated","73","","32","","","Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While the other approach is feature learning that based on making the system identify and select the best features suit the application. The idea behind feature learning is to avoid dealing with any feature extraction or reduction algorithms and to train the suggested model on learning with avoiding the exposure to feature extraction which is mainly based on researcher experience. In this paper, Independent component analysis (ICA) will be implemented as a feature learning technique to learn the model extract the features from the input data. Deep learning approach will be proposed by implementing ICA to learn features. In the proposed model, the raw data will be read then represented by using different signal representation as Spectrogram, Wavelet and Wavelet Packet. Then, the new represented data will be fed to Independent component analysis layer to generate features and finally, the performance of the suggested scheme will be evaluated by applying different classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Extreme Learning Machine and Discriminate Analysis. And As an improving step for the results, classifier fusion layer will be implemented to select the most accurate result for both training and testing set.

Although a large amount of human PPI data has been generated by high-throughput experimental techniques, they are very limited compared to the estimated 130 000 protein interactions in humans. Hence, automatic methods for human PPI-detection are highly desired. This work proposes a novel framework, i.e., Low-rank approximation-kernel Extreme Learning Machine (LELM), for detecting human PPI from a protein's primary sequences automatically. It has three main steps: 1) mapping each protein sequence into a matrix built on all kinds of adjacent amino acids; 2) applying the low-rank approximation model to the obtained matrix to solve its lowest rank representation, which reflects its true subspace structures; and 3) utilizing a powerful kernel extreme learning machine to predict the probability for PPI based on this lowest rank representation. Experimental results on a large-scale human PPI dataset demonstrate that the proposed LELM has significant advantages in accuracy and efficiency over the state-of-art approaches. Hence, this work establishes a new and effective way for the automatic detection of PPI.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2016.2524994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7444177","Big data;feature extraction;kernel extreme learning machine (K-ELM);low-rank approximation (LRA);protein–protein interactions (PPIs);support vector machine (SVM)","Amino acids;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Kernel;Predictive models;Protein sequence","biology computing;learning (artificial intelligence);organic compounds;proteins","LELM;adjacent amino acids;biological processes;high-throughput experimental techniques;human PPI-detection;low-rank approximation-kernel extreme learning machine;lowest rank representation;protein sequence;protein-protein interactions;proteins interactions prediction","","2","","","","20160330","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, two fuzzy models of a position and position-gradient type are built on the basis of different meteorological data such as solar radiation, relative humidity, ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure etc. In order to obtain the fuzzy models for wind speed prediction, Sugeno-Yasukawa identification algorithm was employed. Next, a neuro-fuzzy model for wind speed prediction was build, based on statistical learning theory. The model presents a fuzzy inference system of Takagi-Sugeno type that uses an extended relevance vector machine for learning its parameters and number of fuzzy rules. Finally, a neural network approach was applied to build two different models for wind speed prediction based on extreme learning machine techniques. Both neural models represent single layer feedforward neural networks, with different learning algorithms. The first one applies classic extreme learning machine and the second one uses incremental extreme learning machine philosophy. The obtained models are compared for their generalization performance and approximation capability, and although they all possess excellent approximation capabilities, the neural model based on incremental extreme learning machine has shown the best simulation results.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3474-1; POD:978-1-5090-3475-8","10.1109/IECON.2016.7793113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7793113","extended relevance vector machine;extreme learning machine;fuzzy model;neuro-fuzzy model;random nodes","Atmospheric modeling;Data models;Parameter estimation;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Wind energy;Wind speed","feedforward neural nets;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);wind power","Sugeno-Yasukawa identification algorithm;Takagi-Sugeno type;ambient temperature;atmospheric pressure;extreme learning machine techniques;feedforward neural networks;fuzzy inference system;fuzzy logic;meteorological data;neural network techniques;neuro-fuzzy model;relative humidity;relevance vector machine;solar radiation;statistical learning theory;wind speed prediction model","","","","","","","23-26 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, much to our surprise, the reduced model was found to have good classification accuracy for several commonly used data sets from the Web. In this paper, we extend the single output model to a multiple outputs model to handle multiple class problems. The method is particularly suitable for problems with small number of features and large number of examples. The basic component of this polynomial model boils down to construction of new pattern features which are sums of the original features and combination of these new and original features using power and product terms. A linear regularized least-squares predictor is then built using these constructed features. The number of constructed feature terms varies linearly with the order of the polynomial, instead of having a power law in the case of full multivariate polynomials. The method is simple as it amounts to only a few lines of Matlab code. We perform extensive experiments on this reduced model using 42 data sets. Our results compared remarkably well with best reported results of several commonly used algorithms from the literature.

Feature identification and selection has two approaches. The common approach is engineering handcraft which is based on user experience and application area. While the other approach is feature learning that based on making the system identify and select the best features suit the application. The idea behind feature learning is to avoid dealing with any feature extraction or reduction algorithms and to train the suggested model. In this paper, principal component analysis (PCA) will be implemented as a feature learning technique to learn the model extract the features from the input data. Deep learning approach will be proposed by implementing PCA to learn features. In the proposed model, the raw data will be read then represented by using different signal representation as Spectrogram, Wavelet and Wavelet Packet. The new represented data will be fed to principal component analysis layer to generate features and finally, the performance of the suggested scheme will be evaluated by applying different classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Extreme Learning Machine and Discriminate Analysis classification. As an improving step for the results, classifier fusion layer will be implemented to select the most accurate result for both training and testing set. Classifier fusion layer resulted in a promising training and testing accuracies. On the other side, Feature Selection is the procedure of picking out or choosing subgroup of features from a pool of features. Indices may be a good indicator or guider in determining which features to be combined with each other in order to avoid redundancy.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2987-7; POD:978-1-5090-2988-4","10.1109/CIBEC.2016.7836122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836122","Discriminate Analysis;bio-signal processing;classifier fusion;deep learning;extreme learning machine;feature learning;indices;principal component analysis;support vector machine;unlabeled data;unsupervised learning","Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Spectrogram;Support vector machines;Testing;Training;Wavelet packets","electromyography;feature extraction;feature selection;medical signal processing;principal component analysis;signal classification;signal representation;support vector machines;unsupervised learning;wavelet transforms","EMG;PCA;PCA indexing based feature learning;application area;classifier fusion layer;deep learning approach;discriminate analysis classification;engineering handcraft;extreme learning machine;feature extraction;feature identification;feature learning technique;feature selection;input data;principal component analysis;reduction algorithms;signal processing;signal representation;spectrogram;support vector machine;user experience;wavelet packet","","","","","","","15-17 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the exact dependency relation between generalization and uncertainty of a classifier is quite complicated, it is difficult to clearly or explicitly express this relation in general. This paper shows a specific study on this relation from the viewpoint of complexity of classification by choosing extreme learning machines as the classification algorithms. It concludes that the generalization ability of a classifier is statistically becoming better with the increase of uncertainty when the complexity of the classification problem is relatively high, and the generalization ability is statistically becoming worse with the increase of uncertainty when the complexity is relatively low.

KASER is a creative expert system. It is capable of deductive, inductive, and mixed derivations. Its qualitative creativity is realized by using a tree-search mechanism. The system achieves creative reasoning by using a declarative representation of knowledge consisting of object trees and inheritance. KASER computes with words and phrases. It possesses a capability for metaphor-based explanations. This capability is useful in explaining its creative suggestions and serves to augment the capabilities provided by the explanation subsystems of conventional expert systems. KASER also exhibits an accelerated capability to learn. However, this capability depends on the particulars of the selected application domain. For example, application domains such as the game of chess exhibit a high degree of geometric symmetry. Conversely, application domains such as the game of craps played with two dice exhibit no predictable pattern, unless the dice are loaded. More generally, we say that domains whose informative content can be compressed to a significant degree without loss (or with relatively little loss) are symmetric. Incompressible domains are said to be asymmetric or random. The measure of symmetry plus the measure of randomness must always sum to unity.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2004.835081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356021","Expert systems;knowledge amplification;machine learning;object-oriented design;randomization","Acceleration;Computer errors;Computer science;Electronic mail;Expert systems;Helium;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Production;Radar","expert systems;knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);object-oriented methods;tree searching","creative reasoning;expert system;knowledge amplification;knowledge representation;machine learning;object-oriented design;structured expert randomization;tree-search mechanism","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Expert Systems;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Statistical;Random Allocation;Software;User-Computer Interface","24","15","30","","","Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many design metrics have proposed in literature to measure various constructs of Object Oriented (OO) paradigm such as class, coupling, cohesion, inheritance, information hiding and polymorphism and use them further in determining the various aspects of software quality. However, the use of conventional static metrics have found to be inadequate for modern OO software due to the presence of run time polymorphism, templates class, template methods, dynamic binding and some code left unexecuted due to specific input conditions. This gap gave a cue to focus on the use of dynamic metrics instead of traditional static metrics to capture the software characteristics and further deploy them for maintainability predictions. As the dynamic metrics are more precise in capturing the execution behavior of the software system, in the current empirical investigation with the use of open source code, we validate and verify the superiority of dynamic metrics over static metrics. Four machine learning models are used for making the prediction model while training is performed simultaneously using static as well as dynamic metric suite. The results are analyzed using prevalent prediction accuracy measures which indicate that predictive capability of dynamic metrics is more concise than static metrics irrespective of any machine learning prediction model. Results of this would be helpful to practitioners as they can use the dynamic metrics in maintainability prediction in order to achieve precise planning of resource allocation.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7231-2; POD:978-1-4673-7232-9","10.1109/ICRITO.2015.7359354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359354","Dynamic metrics;Machine learning;Software maintainability prediction;Software quality;Static metrics","","learning (artificial intelligence);object-oriented methods;public domain software;resource allocation;software maintenance;software metrics;software quality","OO software;design metrics;dynamic binding;dynamic metrics;machine learning prediction model;maintainability prediction;object oriented paradigm;open source code;prevalent prediction accuracy;resource allocation;run time polymorphism;software characteristics;software metrics;software product estimation;software quality;static metrics;template class;template methods","","","","24","","","2-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed system automatically synthesizes simple problem-specific feature extractors from a training set of face and nonface patterns, without making any assumptions or using any hand-made design concerning the features to extract or the areas of the face pattern to analyze. The face detection procedure acts like a pipeline of simple convolution and subsampling modules that treat the raw input image as a whole. We therefore show that an efficient face detection system does not require any costly local preprocessing before classification of image areas. The proposed scheme provides very high detection rate with a particularly low level of false positives, demonstrated on difficult test sets, without requiring the use of multiple networks for handling difficult cases.

First, an ellipsoid geometry threshold model in Hue Saturation Lightness color space is built to extract interesting color regions. These regions are further screened with a postprocessing step to obtain candidate regions that satisfy both color and brightness conditions. Second, a new kernel function is proposed to effectively combine two heterogeneous features, histograms of oriented gradients and local binary pattern, which is used to describe the candidate regions of traffic light. A kernel extreme learning machine (K-ELM) is designed to validate these candidate regions and simultaneously recognize the phase and type of traffic lights. Furthermore, a spatial-temporal analysis framework based on a finite-state machine is introduced to enhance the reliability of the recognition of the phase and type of traffic light. Finally, a prototype of the proposed system is implemented on a Samsung Note 3 smartphone. To achieve a real-time computational performance of the proposed K-ELM, a CPU-GPU fusion-based approach is adopted to accelerate the execution.

To augment the required precision and dexterity into normal microsurgical work-flow, handheld robotic instruments are developed to compensate physiological tremor in real time. The hardware (sensors and actuators) and software (causal linear filters) employed for tremor identification and filtering introduces time-varying unknown phase delay that adversely affects the device performance. The current techniques that focus on three-dimensions (3-D) tip position control involves modeling and canceling the tremor in three axes (x-, y-, and z -axes) separately. Our analysis with the tremor recorded from surgeons and novice subjects shows that there exists significant correlation in tremor across the dimensions. Based on this, a new multidimensional modeling approach based on extreme learning machines is proposed in this paper to correct the phase delay and to accurately model 3-D tremor simultaneously.

In this paper, a prediction method based on extreme learning machine, support vector machine and particle swarm optimization (PSO-KELM) is introduced to fulfill deck-motion. In this method, the fundamental structure of extreme learning machine is used but the hidden function is substituted the kernel function from support vector machine. Further, aiming to select optimal parameters including penalty coefficient and kernel parameter, auto-adaptive particle swarm optimization is adopted.

The exploration of new paths is probabilistic. Each node sends the same interest through the best interface and through another interface chosen at random simultaneously. The goal is to retrieve the content by using the best path found until present moment and at the same time explore copies that are recently stored in the cache of nearest nodes.

Combining other classification methods, which learn intermediate concepts, with decision tree inducers can produce more flexible decision boundaries that separate different classes, potentially improving classification accuracy. We propose a generic algorithm for cascade generalization of decision tree inducers with the maximum cascading depth as a parameter to constrain the degree of cascading. Cascading methods proposed in the past, i.e., loose coupling and tight coupling, are strictly special cases of this new algorithm. We have empirically evaluated the proposed algorithm using logistic regression and C4.5 as base inducers on 32 UCI data sets and found that neither loose coupling nor tight coupling is always the best cascading strategy and that the maximum cascading depth in the proposed algorithm can be tuned for better classification accuracy. We have also empirically compared the proposed algorithm and ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting and found that the proposed algorithm performs marginally better than bagging and boosting on the average.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294893","65;Machine learning;cascade generalization.;classification;data mining;decision tree","Bagging;Boosting;Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Decision trees;Logic testing;Logistics;Machine learning algorithms;Predictive models;Sequential analysis","data mining;decision trees;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis","classification methods;constrained cascade generalization;data mining;decision trees;flexible decision boundaries;logistic regression;machine learning","","15","","30","","","June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm is efficacious with a remarkable accuracy despite circumventing the vital job of pre-processing and feature extraction from signals that have been acquired from sensors.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1025-7; POD:978-1-5090-1026-4","10.1109/CCIP.2016.7802880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7802880","Human activity recognition;extreme learning machines;sequential learning","Activity recognition;Classification algorithms;Context;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Neural networks","behavioural sciences computing;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets","artificial neural networks;cognitive environments;extreme learning machines;feature extraction;human activity recognition;human behavioural attributes;sequential ELM;sequential extreme learning algorithm","","","","","","","12-13 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Olfactory target/background odor detection via self-expression model","Pingling Deng; L.

In this paper, we propose a self-expression ELM (SeELM) for olfactory target/background detection. Specially, it is known that metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor in electronic nose (E-nose) can response to several target gases and interferences (background) simultaneously, which would seriously deteriorate the detection accuracy of target gases. Considering that there are numerous interferences in real-world application scenario, it is impossible for us to collect them. With a prior knowledge that the target gases samples can be easily collected, a novel SeELM method is proposed to address this issue. The idea is represented as two aspects. First, the target gases being detected by an E-nose can be fixed as invariant information, which is utilized to construct a self-expression model. Second, with the self-expression detector, the unknown backgrounds can be easily recognized in terms of the violation. Experimental results proved that the proposed SeELM method is significantly effective for Target/Background detection in E-nose.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4240-1; POD:978-1-5090-4241-8","10.1109/SSCI.2016.7850052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7850052","Extreme learning machine;background detection;electronic nose;self-expression","Electronic noses;Encoding;Gas detectors;Gases;Interference;Training;Training data","MIS devices;computerised instrumentation;electronic noses;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence)","E-nose;MOS sensor;SeELM method;background interferences;background recognition;electronic nose;extreme learning machine;gas detection accuracy;invariant information;metal oxide semiconductor sensor;olfactory target-background odor detection;self-expression ELM;self-expression detector;single hidden layer feedforward neural network learning method","","","","","","","6-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The DBM has been proposed by us for inducing compact and high performance learning models that are suitable for implementation in P/WCD. The basic idea of the DBM is to generate data to fit the decision boundary (DB) of a high performance model, and then induce a compact model based on the generated data. In our study, support vector machine (SVM) is used as the high performance model, and a single hidden layer MLP is used as the compact model for the DBM algorithm. ELM is paid attention as new learning method for neural networks in recent years. It is known that hidden layer is not to be tuned and available fast training compared to traditional gradient-based learning methods. Experimental results show that the performance of DBM is the highest in three training methods when the number of hidden neurons is small for all databases used in the experiment. This means that the accuracy of DBM converged to high score, when the number of hidden neuron is small. Therefore, we found that DBM is the best algorithm for developing compact and high performance A-agents.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1897-0; POD:978-1-5090-1898-7; USB:978-1-5090-1819-2","10.1109/SMC.2016.7844419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7844419","Aware Agents;Decision Boundary Making;Extreme Learning Machine;Neural Network","Biological neural networks;Data models;Databases;Learning systems;Neurons;Support vector machines;Training","backpropagation;gradient methods;multilayer perceptrons;support vector machines","BP;DBM algorithm;ELM;P/WCD;SVM;aware agents;back propagation;compact MLP;compact model;decision boundary making;extreme learning machine;gradient-based learning methods;hidden neurons;high performance A-agents;high performance learning models;multilayer perceptrons;neural networks;portable/wearable computing devices;single hidden layer MLP;support vector machine","","","","","","","9-12 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, over time, a few good services in service systems have become deprecated, i.e., the service is initially available and is invoked by service users, but later becomes unavailable. Therefore, the prediction of service deprecation has become a key issue in creating reliable long-term user applications. Most existing research has overlooked service deprecation in service systems and has failed to consider long-term service reliability when making service recommendations. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting service deprecation, which comprises two components: Service Comprehensive Feature Modeling (SCFM) for extracting service features relevant to service deprecation and Deprecated Service Prediction (DSP) for building a service deprecation prediction model. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our method yields an improved Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) value over existing methods and thus has better accuracy in service deprecation prediction.","","","10.1109/TST.2017.7830895","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7830895","Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);extreme learning machine;service deprecation predict;web service","Digital signal processing;Feature extraction;Frequency modulation;Mashups;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Reliability","Web services;feature extraction","DSP;SCFM;Web services;improved AUC value;improved area-under-the-curve value;long-term service reliability;long-term user applications;service comprehensive feature modeling;service deprecation prediction model;service feature extraction;service recommendations;service systems;user applications","","","","","","","February 2017","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

He and his colleagues developed the first practical method for training neural networks, but there was just one problem. ""We could never make it work properly,"" Hinton says. At least, not the way they wanted to. Obstacles such as the lack of computing power stood in their way, and controversy erupted when studies in neuroscience suggested that the human brain probably didn't function like their model network. Flash ahead to 2006, and computing power is no longer a problem. Neuroscience has discovered much about how the brain works, but much of how we see is still a mystery. Hinton, a computer scientist at the University of Toronto and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, has discovered some creative strategies to help neural networks fulfil their potential in pattern recognition and artificial intelligence, which he reported in a recent issue of Science (vol. 313, no. 5786, 2006, pp. 504-507).

The R and G channels of the color image are used to form graylevel images. The size of the resulting gray image is reduced and the Sobel operator with a very low threshold is used to get a grayscale edge image. In the adaptive randomized Hough transform, pixels of the gray-edge image are sampled randomly according to their weights corresponding to their gradient magnitudes. The three-dimensional (3-D) parametric space of the curve is reduced to the two-dimensional (2-D) and the one-dimensional (1-D) space. The paired parameters in two dimensions are estimated by gradient directions and the last parameter in one dimension is used to verify the estimated parameters by histogram.

Different risk measures have been proposed to cope with this source of uncertainty. However, those are usually before-the-fact performance indices and cannot give a measure for the financial loss/gain (FLG) of a GenCo considering the electricity prices actually realized in the market. This paper focuses on this matter. The time series of FLG is first constructed given the real conditions of the electricity market. Then, the FLG time series is quantized using Silhouette Criterion and k-means clustering approach. Subsequently, based on the historical values of the quantized FLG time series and relevant exogenous variables, its day-ahead values are predicted. The method proposed for day-ahead FLG prediction consist of conditional mutual information (CMI) and sequential forward search (SFS) as the feature selection technique and extreme learning machine (ELM) as the forecasting engine. The effectiveness of the whole proposed approach, including the FLG time series construction, quantization approach and the prediction method, is shown for a typical GenCo using the real data of the PJM and Ontario electricity markets.","0885-8950;08858950","","10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2654363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822910","Electricity Price Forecast;Financial Loss/Gain (FLG);Generation Company (GenCo);extreme learning machine;feature selection;quantization","Economics;Electric variables measurement;Electricity supply industry;Indexes;Loss measurement;Mutual information;Time series analysis","","","","","","","","20170118","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
