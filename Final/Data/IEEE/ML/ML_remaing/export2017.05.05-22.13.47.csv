Researchers have rigorously studied the resampling, algorithms, and feature selection approaches to this problem. No systematic studies have been conducted to understand how well these methods combat the class imbalance problem and which of these methods best manage the different challenges posed by imbalanced data sets. In particular, feature selection has rarely been studied outside of text classification problems. Additionally, no studies have looked at the additional problem of learning from small samples. This paper presents a first systematic comparison of the three types of methods developed for imbalanced data classification problems and of seven feature selection metrics evaluated on small sample data sets from different applications. We evaluated the performance of these metrics using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (PRC). We compared each metric on the average performance across all problems and on the likelihood of a metric yielding the best performance on a specific problem. We examined the performance of these metrics inside each problem domain. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of these metrics to see which perform best across algorithms. Our results showed that signal-to-noise correlation coefficient (S2N) and Feature Assessment by Sliding Thresholds (FAST) are great candidates for feature selection in most applications, especially when selecting very small numbers of features.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.187","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276797","Class imbalance problem;bioinformatics;feature evaluation and selection;machine learning;pattern recognition;text mining.","Accuracy;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partial response channels;Pattern recognition;Performance evaluation;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Text categorization;Training data","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sampling methods;sensitivity analysis;text analysis","classifier suboptimal performance;feature assessment by sliding thresholds;feature selection metrics;imbalanced data classification;machine learning;metric performance evaluation;precision recall curve;receiver operating characteristic;signal to noise correlation coefficient;small sample class imbalance problem;text classification","","95","","59","","20091002","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many domains, it's not the lack of data that complicates this task. Instead, the challenge is that relevant information is oftentimes obscured by the shear volume of available data, data that in some cases is incomplete or incorrect. For such domains, it may be difficult to quickly identify and adjudicate relevant information from the volume of available data. Helping analysts sift through the noise to find relevant data and to then help them interpret the implications of these data is one of the goals of the research described in this paper. In this paper, we describe two complimentary modeling approaches aimed at supporting situation awareness. Specifically, normalcy models are used to automatically identify anomalous situations that may merit analyst investigation (for example, detection of unusual airline flight patterns). Suitable for domains with uncertain data, the second modeling approach involves the discovery and use of fuzzy event-based models supporting predictive course-of-action (COA) identification and assessment. Using these models, observation data is automatically fused against COA models, allowing analysts to quickly identify and interpret unfolding complex activities. This paper presents an overview of these two types of models and briefly describes how machine learning technology is used to support rapid development and adaptation of these models.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6622-1; POD:978-1-4244-6619-1","10.1109/CTS.2010.5478461","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478461","Normalcy model;complex event processing;fuzzy logic;machine learning;situation awareness","Data analysis;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Pattern analysis;Predictive models;Software maintenance;Springs;Statistical analysis;Traffic control;Training data","fuzzy logic;learning (artificial intelligence);ubiquitous computing","complimentary modeling approach;fuzzy event based model;heterogeneous model;machine learning technology;normalcy model;predictive course-of-action;situation awareness","","0","4","23","","","17-21 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conversely, by knowing the current location and its attribute about possibly taken actions, the action recognition process can be improved with the contextual information since prior knowledge about occurrence of actions is given as the attribute in the map. Additionally, when the posture (such as sitting, standing and getting to one knee) of the pedestrians is known, falsely recognized actions can be rejected. Experimental results show that accuracy of the action recognition on six types of the action (forward walking, backward walking, side stepping, sitting down on/standing up from a chair, going downstairs/upstairs and bending over) is more than 95% by cross validation test on the training data set, and the results also show that error rate of the PDR localization is reduced from 4% of the walking distance to 2% in the total scenario within the office environment by using the results of action recognition to adjust the estimated location.","2153-358X;2153358X","Electronic:978-1-4244-5037-4; POD:978-1-4244-5036-7","10.1109/PLANS.2010.5507239","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507239","AdaBoost;Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR);action recognition;machine learning","Accelerometers;Costs;Dead reckoning;Humans;Knee;Legged locomotion;Machine learning;Measurement units;Productivity;Testing","","","","16","1","8","","","4-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the low-level processing, each cell of K×K pixels is characterized by an adaptive color histogram which optimizes the information representation for WCE images. A Neural Network (NN) cell-classifier is trained to classify cells in an image as bleeding or non-bleeding patches. In the intermediate-level processing, a block which covers 3×3 cells is formed. The intermediate-level representation of the block is generated from the low-level classifications of the cells, which captures the spatial local correlations of the cell classifications. Again, a NN block-classifier is trained to classify the blocks as bleeding or non-bleeding ones. In the high-level processing, the low-level cell-based and intermediate-level block-based classifications are fused for final detection. In this way, our approach can combine the low-level features from pixels and intermediate-level features from local regions to achieve robust bleeding detection. Experiments on real WCE videos have shown that the proposed method of multi-level classification is not only accurate in both detection and localization of potential bleedings in WCE images but also robust to complex local noisy features.","2326-8123;23268123","Electronic:978-1-4244-6502-6; POD:978-1-4244-6499-9","10.1109/ICCIS.2010.5518576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5518576","Neural Network (NN) and machine-learning;Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE);adaptive color histogram;bleeding detection;block classification;feature extraction","Biomedical imaging;Color;Computer vision;Endoscopes;Hemorrhaging;Histograms;Neural networks;Paper technology;Robustness;Videos","endoscopes;feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image representation;image resolution;medical image processing;object detection","bleeding detection;complex local noisy features;intermediate-level representation;low-level processing;multilevel local feature classification;neural network cell-classifier;spatial local correlations;wireless capsule endoscopy images","","10","1","15","","","28-30 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This implies that solving the first problem requires an exhaustive search over the feature subsets of size k. The second problem consists of finding the minimal feature subset that has minimal Bayes risk.

The exact position and orientation are defined as “reaching pose” in this paper. Two issues are mainly concerned and this leads to two contributions in this paper: (1) Find the relationship between reaching pose and object pose in the image. Unlike traditional methods based on complex calibration, supervised learning algorithm is introduced to learn the relationship based on training data which are collected automatically. This method has two main advantages: 1) it can be implemented with little human assistance and 2) it can handle non-linear case. (2) Represent the object pose in the image. A novel and robust algorithm is proposed to extract the feature points. The feature points are robust and invariant under translation, rotation and scaling. Then those feature points are sorted into a sequence which corresponds to the input-variable vector. The sequence is also robust to make sure the consistency of the meanings of the input variables. Finally, the experiments show the validity of our method.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7656-5; POD:978-1-4244-7653-4","10.1109/ICINDMA.2010.5538251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5538251","Robot vision;object reaching;object representation;robot grasping;supervised machine learning","Calibration;Control systems;Data mining;Feature extraction;Humans;Input variables;Robots;Robustness;Supervised learning;Training data","","","","0","","15","","","30-31 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One feature of this problem is that expert-defined hierarchies of protein classes exist and can potentially be exploited to improve classification performance. In this article, we investigate empirically whether this is the case for two such hierarchies. We compare multiclass classification techniques that exploit the information in those class hierarchies and those that do not, using logistic regression, decision trees, bagged decision trees, and support vector machines as the underlying base learners. In particular, we compare hierarchical and flat variants of ensembles of nested dichotomies. The latter have been shown to deliver strong classification performance in multiclass settings. We present experimental results for synthetic, fold recognition, enzyme classification, and remote homology detection data. Our results show that exploiting the class hierarchy improves performance on the synthetic data but not in the case of the protein classification problems. Based on this, we recommend that strong flat multiclass methods be used as a baseline to establish the benefit of exploiting class hierarchies in this area.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2008.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641909","Biology and genetics;Classifier design and evaluation;Data mining;Machine learning;Protein classification;Sciences;hierarchical classification;multiclass classification.","","biological techniques;biology computing;enzymes;molecular biophysics;support vector machines","enzyme classification;fold recognition;homology detection data;multiclass settings;nested dichotomy;protein flat classification;protein hierarchical classification;support vector machines","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computing Methodologies;Molecular Sequence Data;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Protein Folding;Proteins","11","","44","","20081010","July-Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The annihilators attempt to identify pre-specified patterns via removal of inter-symbol correlations from observed sequences, thereby turning them into symbolic white noise. Thus a perfect annihilation corresponds to a pattern match. This approach of classification via information annihilation is shown to be strictly advantageous, with theoretical guarantees, for a large class of PFSA models.

All these subsystems are developed based on the machine learning techniques including support vector machines (SVMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) together with carefully designed informative features. At the same time, BioLMiner makes use of some biological specific resources and existing natural language processing tools. In order to evaluate and compare BioLMiner, it is adapted to participate in two tasks of the BioCreative II.5 challenge: interaction normalization task (INT) using GNer and interaction pair task (IPT) using PPIEor.

However, in real applications, these two hypotheses are difficult to hold, traditional algorithms are hence no longer applicable. As a new framework of learning, transfer learning could solve this problem effectively. This paper focuses on one of important branches in this field, namely inductive transfer learning. Correspondingly, a weighted algorithm of inductive transfer learning, based on maximum entropy model, is proposed, called WTLME. It transfers the model parameters learned from the source domain to the target domain, and meanwhile adjusts the weights of instances in the target domain to obtain the model with high accuracy. Extensive studies demonstrate that our proposed algorithm of WTLME is more effective and efficient than traditional algorithms that require learning from scratch if the data distributions change. Moreover, WTLME is comparable to the previous transfer algorithm based on maximum entropy model.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5934-6; POD:978-1-4244-5931-5","10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569513","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5569513","data mining;machine learning;maximum entropy;transfer learning","Adaptation model;Classification algorithms;Data models;Entropy;Error analysis;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum entropy methods","WTLME;data mining algorithms;inductive transfer learning;machine learning algorithms;maximum entropy model;source domain;target domain;weighted algorithm","","0","","13","","","10-12 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been shown that 80% of type 2 diabetes complications can be prevented or delayed by early identification of people at risk. In this context, several data mining and machine learning methods have been used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of diabetes. In this paper, we propose utilizing support vector machines (SVMs) for the diagnosis of diabetes. In particular, we use an additional explanation module, which turns the “black box” model of an SVM into an intelligible representation of the SVM's diagnostic (classification) decision. Results on a real-life diabetes dataset show that intelligible SVMs provide a promising tool for the prediction of diabetes, where a comprehensible ruleset have been generated, with prediction accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 93%, and specificity of 94%.

However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5288526","Transfer learning;data mining.;machine learning;survey","Data mining;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge transfer;Labeling;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Space technology;Testing;Training data","knowledge engineering;learning by example;optimisation;unsupervised learning","data mining;inductive transfer learning;knowledge transfer;machine learning;transductive transfer learning;unsupervised transfer learning","","995","3","88","","20091016","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, in the real-world application, the large-scale training email dataset which differs from the assumption made in experiment challenges both efficiency and effectiveness. Thus, a new promising method to filter emails is in need. In this paper, we propose an SVM based machine learning method to compress the training set with minimal information loss. The key process is that we reduce large-scale training email set according to the distribution of Support Vectors produced by SVM training. Then a compressed training set is obtained and makes a great contribution to saving time and keeping precision in generating anti-spam models.

Careful recreation of the viewing conditions is necessary, and a strict selection of the test subjects is required based on many criteria. This is why solutions are often found in various objective methodologies for measuring the QoE of multimedia.

In the training process, data along with their identification class labels (say, 1 denotes time division multiple access, and -1 stands for slotted Aloha) are used to train the SVMs. After training, contention or control based MAC protocols can be effectively determined by the trained SVMs embedded in a cognitive radio terminal of a secondary network.","2379-1268;23791268","Electronic:978-1-4244-7596-4; POD:978-1-4244-7597-1","10.1109/WOCC.2010.5510617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510617","MAC protocol classification;Rayleigh fading;capture effect;machine learning","Access protocols;Chromium;Cognitive radio;Information analysis;Machine learning;Media Access Protocol;Monitoring;Power system modeling;Radio control;Time division multiple access","access protocols;cognitive radio;learning (artificial intelligence);radio networks;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","MAC protocol classification;SVM;cognitive radio network;cognitive radio terminal;identification class labels;machine learning based algorithm;media access control protocols;slotted Aloha;support vector machines;time division multiple access;transmission mechanisms","","1","","10","","","14-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While previous approaches allowed online learning with performance improvements during each generation, our approach enables a finer grained online learning with performance improvements within each lap. We tested our approach on three tracks using two methods of online neuroevolution (NEAT and rtNEAT) combined with four evaluation strategies ( -greedy, -greedy-improved, softmax, and interval-based) taken from the literature. We compared the eight resulting configurations on several driving tasks involving the learning of a driving behavior for a specific track, its adaptation to a new track, and the generalization capability to unknown tracks. The results we present show that, notwithstanding the several challenges that online learning poses, our approach 1) can successfully evolve drivers from scratch, 2) can also be used to transfer evolved knowledge to other tracks, and 3) can generalize effectively producing controllers that can drive on difficult unseen tracks. Our results also suggest that the approach performs better when coupled with online NEAT and also indicate that -greedy-improved and softmax are generally better than the other evaluation strategies. A comparison with typical offline neuroevolution suggests that online neuroevolution can be competitive and even outperform traditional offline approaches on more difficult tracks while providing all the interesting features of online learning. Overall, we believe that this study may represent an initial step toward the application of online neuroevolution in games.","1943-068X;1943068X","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2010.2052102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482132","Machine learning;neuroevolution;online learning;online neuroevolution;simulated car racing","Application software;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Humans;Learning systems;Machine learning;Pattern matching;Performance evaluation;Stochastic processes;Testing","Internet;computer games;greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","TORCS;nonplayer characters;online learning;online neuroevolution;the open racing car simulator","","8","","48","","20100607","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In contrast to most of the work on Web usage mining, the usage data that are analyzed here correspond to user navigation throughout the Web, rather than a particular Web site, exhibiting as a result a high degree of thematic diversity. For modeling the user communities, we introduce a novel methodology that combines the users' browsing behavior with thematic information from the Web directories. Following this methodology, we enhance the clustering and probabilistic approaches presented in previous work and also present a new algorithm that combines these two approaches. The resulting community models take the form of Community Web Directories.

The Algorithm uses a row-based storage method to reduce memory requirement and finally can parallelize both data loading and computation. Let l denote the number of training instances, d the dimension of each instance, m the number of machines. We divide the data to m parts, and loads only essential data to each machine to perform parallel computation. The memory requirement can be reduced from O(ld) to O(ld/m).

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our evaluation of the distributed algorithm using QSSVM reveals that it detects anomalies with comparable accuracy and less communication overhead than a centralized approach.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2051543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483231","Anomaly detection;distributed computing;information security;machine learning;outlier detection;security;support vector machines (SVMs);wireless sensor networks","Computer networks;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms;Fault diagnosis;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Permission;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;hyperellipsoidal support vector machines;hyperspherical support vector machines;intrusion detection;linear programming;one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine;wireless sensor networks","","57","","52","","20100610","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The regression tree is built by iteratively splitting dataset and selecting attributes into a hierarchical tree model. The sample size reduces sharply after few levels of data splitting causing unreliable attribute selection. In contrast, the forward stepwise regression analysis selects critical attributes all the way with the same set of data. Regression analysis is, however, not capable of splitting data into groups with different underlying models. In this research, we propose a sample-efficient regression tree (SERT) approach that combines the forward selection in regression analysis and regression tree methodologies. The proposed approach is shown to be able to fully utilize the dataset's degree of freedom and build piecewise linear model to capture the attribute effects.

Based on findings describing the communicative functions served by these nonverbal behaviors, many virtual agent systems have modeled them to make the virtual agent look more effective and believable. One channel of nonverbal behaviors that has received less attention is head movements, despite the important functions served by them. The goal for this work is to build a domain-independent model of speaker's head movements that could be used to generate head movements for virtual agents. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach for learning models of head movements by focusing on when speaker head nods should occur, and conduct evaluation studies that compare the nods generated by this work to our previous approach of using handcrafted rules . To learn patterns of speaker head nods, we use a gesture corpus and rely on the linguistic and affective features of the utterance. We describe the feature selection process and training process for learning hidden Markov models and compare the results of the learned models under varying conditions. The results show that we can predict speaker head nods with high precision (.84) and recall (.89) rates, even without a deep representation of the surface text and that using affective information can help improve the prediction of the head nods (precision: .89, recall: .90).

Despite their popularity, HMMs make inaccurate assumptions about speech signals, thereby limiting the achievable performance of the conventional speech recognizer. Penalized logistic regression (PLR) is a well-founded discriminative classifier with long roots in the history of statistics. Its classification performance is often compared with that of the popular support vector machine (SVM). However, for speech classification, only limited success with PLR has been reported, partially due to the difficulty with sequential data. In this paper, we present an elegant way of incorporating HMMs in the PLR framework. This leads to a powerful discriminative classifier that naturally handles sequential data. In this approach, speech classification is done using affine combinations of HMM log-likelihoods. We believe that such combinations of HMMs lead to a more accurate classifier than the conventional HMM-based classifier. Unlike similar approaches, we jointly estimate the HMM parameters and the PLR parameters using a single training criterion. The extension to continuous speech recognition is done via rescoring of N-best lists or lattices.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2035151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5299048","Automatic speech recognition (ASR);N-best and lattice rescoring;hidden Markov model (HMM);logistic regression;machine learning","","hidden Markov models;regression analysis;speech recognition","HMM log-likelihood regressors;HMM-based classifier;N-best rescoring;PLR;SVM;affine combinations;automatic speech recognition;hidden Markov models;penalized logistic regression;sequential data;speech classification;support vector machine;well-founded discriminative classifier","","8","","42","","20091030","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence, the presented system supports users by offering an intuitive preference formulation which is known from daily life: the spontaneous quality judgement between objects without deeper knowledge of underlying attributes. This facilitates the interaction with the presented system as no new cognitive burdens are introduced into the search process.

Researchers have been pouring over blog data with the goal of finding communities, tracking what people are saying, finding influencers, and using many social network analytic tools to analyze the underlying social networks embedded within the blogosphere. One of the key technical problems with analyzing large social networks such as those embedded in the blogosphere is that there are many links between individuals and we often do not know the context or meaning of those links. This is problematic because it makes it difficult if not impossible to tease out the true communities, their behavior, how information flows, and who the central players are (if any). This paper seeks to further our understanding of how to analyze large blog networks and what they can tell us. We analyze 1.24M blogs posted by 298K bloggers over a period of three weeks. These bloggers span private blog sites through large blog-sites such as live journal and blogspot. We first characterize the behavior of bloggers, validating some (but not all) common beliefs about how often bloggers post, how long their posts are, who they link to and how much reciprocity there is in links. We then take a look at bloggers from the larger blog sites to understand whether and how they differ in terms of these metrics. Finally, we extend our analysis to focus on contextual links: what is the textual content of the blog which had a link. We identify topics from the textual content of all the blog posts and use these to tag links based on the topics that were discussed in the blog.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4138-9; POD:978-1-4244-7787-6","10.1109/ASONAM.2010.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562787","community detection;machine learning;social network analysis;text mining;topic detection","Communities;Context;Information services;Internet;MySpace","data analysis;social networking (online)","bloggers;blogosphere;contextual information;linking behaviors;posting behaviors;social network analytic tools","","1","","13","","","9-11 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We develop a method using a metric to quantitatively analyze the unpredictability of a defect dataset and carry out case studies on two defect datasets.

Given the intricate designs and workloads of multi or many-core processors, it is computationally exhaustive to develop models that accurately calculate the temperature and performance of a given processor under various operating conditions. To abstract the underlying design complexity, we propose the use of supervised machine learning techniques to develop versatile models that capture the thermal characterization of multi-core processors under various input conditions and workloads. We then use the developed models to create a framework where various design constraints and objectives are expressed and solved using combinatorial optimization techniques.

The accuracy of traffic identification methods has also become more important due to the greater use of delay sensitive applications such as VoIP and video over IP which need to be identified and given priority. Traditional techniques such as header and payload inspection are not providing sufficient information to identify traffic types due to the usage of non-standard ports, tunnelling and encryption. Promising methods have been proposed based around the statistical behaviour of traffic flow. Although these methods can achieve quite high accuracies in non-encrypted traffic flows, traffic identification of encrypted traffic flows is still in its early stages. In this paper, we will review the recent work done on encrypted traffic identification, particularly network layer encryption using statistical techniques and propose a remarkably simple technique for VoIP traffic identification in IPSec peer to peer tunnels. More importantly it is shown that VoIP/non-VoIP classification can be used to dramatically improve VoIP QoS and may be used to effectively block non-VoIP traffic in an IPSec tunnel. These results point to the usefulness of the technique and the desirability to find more discriminating VoIP identification algorithms for IPSec tunnels.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7681-7; POD:978-1-4244-7679-4","10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559900","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559900","IPSec;Machine Learning;Tunnelled Traffic;VoIP","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Cryptography;Quality of service;Servers","IP networks;cryptography;peer-to-peer computing;quality of service;video signal processing","IPSec tunnel;VoIP QoS;VoIP identification algorithm;VoIP traffic classification;delay sensitive application;encrypted traffic identification;network layer encryption;non-encrypted traffic flow;payload inspection;statistical behaviour;video over IP","","8","","17","","","1-3 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The behavior of an agglomerative hierarchical clustering system is studied to determine which initialization parameters impact accuracy most. We show that the accuracy of typical systems is indeed very sensitive to the values chosen for the initialization parameters and factors such as the duration of speech in the recording. We then present a solution that reduces the sensitivity of the initialization values and therefore reduces the need for manual tuning significantly while at the same time increasing the accuracy of the system. For short meetings extracted from the previous (2006, 2007, and 2009) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Rich Transcription (RT) evaluation data, the decrease of the diarization error rate is up to 50% relative. The approach consists of a novel initialization parameter estimation method for speaker diarization that uses agglomerative clustering with Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of frame-based cepstral features (MFCCs). The estimation method balances the relationship between the optimal value of the seconds of speech data per Gaussian and the duration of the speech data and is combined with a novel nonuniform initialization method.

The SVDD density estimate can be integrated into a wide range of PFs to realize several benefits. It yields a sparse representation of the posterior density that reduces the computational complexity of the PF. The proposed approach also provides an analytical expression for the posterior distribution that can be used to identify its modes for maintaining multiple hypotheses and computing the MAP estimate, and to directly sample from the posterior.

Chandra","University of Minnesota, Minneapolis","IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","20100628","2010","21","8","1089","1102","Resource discovery is an important process for finding suitable nodes that satisfy application requirements in large loosely coupled distributed systems. Besides internode heterogeneity, many of these systems also show a high degree of intranode dynamism, so that selecting nodes based only on their recently observed resource capacities can lead to poor deployment decisions resulting in application failures or migration overheads. However, most existing resource discovery mechanisms rely mainly on recent observations to achieve scalability in large systems. In this paper, we propose the notion of a resource bundle-a representative resource usage distribution for a group of nodes with similar resource usage patterns-that employs two complementary techniques to overcome the limitations of existing techniques: resource usage histograms to provide statistical guarantees for resource capacities and clustering-based resource aggregation to achieve scalability. Using trace-driven simulations and data analysis of a month-long PlanetLab trace, we show that resource bundles are able to provide high accuracy for statistical resource discovery, while achieving high scalability. We also show that resource bundles are ideally suited for identifying group-level characteristics (e.g., hot spots, total group capacity). To automatically parameterize the bundling algorithm, we present an adaptive algorithm that can detect online fluctuations in resource heterogeneity.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2009.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226621","Resource discovery;aggregation;machine learning.;resource management","","data analysis;resource allocation;statistical analysis","data analysis;internode heterogeneity;intranode dynamism;resource bundle notion;resource bundles;resource discovery mechanisms;resource usage distribution;resource usage patterns;statistical large scale resource discovery;statistical large scale resource management;trace driven simulations","","5","","30","","20090828","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we first designed a distributed host based traffic collecting platform (DHTCP) to gather traffic samples with accurate application information on user hosts.

In this paper, a method to obtain the ultrasound image of a region of interest and the estimation of the related microbubble volumetric concentration is proposed. The mentioned tasks are performed in an unique investigation, working on the signals remotely acquired by means of an ultrasound scanner. The algorithm is divided into two steps. Firstly, a signal processing technique, based on multi-pulse transmission and recombination of the received signals, is used to obtain an image of the scene and to detect the bubble echoes abating surrounding tissue contribution. Then, the residual bubble echo, remained after the application of the technique, is processed in order to estimate the concentration.

However SMO becomes slow for large size training data set. In this paper we present a MapReduce based distributed implementation of SMO using Hadoop. The distributed SMO uses multiple core processors to process the training data. By partitioning the training data set into smaller subsets and allocating each of the partitioned subsets to a single Map task, each Map task optimizes the partition in parallel and finally the reducer combine the results.
