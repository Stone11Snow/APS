In our earlier study, we proposed a decision boundary making (DBM) algorithm. The main philosophy of the DBM algorithm is to reconstruct a high performance model with much smaller cost. In our study, we use support vector machine as a high performance model, and a multilayer neural network, i.e., multilayer perceptron (MLP), as the small model. Experimental results obtained so far show that high performance and compact MLPs can be obtained using DBM. However, there are several parameters of DBM that need to be adjusted appropriately in order to achieve better performance. In this paper, we investigate the effect of parameter N, which is the number of newly generated data, on the performance of obtained MLPs. We discuss the issue that how many new data we should generate to obtain a better performance of DBM. We also investigate the effect of outliers on the performance of the obtained MLPs. Outliers are generally known to be harmful for pattern recognition. Our experimental results show, however, that for some databases, outliers can be useful for obtaining high performance MLPs.","1062-922X;1062922X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3840-7; POD:978-1-4799-3841-4; USB:978-1-4799-3839-1","10.1109/SMC.2014.6973992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973992","Awareness Agents;Decision Boundary Learning;Decision Boundary Making;Neural Network;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Databases;Machine learning algorithms;Neurons;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;support vector machines","DBM algorithm;MLP;decision boundary making algorithm;high performance model;learning parameters;machine learning models;multilayer neural network;multilayer perceptron;pattern recognition;support vector machine","","0","","10","","","5-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using daily time series data, one is able to predict the trend with the help of simple moving average technique. Unfortunately, stock trend is also affected by many factors, one of which is daily news. Daily news, particularly financial news have a great role in deciding stock trend. Each news has a sentiment value classified into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment that directly affects whether the trend goes up or down. It will be useful to combine simple moving average and news classification to predict stock trend more responsively. This paper uses machine learning using artificial neural network to combine the two aspects. The experiment in this paper uses approximately one year's worth of stock data and financial news.

Specifically, our technique maps data into networks and constructs two network adjacency matrices which convey information about intra-class components and inter-class penalty connections. Both matrices are inserted into an optimization framework in order to achieve a projection vector that is used to project high-dimension data samples into a low-dimensional space. One advantage of the technique is that no parameter is required, that is, there is no need to select a model for the input data. Computer simulations on real-world data sets have been performed to compare the proposed technique to some classical network formation methods such as k-NN and e-radius, and to well-known dimensionality reduction algorithms such as PCA and LDA.

This paper studies different classifiers for aspect identification from unlabeled free-form textual customer reviews. Firstly, a multi-aspect classification is proposed to learn implicit and explicit aspect-related context from the reviews for aspect identification, which does not require any manually labeled training data. Secondly, extensive experiments for analyzing the effectiveness of classifiers and feature selection for aspect identification have also been shown.

Existing oversampling approaches for addressing this problem typically do not consider the probability distribution of the minority class while synthetically generating new samples. As a result, the minority class is not represented well which leads to high misclassification error. We introduce two probabilistic oversampling approaches, namely RACOG and wRACOG, to synthetically generating and strategically selecting new minority class samples. The proposed approaches use the joint probability distribution of data attributes and Gibbs sampling to generate new minority class samples.

However, theoretical analysis on the distribution of F<sub>1</sub> values shows that such distribution is actually non-symmetrical. Thus, simply using symmetrical distribution to approximate non-symmetrical distribution may be inappropriate and may result in a low degree of confidence and long interval length for the confidence interval. In the present study, a non-symmetrical confidence interval of the F<sub>1</sub> measure based on Beta prime distribution is constructed by using the F<sub>1</sub> value computed based on the average confusion matrix of a blocked 3 x 2 cross-validation. Experimental results show that in most cases, our method has high degrees of confidence.

Today, every sensor or ADA in its applied system participates in the collection of data throughout the entire system. The data collected from all of the sensors or ADAs are then integrated into one significant conclusion or decision, a process known as data fusion. However, the reliability, or reputation, of a single sensor or ADA may change over time, or may not be known at all. Since this reputation is taken into account when determining the final conclusion post data classification, one must be able to predict their reputations. We propose a new machine learning prediction technique (MLPT) to predict the reputation of each sensor or ADA. This technique is based on the existing 'Decision Tree Certainty Level' technique, or DTCL, which is the creation of many random decision trees (forests) with high certainty levels [Dolev et al. (2009)]. In particular, it was shown that the DTCL enhances the classification capabilities of CARTs (Classification and Regression Trees) [Briman et al. (1984)]. After applying the DTCL technique to the reputation data, we then apply a new evolutionary process on those decision trees to reduce the overall number of trees by merging only the most accurate trees and then using only these new trees to generate the reputation values. Thus, we combine DTCL and evolution techniques to enable the determination of sensor or ADA reputations by using only the most accurate trees. Finally, we demonstrate how to improve the data fusion process by identifying the most reliable portions of the collected data to reach more accurate conclusions.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4432-3; POD:978-1-4799-4431-6","10.1109/SWSTE.2014.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6887537","Anomaly Detection Algorithms;Decision tree;Prediction;Reputation","Accuracy;Data integration;Decision trees;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Sensors;Vegetation","decision trees;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;security of data;sensor fusion","ADA reputations;CART;DTCL technique;MLPT;anomaly detection algorithms;classification and regression trees;cyber security systems;data classification;data fusion process;decision tree certainty level technique;evolution techniques;evolutionary process;machine learning prediction technique;random decision trees;reliable system;reputation prediction;sensor networks","","0","","7","","","11-12 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the presented scenario smart houses play an important role to reduce the stand-by consumption footprint introducing new strategies able to autonomously recognize these energy wastes. In 1999 the International Energy Agency launched the one-watt initiative with the aim of fighting this problem, today's smart homes can contribute to reduce the phenomenon with a 60% saving. Different strategies can be used in order to recognize a stand-by state, they can be divided in supervised and unsupervised approaches.

Many papers in the literature rely on explicit features derived from network, file system, or registry interaction. While effective, use of these fine-granularity data points makes these techniquse computationally expensive. Moreover, the signatures and heuristics this analysis produces are often circumvented by subsequent malware authors. To this end we propose CHATTER, a system that is concerned only with the order in which high-level system events take place. Individual events are mapped onto an alphabet and execution traces are captured via terse concatenations of those letters. Then, leveraging an analyst labeled corpus of malware, n-gram document classification techniques are applied to produce a classifier predicting malware family. This paper describes that technique and its proof-of-concept evaluation. In its prototype form only network events are considered and three malware families are highlighted. We show the technique achieves roughly 80% accuracy in isolation and makes non-trivial performance improvements when integrated with a baseline classifier of non-ordered features (with an accuracy of roughly 95%).","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5890-0; POD:978-1-4799-5891-7","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997496","","Accuracy;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Malware;Support vector machines","document handling;invasive software;pattern classification","Chatter;classifier predicting malware family;file system;fine granularity data points;heuristics;high level system events;malware authors;malware families classification;malware identification;n-gram document classification;network events;proof-of-concept evaluation;registry interaction;runtime execution artifacts;security domain;system event ordering","","2","","53","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an approach that aligns complete sets of attributes of the datasets, allowing for different number of attributes.

The problem of associative classification is used here for evaluating the proposed algorithm. We evaluate CARM over both synthetic and real benchmark data sets obtained from the UC Irvine machine learning repository.

Although there are plenty of techniques to handle this problem, most of them are too simplistic to provide a good estimation for absent attribute values. A very active research area focuses on solving the missing attribute value problem via imputation methods, which replaces missing data with substituted values. This paper proposes a new imputation method which uses a special graph named Complete p-Partite Attribute-based Decision Graphs (CpP-AbDG) to estimate, in a consistent and plausible way, the missing values. The graph is built by considering the range of each attribute that describes the data divided into sub-intervals; sub-intervals are approached as the vertices of a graph. Edges are then established between pairs of different vertices, provided they do not related to the same attribute. The edges and vertices are finally assigned a weight, based on distributions of the classes. The resulting CpP-AbDG has shown to be a suitable and informative data structure for finding the proper interval in which a missing attribute value should lie, taking into account all the attributes that describe the data. Results comparing the proposed approach to classical ones in an computational environment that considers classification problems as an evaluation criteria, show the potential of the method.","2161-4393;21614393","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6627-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-1484-5; POD:978-1-4799-1482-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889593","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Training data","data mining;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","CpP-AbDG;complete p-partite attribute-based decision graphs;data mining;data structure;machine learning;missing attribute values","","0","","14","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenges to solve a large-scale machine learning problem in big data scenario generally lie in three aspects. Firstly, a proposed machine learning algorithm has to be appropriated for the distributed optimization problem. Secondly, it needs a platform for the distributed implementation. Finally, the communication delays different machines may cause problems in convergence even though the non-distributed algorithm shows a good convergence rate. In order to solve these challenges, we propose a new machine learning approach named Distributed Class-dependent Feature Analysis (DCFA), to combine the advantages of sparse representation in an over-complete dictionary. The classifier is based on the estimation of class-specific optimal filters, by solving an l<sub>1</sub>-norm optimization problem. We demonstrate how this problem is solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers and also explore relevant convergency details. More importantly, our proposed framework can be efficiently implemented on a robust distributed framework. Thus, it improves both accuracy and computational time in large-scale databases. Our method achieves very high classification accuracies in face recognition in the presence of occlusions on AR database. It also outperforms the state of the art methods in object recognition on two challenging large-scale object databases, i.e. Caltech101 and Caltech256. It hence shows its applicability to general computer vision and pattern recognition problems. In addition, computational time experiments show our distributed method achieves high speedup of 7.85x on Caltech256 databases with just 10 machine nodes compared to the non-distributed version and can gain even more with more computing resources.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5666-1; POD:978-1-4799-5667-8","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004233","Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers;Big Data;Class-dependence Feature Analysis;Distributed Optimization Problems;Spare Representation","Big data;Databases;Dictionaries;Face;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Virtual machining","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification","AR database;Big Data;Caltech101;Caltech256;DCFA;alternating direction method of multipliers;class-specific optimal filters;classification accuracies;classifier;communication delays;computer vision;convergence rate;distributed class dependent feature analysis;distributed optimization problem;face recognition;l<sub>1</sub>-norm optimization problem;large-scale machine learning problem;large-scale object databases;machine learning algorithm;nondistributed algorithm;object recognition;occlusions;over-complete dictionary;pattern recognition;robust distributed framework;sparse representation","","1","","19","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, some of new objects do not match any decision rule conditions because the given data table does not always include all possible patterns. In those cases, no estimated classes are obtained. Classes of such new objects are estimated by using partially matched decision rules. In this paper, to raise the classification accuracy, we propose to add supplementary rules which can work well for the mismatched new objects in the class estimation.

Our target here is ""Big Data"" processing on commodity clusters (mostly sparse power-law data). Allreduce can be used to synchronize models, to maintain distributed datasets, and to perform operations on distributed data such as sparse matrix multiply. We first review a key constraint on cluster communication, the minimum efficient packet size, which hampers the use of direct all-to-all protocols on large networks. Our allreduce network is a nested, heterogeneous-degree butterfly. We show that communication volume in lower layers is typically much less than the top layer, and total communication across all layers a small constant larger than the top layer, which is close to optimal. A chart of network communication volume across layers has a characteristic ""Kylix"" shape, which gives the method its name. For optimum performance, the butterfly degrees also decrease down the layers. Furthermore, to efficiently route sparse updates to the nodes that need them, the network must be nested. While the approach is amenable to various kinds of sparse data, almost all ""Big Data"" sets show power-law statistics, and from the properties of these, we derive methods for optimal network design. Finally, we present experiments showing with Kylix on Amazon EC2 and demonstrating significant improvements over existing systems such as PowerGraph and Hadoop.","0190-3918;01903918","Electronic:978-1-4799-5618-0; POD:978-1-4799-7858-8","10.1109/ICPP.2014.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957236","","Benchmark testing;Big data;Fault tolerance;Machine learning algorithms;Sparse matrices;Topology;Vectors","Big Data;data mining;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix multiplication;network theory (graphs);parallel processing;sparse matrices;synchronisation;tree data structures","Amazon EC2;Big Data processing;characteristic Kylix shape;cluster communication;commodity clusters;communication volume;direct all-to-all protocols;distributed datasets;distributed graph mining;low-layers;machine learning;minimum efficient packet size;model synchronization;nested-heterogeneous-degree butterfly;network communication volume;optimal network design;optimum performance;parallel computing;power-law statistics;sparse allreduce;sparse matrix multiply;sparse power-law data;sparse updates;top-layer","","1","","33","","","9-12 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then apply Principal Component Analysis and Gaussian Process algorithms on the discriminative grasp metrics to build a classifier that predicts grasp quality. The key findings are as follows: (i) several of the grasp metrics in the literature are weak predictors of grasp quality when implemented on a physical robotic platform; (ii) the Gaussian Process-based classifier significantly improves grasp prediction techniques by providing an absolute grasp quality prediction score from combining multiple grasp metrics.

In addition, the computational speed of ARAS is enhanced by giving importance to the rules that have lower antecedent support.

Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) methods have been developed to tackle this problem by learning an optimal combination of a set of predefined kernels. Distance Metric Learning (DML) approaches have been also attracted the attention of a number of researchers in order to find an optimum metric automatically. In this paper, within the framework of the SVM classifier, we present a MKL method which is based on the concept of the distance metric learning theory.

Modeling cyberattacks has become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated: 1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is examined in detail with the study of lp-norms in radial basis function (RBF) kernels.

In recent years, interests have been geared towards exploring the relationship between gut microbial factors and the subject's degree of, or propensity to, obesity. With the relative abundance values of phylotypes as features, machine learning algorithms could be applied to identify predictive microbes that distinguish between subjects of different types, and infer the corresponding rules that describe “how” the differentiation is made. However, the relative abundance is influenced by a number of upstream factors, and the inherent information content can often times limit the validity of the inferred rules. We addressed this issue by structurally incorporating association measures into interpretable classifiers. The resulting model renders microbial abundance patterns that are both statistically significant and predictively valid. Although we concentrated on obesity in this paper, the proposed approach is applicable on 16S rRNA datasets of other domains as well. The inferred patterns are in line with current knowledge of the microbial world, while providing new insights on the interactions between microbial factors, and their effects on the host. As such, they are believed to constitute credible starting points for further research.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5669-2; POD:978-1-4799-5670-8","10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999176","decision tree;microbiota;random forest;risk ratio","Communities;Decision trees;Machine learning algorithms;Microorganisms;Obesity;Radio frequency;Vegetation","RNA;bioinformatics;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);microorganisms;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;pattern classification","16S rRNA datasets;association measures;disease;gut microbial factors;host obesity;inherent information content;interpretable classifiers;machine learning algorithms;microbial abundance patterns;microbial interaction factors;phylotypes;predictive microbes;structural incorporation;structurally incorporating association measures;upstream factors","","0","","19","","","2-5 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Written self-report anxiety measures are available; however, these indices tend to be time consuming to acquire. For medical patients, completing written reports can be burdensome if they are weak, in pain, or in acute anxiety states. Consequently, simple and fast non-invasive methods for assessing stress response from neurophysiological data are essential. In this paper, we report on a study that makes predictions of the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) index from oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentration changes of the prefrontal cortex using a two-channel portable near-infrared spectroscopy device. Predictions are achieved by constructing machine learning algorithms within a Bayesian framework with nonlinear basis function together with Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation. In this paper, prediction experiments were performed against four different data sets, i.e., two comprising young subjects, and the remaining two comprising elderly subjects. The number of subjects in each data set varied between 17 and 20 and each subject participated only once. They were not asked to perform any task; instead, they were at rest. The root mean square errors for the four groups were 6.20, 6.62, 4.50, and 6.38, respectively. There appeared to be no significant distinctions of prediction accuracies between age groups and since the STAI are defined between 20 and 80, the predictions appeared reasonably accurate. The results indicate potential applications to practical situations such as stress management and medical practice.","2168-2372;21682372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2361757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6917199","Anxiety index;Blood oxygenation;Health and safety;Near Infrared spectroscopy;Neuronal activity;Oxyhemoglobin;Prediction methods;Prevention medicine;Regional cerebral blood flow;Translational engineering;blood oxygenation;health and safety;near infrared spectroscopy;neuronal activity;oxyhemoglobin;prediction methods;prevention medicine;regional cerebral blood flow;translational engineering","Bayes methods;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Indexes;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Stress","Bayes methods;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;bio-optics;biochemistry;blood;brain;diseases;geriatrics;infrared spectroscopy;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;molecular biophysics;neurophysiology;proteins","Bayesian algorithm;Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation;STAI;anxiety index prediction;cerebral blood oxygenation;deoxyhemoglobin concentration changes;machine learning algorithms;neurophysiological data;nonlinear basis function;oxyhemoglobin concentration changes;prefrontal cortex;root mean square errors;somatic diseases;state-trait anxiety inventory index;stress management;stress-induced psychological diseases;two-channel portable near-infrared spectroscopy device","","1","","33","","20141008","2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, most methods in the literature view this task as a special case of motion recognition. In contrast, we propose to employ the three main components of a physiotherapy exercise (the motion patterns, the stance knowledge, and the exercise object) as different recognition tasks and embed them separately into the recognition system. The low level information about each component is gathered using machine learning methods. Then, we use a generative Bayesian network to recognize the exercise types by combining the information from these sources at an abstract level, which takes the advantage of domain knowledge for a more robust system. Finally, a novel postprocessing step is employed to estimate the exercise repetitions counts. The performance evaluation of the system is conducted with a new dataset which contains RGB (red, green, and blue) and depth videos of home-based exercise sessions for commonly applied shoulder and knee exercises. The proposed system works without any body-part segmentation, bodypart tracking, joint detection, and temporal segmentation methods. In the end, favorable exercise recognition rates and encouraging results on the estimation of repetition counts are obtained.","1534-4320;15344320","","10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2326254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819433","Bayesian network;estimation of repetition count;exercise recognition;home-based physiotherapy","Bayes methods;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Patient monitoring;Patient rehabilitation;Pattern analysis;Sensors;Videos","belief networks;biomechanics;biomedical optical imaging;cameras;computer vision;image motion analysis;image recognition;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;object tracking;patient treatment;physiology","RGBD camera;abstract level;body-part segmentation;bodypart tracking;computer vision community;computerized recognition system;depth videos;domain knowledge;exercise object;exercise recognition rates;exercise repetition counts;exercise types;generative Bayesian network;home-based exercise sessions;home-based physiotherapy exercises;joint detection;low level information;machine learning methods;motion patterns;motion recognition;performance evaluation;postprocessing step;recognition tasks;repetition count estimation;shoulder and knee exercises;stance knowledge;temporal segmentation methods","0","5","","41","","20140521","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Dissimilarity increments are a measure over triplets of nearest neighbors. This family of algorithms is able to automatically find the number of clusters using a minimum description length criterion based on the dissimilarity increments distribution.

Promoted by these application scenarios, a number of similarity measures have been proposed and proposing. In these state-of-the-art measures, vector-based representation is widely accepted based on Vector Space Model (VSM) in which an object is represented as a vector composed of its features. Then, the similarity between two objects is evaluated by the operations on two corresponding vectors, like cosine, extended jaccard, extended dice and so on. However, there is an assumption that the features are independent of each others. This assumption is apparently unrealistic, and normally, there are relations between features, i.e. the co-occurrence relations between keywords in text mining area. In this paper, a space geometry-based method is proposed to extend the VSM from the orthogonal coordinate system (OVSM) to affine coordinate system (AVSM) and OVSM is proved to be a special case of AVSM. Unit coordinate vectors of AVSM are inferred by the relations between features which are considered as angles between these unit coordinate vectors. At last, five different similarity measures are extended from OVSM to AVSM using unit coordinate vectors of AVSM. Within the numerous application fields of similarity measures, the task of text clustering is selected to be the evaluation criterion. Documents are represented as vectors in OVSM and AVSM, respectively.

The relevance of a feature to the class variables are evaluated with mutual information and conditional mutual information is used to calculate the redundancy between the selected and the candidate features to each class variable.

The main defense paradigm in this regard is that the defender uses some kind of machine learning algorithms to train a detection model, which is then used to classify websites in question. Unlike other settings, the following issue is inherent to the problem of malicious websites detection: the attacker essentially has access to the same data that the defender uses to train his/her detection models. This `symmetry' can be exploited by the attacker, at least in principle, to evade the defender's detection models. In this paper, we present a framework for characterizing the evasion and counter-evasion interactions between the attacker and the defender, where the attacker attempts to evade the defender's detection models by taking advantage of this symmetry. Within this framework, we show that an adaptive attacker can make malicious websites evade powerful detection models, but proactive training can be an effective counter-evasion defense mechanism. The framework is geared toward the popular detection model of decision tree, but can be adapted to accommodate other classifiers.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5890-0; POD:978-1-4799-5891-7","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997494","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997494","Malicious websites;adaptive attacks;dynamic analysis;evasion;proactive training;static analysis","Adaptation models;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Security;Semantics;Training;Vectors","Web sites;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","Web site classification;adaptive attacker;counter-evasion defense mechanism;counter-evasion interactions;counter-evasion study;cyber attack;cyber defense task;decision tree;machine learning;malicious Web site detection;malicious Web sites detection","","9","","31","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, one of the common security issues and annoying problems faced by email users and organizations is receiving a large number of unsolicited email messages, known as spam emails, every day. A traditional countermeasure in most email systems nowadays is simple filtering mechanisms that can block or quarantine unwanted emails based on some keywords defined by the user. These filters require continual effort to keep them relevant and current with some extensions proposed to improve their performance. However, due to the gigantic volumes of received emails and the continual change in spamming techniques to bypass the implemented solutions, novel automated ideas and countermeasures need to be investigated. This paper explores a novel algorithm inspired by the immune system called dendritic cell algorithm (DCA). This algorithm is evaluated on a number of benchmark datasets to detect spam emails. The results demonstrate that this approach can be a promising solution for email classification and spam filtering.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4521-4; POD:978-1-4799-4520-7","10.1109/CICYBS.2014.7013372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013372","","Context;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Immune system;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring;Vectors","business communication;classification;information filtering;security of data;unsolicited e-mail","DCA;bio-inspired predictive model;business communications;dendritic cell algorithm;electronic mail;email classification;personal communications;security issues;spam filtering;unsolicited email messages","","0","","21","","","9-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The users label the reports as bugs or any other relevant class. This classification helps to decide which team or personnel would be responsible for dealing with an issue. A major problem here is that users tend to wrongly classify the issues, because of which a middleman called a bug triager is required to resolve any misclassifications. This ensures no time is wasted at the developer end. This approach is very time consuming and therefore it has been of great interest to automate the classification process, not only to speed things up, but to lower the amount of errors as well. In the literature, several approaches including machine learning techniques have been proposed to automate text classification. However, there has not been an extensive comparison on the performance of different natural language classifiers in this field. In this paper we compare general natural language data classifying techniques using five different machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, kNN, Pegasos, Rocchio and Perceptron. The performance comparison of these algorithms was done on the basis of their apparent error rates. The data-set involved four different projects, Httpclient, Jackrabbit, Lucene and Tomcat5, that used two different Bug Tracking Systems - Bugzilla and Jira.

We propose new algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor matching and evaluate and compare them with previous algorithms. For matching high dimensional features, we find two algorithms to be the most efficient: the randomized k-d forest and a new algorithm proposed in this paper, the priority search k-means tree. We also propose a new algorithm for matching binary features by searching multiple hierarchical clustering trees and show it outperforms methods typically used in the literature. We show that the optimal nearest neighbor algorithm and its parameters depend on the data set characteristics and describe an automated configuration procedure for finding the best algorithm to search a particular data set. In order to scale to very large data sets that would otherwise not fit in the memory of a single machine, we propose a distributed nearest neighbor matching framework that can be used with any of the algorithms described in the paper.

Here, we investigate an unsupervised incremental learning algorithm known as Incremental Knowledge Acquisition and Self Learning (IKASL) algorithm. IKASL algorithm is able to capture knowledge in an incremental manner, without disrupting past knowledge. Furthermore, IKASL algorithm encodes acquired knowledge in such a way that it can be used to acquire new knowledge more efficiently. This paper discusses several limitations of original IKASL algorithm and proposes several extensions to the original algorithm which enhances its performance. These modifications include influencing spread factor, implementing fuzzy integral based generalizing technique, etc. Furthermore, the paper report observations of several experiments conducted with several datasets to assess the necessity and value of incremental learning in the real world.

Most proposed cancer classification methods are from the statistical and machine learning area, ranging from the old nearest neighbor analysis, to the new support vector machines. There is no single classifier that is superior over the rest. A generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemia as a test case.

The main purpose of this paper is to analyze quality prediction using the IKS hybrid model with a new approach of data classification. We present the IKS hybrid model. The model combines selection of features, clustering and classification techniques. Three techniques are used (Information Gain (IG), K-means and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) over QWS dataset with collected 5,000 Web services. Our experiments and test results show that the proposed hybrid approach has achieved promising results in predicting the quality of web services and it represents a good basis for further development and research.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4136-0; POD:978-1-4799-4135-3","10.1109/BIHTEL.2014.6987636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987636","Hybrid model;Information Gain;K-means;Predicting;QWS;SVM","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Web services","Web services;feature selection;pattern classification;pattern clustering;support vector machines","IG technique;IKS hybrid model;QWS;QWS dataset;SVM technique;Web service providers;classification technique;clustering technique;data classification;feature selection;information gain technique;k-means technique;quality prediction analysis;quality-of-Web service prediction;support vector machine technique","","0","","25","","","27-29 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Poor nutrition and a lack of exercise have led to a situation where obesity is rapidly on the rise. As a result, mobile health interventions in the area of nutrition have been a great asset into changing the lives of many through the use of their devices. Smartphones and other mobile devices can be transformed into effective nutrition tracking tools that consumers can easily make use of to help improve their lives and wellbeing. The academic community has conducted a vast amount of research in the area of mobile nutrition however a number of challenges still exist in the area of human-computer interaction (HCI). HCI has been found to be a key contributing factor when developing systems that constantly and directly interact with their respective users. Effective HCI is required to bridge the communication barrier between a user and the device, thus ensuring a seam-less approach. This research paper highlights the efforts done by academics in the area of mobile HCI within the nutrition landscape. Every study will be discussed in detailed by highlighted the key benefits together with a number of challenges that still exist. As a result, this review of literature will identify key lacunae that still exist in the field of mobile HCI within the nutrition landscape.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4357-9; POD:978-1-4799-4356-2","10.1109/FiCloud.2014.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984234","diet management;human-computer interaction(HCI);mobile HCI;nutrition tracking","Conferences;Human computer interaction;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Monitoring;Support vector machines","health care;human computer interaction;mobile computing;smart phones","human-computer interaction patterns;mobile HCI;mobile computing;mobile devices;mobile health interventions;mobile nutrition landscape;nutrition tracking tools;obesity;smartphones","","2","","24","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing feature selection methods were designed for two-class classification problems. Multiclass feature selection algorithm is less available. R-SVM or Recursive SVM is a SVM-based embedded feature selection algorithm proposed by Zhang et al[5]. It provides the function of recursive feature selection and outperforms another similar method SVM-RFE (SVM Recursive Feature Elimination) on noisy data and has become popular in bioinformatics. But both R-SVM and SVM-RFE support only binary classification. We extend R-SVM to multi-class classification and also implement the multiclass SVM-RFE method in the workflow of R-SVM. Both methods achieve good performance applied to commonly used bioinformatics datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5403-2; POD:978-1-4799-5404-9; USB:978-1-4799-5402-5","10.1109/ChinaSIP.2014.6889298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889298","SVM;feature selection;multiclass","Bioinformatics;Cancer;Classification algorithms;Gene expression;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Tumors","bioinformatics;feature selection;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;support vector machines","R-SVM workflow;bioinformatics dataset;embedded feature selection algorithm;machine learning;multiclass SVM-RFE method;multiclass feature selection algorithm;recursive SVM;recursive feature elimination;support vector machine;two-class binary classification problem","","0","","21","","","9-13 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evolutionary rule learning approaches employ an evolutionary algorithm, such as a genetic algorithm, to perform both these search operations simultaneously. This approach often leads to significant problems including population bloating and stalled evolutionary search in real-valued attribute problems, especially with higher dimensions. In this paper, we present an online evolutionary rule learning approach referred to as ERL-AID that decouples the above search processes and employs a discretization algorithm that works on the attribute space and a genetic algorithm to combine the discretized attributes into appropriate classification rules. ERL-AID applies a sliding window approach to process inputs in an online fashion. The proposed system is able to produce compact rule sets with competitive performance and could scale to higher dimensions. The experimental results show the competitiveness of our algorithm.","1089-778X;1089778X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6626-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-1488-3; POD:978-1-4799-1486-9","10.1109/CEC.2014.6900623","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900623","","Accuracy;Arrays;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Training","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","ERL-AID;classification rule induction;discretization algorithm;genetic algorithm;incremental attribute discretization;online evolutionary rule learning algorithm;population bloating;real-valued attribute problem;stalled evolutionary search","","0","","21","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bedford Taylor","University of San Diego, University of California, San Diego","2014 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","20141215","2014","","","76","79","These days, many traditional end-user applications are said to “run fast enough” on existing machines, so the search continues for novel applications that can leverage the new capabilities of our evolving hardware. Foremost of these potential applications are those that are clustered around information processing capabilities that humans have today but are lacking in computers. The fact that brains can perform these computations serves as an existence proof that these applications are realizable. At the same time, we often discover that the human nervous system, with its 80 billion neurons, on some metrics, is more powerful and energy-efficient than today's machines. Both of these aspects make this class of applications a desirable target for an architectural benchmark suite, because there is evidence that these applications are both useful and computationally challenging. This paper details CortexSuite, a Synthetic Brain Benchmark Suite, which seeks to capture this workload. We classify and identify benchmarks within CortexSuite by analogy to the human neural processing function. We use the major lobes of the cerebral cortex as a model for the organization and classification of data processing algorithms. To be clear, our goal is not to emulate the brain at the level of the neuron, but rather to collect together synthetic, man-made algorithms that have similar function and have met with success in the real world. We consulted six world-class machine learning and computer vision researchers, who collectively hold 83,091 citations across their distinct subareas, asking them to identify newly emerging computationally-intensive algorithms or applications that are going to have a large impact over the next ten years. This is coupled with datasets that reflect the philosophy of practical use algorithms and are coded in “clean C” so as to make them accessible, analyzable, and usable for parallel and approximate compiler and architecture r- searchers alike.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6454-3; POD:978-1-4799-6455-0; USB:978-1-4799-6453-6","10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983043","","Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Classification algorithms;Computer vision;Data processing;Image resolution;Machine learning algorithms","brain;computer vision;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neurophysiology","C language;CortexSuite;cerebral cortex;computer vision;data processing algorithms;human nervous system;human neural processing function;information processing capabilities;machine learning;man-made algorithms;neuron;synthetic brain benchmark suite","","2","","9","","","26-28 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
