Recently, many such classifiers are trained with Web pages which are labeled manually or extracted from the open directory project (ODP), and then the classifiers judge the topical relevance of WebPages pointed to by hyperlinks in the crawler frontier. Though one can obtain labeled WebPages with comparative ease, however, training the classifiers with Web pages violates the overall hypothesis of machine learning about i.i.d (independent and identical distribution) between training and testing sets because the classification instances are hyperlinks (URLs) instead of WebPages. For the reason, this paper investigates and proposes a novel method based on templates for automatically labeling the positive URLs to develop classifier-guided topical crawlers. A series of off-line and on-line experiments are performed extensively. The results demonstrate that the classifier-guided topical crawler trained with labeled URLs has higher recall than the one trained with labeled WebPages. The results also prove that the classifier using immediate vicinity of hyperlinks and the corresponding anchor texts leads the crawler to attain harvest rate of about 95%.","","POD:978-0-7695-3810-5","10.1109/SKG.2009.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5370119","SVM;classifier;link context;topical crawler;training set","Bayesian methods;Crawlers;Educational institutions;Labeling;Machine learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing;Uniform resource locators;Web pages","Web sites;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","URL;Web pages;classifier-guided topical crawler;hyperlinks;independent and identical distribution;machine learning;open directory project","","0","1","16","","","12-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present three different reinforcement learning algorithms, which generate a dynamic policy by changing the number of concurrent running jobs according to the job types and machine state. The algorithms outperform manually-tuned policies for the entire range of checked workloads, with average throughput improvement greater than 20%. On multi-core servers, the average throughput improvement is approximately 40%, which hints at the enormous improvement potential of such a tuning mechanism with the gradual transition to multi-core machines.","","CD-ROM:978-1-59593-764-3; POD:978-1-59593-764-3","10.1145/1362622.1362666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5348823","","Delay;Grid computing;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization methods;Permission;Radio access networks;System performance;Throughput;Workstations","","","","3","","23","","","10-16 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, we present a systematic process to convert existing state-of-the-art detection rules into a probabilistic model. We illustrate this process by generating a model to detect occurrences of the Blob antipattern. Second, we present results of the validation of the model: we built this model on two open-source programs, GanttProject v1.10.2 and Xerces v2.7.0, and measured its accuracy. Third, we compare our model with another approach to show that it returns the same candidate classes while ordering them to minimise the quality analysts' effort.

The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a Â¿gray boxÂ¿ since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve competitive detection accuracy as well as refined learning model structure.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-3836-5; POD:978-1-4244-3835-8","10.1109/AICI.2009.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376342","decision tree;intrusion detection;perceptron tree;tree pruning","Artificial intelligence;Binary trees;Computational intelligence;Computer security;Decision trees;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons","learning (artificial intelligence);perceptrons;security of data;trees (mathematics)","binary tree structure;expert neural networks;gray box;intrusion detection approach;perceptron tree learning model;refined learning model structure","","2","","16","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is difficult to extract the partial correspondences correctly and efficiently in the data sparse corpus. In this paper, we propose a new learning method that extracts the partial correspondences solely from the parallel corpus without any analytical tools. In the proposed method, the extraction rules are automatically acquired from bilingual sentences using bi-gram statistics in each language sentence and the similarity based on Dice coefficient between SL words and TL words. The acquired extraction rules possess information about the first parts(e.g., ""a"", ""the"") or the last parts in phrases. Moreover, the partial correspondences are extracted from the bilingual sentences using the extraction rules correctly and efficiently. Evaluation experiments indicated that our proposed method can improve the translation quality of the learning-type machine translation by correctly and efficiently extracting the partial correspondences in bilingual sentences.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3904-1; POD:978-1-4244-5318-4","10.1109/IALP.2009.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380752","extraction rule;learning;machine translation;parallel corpus;partial correspondence","Data mining;Dictionaries;Feedback;Frequency;Information science;Learning systems;Machine learning;Natural languages;Statistics;Surface-mount technology","information retrieval;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","Dice coefficient;bi-gram statistics;bilingual sentences;data sparse corpus;learning-type machine translation;parallel corpus;partial correspondence extraction rule;source language;target language;translation quality","","1","1","11","","","7-9 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Blog classification using machine learning techniques is a key method towards doing it. We have devised a machine learning algorithm where features are created from individual sentences in the body of a blog by taking one word at a time. Weights are assigned to the features based on the strength of their predictive capabilities for illegitimate/legitimate determination. The predictive capabilities are estimated by the frequency of occurrence of the feature in illegitimate/legitimate collections. During classification, total illegitimate and legitimate evidence in the blog is obtained by summing up the weights of extracted features of each class and the message is classified into whichever class accumulates the greater sum. We compared the algorithm against the popular Naive Bayes algorithm and found its performance does not deteriorate in the least than that of Naive Bayes algorithm both in terms of catching blog spam and for reducing false positives.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3925-6; Electronic:978-0-7695-3925-6; POD:978-1-4244-5365-8","10.1109/ICCEE.2009.202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380215","blogs;illegitimate;legitimate;naive bayes;spam;weights","Blogs;Computer science;Feature extraction;Filtering;Filters;Frequency estimation;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Postal services;Probability","","","","0","","9","","","28-30 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We design a Modified Topic Relevance Retrieval System (MTRRS) containing query formulation and a combination model. To design the query, manual adjustment and machine learning are used. During the machine learning processing, we define a center word list which helps to generate a novel distance feature. The result can be improved 22.97% on MAP by query formulation.

Application of FSAs in the bioinformatics domain has become a necessity due to enormous growth of public sequence databases. This paper provides an experimental framework on the use of rough set theory (RST) as FSAs in finding minimal feature subsets for classifying protein function. In experimenting RST, three different recent models are explored; Correlation feature selection (CFS), FCBF (fast correlation-based filter) and artificial immune system (AIS). The experimental study for these FSAs are based on four criteria: the accuracy (AC), the area under ROC graph (ROC), the length of the reducts (ARL), and the time taken (TT). Classification was performed on the reduced feature set using the support vector machine algorithm. The results demonstrate that CFS and FCBF performs better if the main objectives are to measure the accuracy and ROC, however in terms of duration and rule length, RST is a better choice.","","POD:978-1-4244-5330-6","10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368659","","Artificial immune systems;Bioinformatics;Filters;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Proteins;Set theory;Spatial databases;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","bioinformatics;database management systems;learning (artificial intelligence);proteins;rough set theory;support vector machines","ROC graph;artificial immune system;bioinformatics domain;correlation feature selection;fast correlation-based filter;feature selection algorithms;machine learning;protein function classification;public sequence databases;rough set theory;support vector machine algorithm","","0","","39","","","4-7 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel method to tag words sentiment automatically is proposed. In this method, a word association graph is firstly constructed from text corpus, i.e. product reviews, in which each node is a word and if there is an edge between two words, it means the two words co-occur in the same sentence.

It has always characterised one of the biggest challenges in Computer Science for the last decades. Because time and cost estimate at the early stages of the software development are the most difficult to obtain, and they are often the least accurate. Traditional algorithmic techniques such as regression models, Software Life Cycle Management (SLIM), COCOMO model, function points, etc, require an estimation process in a long term. But, nowadays that is not acceptable for software developers and companies. Newer soft computing techniques to effort estimation based on non-algorithmic techniques such as Fuzzy Logic (FL) may offer an alternative for solving the problem. This work aims to propose a fuzzy logic realistic model to achieve more accuracy in software effort estimation. In this innovative model, by applying fuzzy logic and using training procedure to the system, the accuracy of the results is desirable in comparison with the famous traditional algorithmic technique, COCOMO II model. This novelty model will lead researchers to focus on non-algorithmic models to overcome the estimation problems. Our validation experiment was carried out on artificial dataset as well as the COCOMO standard dataset.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3925-6; Electronic:978-0-7695-3925-6; POD:978-1-4244-5365-8","10.1109/ICCEE.2009.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380198","COCOMO model;Software engineering;soft computing techniques;software cost estimation models","Computer science;Costs;Fuzzy logic;Life estimation;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Programming;Software algorithms;Software engineering;Software performance","fuzzy logic;software cost estimation;software performance evaluation","COCOMO II model;computer science;fuzzy logic realistic model;nonalgorithmic techniques;regression models;soft computing techniques;software cost estimation;software development effort estimation;software life cycle management;training procedure","","0","","15","","","28-30 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Feature selection is to increase the classification performance of skin symptom. In this paper, the effects of feature selection on the classification of 4-class skin symptoms (chloasma, blackhead, freckled and comedone) are analyzed. Support vector machine (SVM) is employed to construct classifier, the parameters setting is very crucial to the learning results and generalization ability of SVM, and many irrelevant and redundant features degrade the performance of classification, furthermore, the choice of SVM parameters is influenced by the feature subset taken into account and vice versa. So a joint optimization method for selecting features and SVM parameters is proposed. Genetic algorithms, which have a lot of improvements about fitness, crossover and mutation in comparison with simple genetic algorithms, is to achieve a balance between the classification accuracy and the size of the feature subsets selected and have a fast convergence rate. Furthermore, `one-against-one' approach is used to solve multi-class classification problems and a comparison of the model performances is made among the results of the joint optimization and the single optimization of features or SVM parameters in the experiments. The simulation result shows that our approach can find subsets of features for 4-class skin symptoms classification with higher average cross validation accuracy and a higher rate of convergence compared with single optimization of features or SVM parameters.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-3836-5; POD:978-1-4244-3835-8","10.1109/AICI.2009.175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376244","Classification;Genetic Algorithm;Support Vector Machines (SVM)","Artificial intelligence;Convergence;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Search problems;Skin;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;medical image processing;set theory;skin;support vector machines","automatic skin symptom recognition;blackhead;chloasma;comedone;feature subset;freckled;genetic algorithms;joint feature selection optimization;multi-class SVM;multi-class classification problems;skin diagnosis;skin treatment;support vector machine","","0","","17","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing methods for coreference resolution make use of attribute-value features over pairs of noun phrases, which can't adequately describe the coreference conditions and properties between noun phrases. In this paper, we present a new approach to coreference resolution by combining Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Markov Logic Network (MLN), which excels such existing approaches as just considering inductive logic or probabilistic reasoning respectively. The ILP technique is used to capture the relationships among coreferential mentions based on first-order rules. With MLN's powerful representational ability, the previous findings are easily assimilated into MLN. Moreover, we can add specific rules about coreference resolution into MLN. After MLN's learning and inference, whether two mentions are coreferential is decided from the global view. Evaluations on the ACE data set show that our method is promising for the coreference resolution task.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3904-1; POD:978-1-4244-5318-4","10.1109/IALP.2009.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380798","ILP;MLN;coreference resolution","Application software;Computer science;Data mining;Laboratories;Logic programming;Machine learning;Pain;Probabilistic logic;Statistical analysis;Testing","Markov processes;formal logic;inductive logic programming;inference mechanisms;natural language processing","ILP;MLN;Markov logic network;coreference resolution;first-order rules;inductive logic programming;probabilistic reasoning","","0","","21","","","7-9 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evolution from simple token-based to segment-based to tree-based syntactic SMT is sketched. For tree-based SMT, we consider language bias rationales for selecting the degree of compositional power within the hierarchy of expressiveness for transduction grammars (or synchronous grammars). This leads us to inversion transductions and the ITG model prevalent in current state-of-the-art SMT, along with the underlying ITG hypothesis, which posits a language universal. Against this backdrop, we enumerate a set of key open questions for syntactic SMT. We then consider the more recent area of semantic SMT. We list principles for successful application of sense disambiguation models to semantic SMT, and describe early directions in the use of semantic role labeling for semantic SMT.","","POD:978-1-4244-5478-5","10.1109/ASRU.2009.5373509","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373509","","Computer science;Hardware;Humans;Labeling;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Space technology;Speech recognition;Statistics;Surface-mount technology","computational linguistics;language translation;programming language semantics;statistics","SMT semantic;hierarchy transduction grammars;inversion transductions;semantics;sense disambiguation models;set key open;socio geographical conceptual;statistical machine translation;statistics;syntax;three dimensional MT model space;token based evolution;toward machine translation;tree based syntactic SMT","","1","","54","","","Nov. 13 2009-Dec. 17 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Finally, we designed three experiments for comparing, and the results of experiments indicated the algorithm could be used for dimension reduction effectively, and it did really improve the accurate rate in text classification.","","POD:978-0-7695-3874-7","10.1109/WISA.2009.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5370608","Local Linear Embedding Algorithm;Supervised Learning;Support Vector Machine;Text Classification","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Filters;Information systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Text categorization","support vector machines;text analysis","SVM text classification algorithm;dimension reduction;supervised learning;supervised local linear embedding;support vector machine","","1","","14","","","18-20 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the paper, a modified SVM classifier based on RS is proposed in medical disease prediction. RS not only provides new scientific logic and research method for information and cognitive science, but also develops effective preprocessing techniques for intelligent information process. It can find out these relevant features influencing the medical disease.

However, one of the major problems of using association rule mining for associative classification is the very large search space of possible rules which usually leads to a very complex rule discovery process. This paper proposes a multiple-step rule discovery approach for associative classification called Mstep-AC. The proposed Mstep-AC approach focuses on discovering effective rules for data samples that might cause misclassification in order to enhance classification accuracy. Although the rule discovery process in Mstep-AC is performed multiple times to mine effective rules, its complexity is comparable with conventional associative classification approach.

In the proposed approach, first the chance constraints are converted into their deterministic equivalent in the decision making environment. Then, the individual best and worst solutions of each of the objectives are determined for fuzzy description of them in the context of making decision. In the model formulation of the problem, the concept of tolerance membership functions are defined for measuring the degree of satisfaction of the decision maker (DM) with the solution for achievement of the fuzzily described objectives of the problem. In the executable FGP model, minimization of under-deviational variables of the membership goals defined for the membership functions for achievement of the highest membership value (unity) of each of them to the extent possible on the basis of their weights of importance is taken into consideration. In the solution process, the quadratic in form of the defined deterministic constraints are transformed into the linear form by using the Taylor series approximation method to solve the problem by employing the linear FGP methodology and thereby to reach a satisfactory decision. To illustrate the proposed approach, a numerical example is solved. The model solution is compared with the additive FGP approach studied previously.","2377-6927;23776927","POD:978-1-4244-4786-2","10.1109/ICADVC.2009.5378202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5378202","Chance Constrained Programming;Fuzzy Goal Programming;Fuzzy Programming;Stochastic Programming;Taylor Series Approximation","Alzheimer's disease;Data mining;Decision making;Dementia;Linear approximation;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Neural networks;Neurons;Senior citizens","approximation theory;decision making;decision theory;fuzzy set theory;mathematical programming","Taylor series approximation method;chance constrained multiobjective decision making problems;deterministic constraints;fuzzy goal programming formulation;linear FGP methodology;linear approximation approach;tolerance membership functions","","2","","17","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classification based on association rules is one of the most effective classification method, whose accuracy is higher and discovered rules are easier to understand comparing with classical classification methods. However, current algorithms for classification based on association rules is single table oriented, which means they can only apply to the data stored in a single relational table. Directly applying these algorithms in multi-relational data environment will result in many problems. This paper proposes a novel algorithm MrCAR for classification based on association rules in multi-relational data environment. MrCAR mines relevant features in each table to predict the class label.

These physical-chemical parameters have influence on the entire lake web food chain, thus disturbing the organism's patterns and interactions between them, such as diatoms community. These communities have where high coefficient of indication on certain process such as eutrophication, which means that they can be used as bio-indicators of water quality. The CN2 algorithm can produce rules in a form IF-THEN which is suitable for organizing knowledge from diatoms abundance data. In literature the diatoms have ecological preference organized in the same manner. The experimental setup is build to satisfy not only the algorithm properties, but also the ecological knowledge of the diatoms community. We used several modifications of the algorithm, from which we compare the classification accuracy or rule quality to point which experiment proved to be most accuracy and more general. Several of the rules are presented in this paper together with the evaluation performance. Based on modifications of the CN2 algorithm parameters, we were able to extract certain knowledge form the data, which later have proved to be valid, or in some cases is novel for many newly discovered diatoms.

Recently due to the vast improvement in machine learning and pattern recognition methods many computer scientists have applied these methods to solve this problem. However, protein folding problem is much more complicated than ordinary machine learning problems because of its natural complexity imposed by the high dimensionality of feature space and diversity of different protein fold classes. To deal with such a challenging problem, we use an ensemble classifier model by applying MLP and RBF Neural Networks and Bayesian ensemble method. Also we have used the Laplace estimation method in order to smooth confusion matrices of the base classifiers. Experimental results imply that RBF Neural Network holds better Correct Classification Rate (CCR) compared to other common classification methods such as MLP networks. Our experiments also show that the Bayesian fusion method can improve the correct classification rate of proteins up to 20% with the final CCR of 59% by reducing both bias and variance error of the RBF classifiers, on a benchmark dataset containing 27 SCOP folds.","","POD:978-1-4244-5330-6","10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368628","Bayesian Classifier Fusion;MLP;Protein Folding;RBF","Amino acids;Artificial neural networks;Bayesian methods;Biology computing;Computer networks;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons;Pattern recognition;Proteins","Bayes methods;biology computing;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;pattern recognition;radial basis function networks","Bayesian ensemble method;Laplace estimation method;MLP method;RBF neural networks;correct classification rate;machine learning;protein fold pattern recognition","","1","","27","","","4-7 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, an emerging trend of representing objects by graphs can be observed. As a matter of fact, graphs offer a versatile alternative to feature vectors in many subfields of intelligent information processing, including pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. However, the space of graphs contains almost no mathematical structure, and consequently, there is a lack of suitable methods for graph classification, clustering and related tasks. In this talk, we propose a general approach to transforming graphs into n-dimensional real vector spaces by means of graph dissimilarity. As a matter of fact, this approach makes all algorithmic tools originally developed for feature vectors instantly available to graphs. In particular, it leads to a novel family of graph kernels. Moreover, the embedding procedure allows one to generate, in a straightforward way, systems for classification and clustering that involve multiple experts. With various experimental results we prove the robustness and flexibility of this new approach and show that it outperforms standard graph classification and clustering methods on several graph data sets of diverse nature.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3866-2; POD:978-1-4244-5297-2","10.1109/DICTA.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5384865","","Artificial intelligence;Books;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Information processing;Kernel;Learning systems;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Robustness","graph theory;pattern classification;pattern clustering","data mining;dissimilarity space embedding;graph classification method;graph clustering method;graph data sets;graph dissimilarity;graph kernels;intelligent information processing;machine learning;mathematical structure;object representation;pattern recognition","","0","","","","","1-3 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a capability enables a considerable number of applications, but the goal is both ill-posed and NP-hard in general. In this paper we develop (a) a new uncertainty principle for matrices, and (b) a simple method for exact decomposition based on convex optimization. Our uncertainty principle is a quantification of the notion that a matrix cannot be sparse while having diffuse row/column spaces. It characterizes when the decomposition problem is ill-posed, and forms the basis for our decomposition method and its analysis. We provide deterministic conditions - on the sparse and low-rank components - under which our method guarantees exact recovery.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5871-4; POD:978-1-4244-5870-7","10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394889","","Computational complexity;Laboratories;Machine learning;Matrix decomposition;Optimization methods;Sparse matrices;System identification;Uncertainty","matrix decomposition;optimisation;sparse matrices","NP-hard problem;convex optimization;ill-posed;low rank matrix decomposition;notion quantification;sparse matrix","","30","","18","","","Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We trained our approaches using T1-weighted brain MRIs from 30 subjects [10 normal elderly, 10 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD)], and tested on an independent set of 40 subjects (20 normal, 20 AD). Manually segmented gold standard hippocampal tracings were available for all subjects (training and testing). We assessed each approach's accuracy relative to manual segmentations, and its power to map AD effects. We then converted the segmentations into parametric surfaces to map disease effects on anatomy. After surface reconstruction, we computed significance maps, and overall corrected <i>p</i>-values, for the 3-D profile of shape differences between AD and normal subjects. Our AdaBoost and Ada-SVM segmentations compared favorably with the manual segmentations and detected disease effects as well as FreeSurfer on the data tested. Cumulative <i>p</i>-value plots, in conjunction with the false discovery rate method, were used to examine the power of each method to detect correlations with diagnosis and cognitive scores. We also evaluated how segmentation accuracy depended on the size of the training set, providing practical information for future users of this technique.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2009.2021941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4957035","AdaBoost;Alzheimer's disease;hippocampal segmentation;support vector machines (SVMs);surface modeling","Alzheimer's disease;Anatomy;Gold;Machine learning algorithms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Packaging machines;Senior citizens;Support vector machines;Surface reconstruction;Testing","biomedical MRI;diseases;feature extraction;image segmentation;medical image processing;support vector machines","AdaBoost;Alzheimer's disease detection;FreeSurfer;T1 weighted brain MRI;automated hippocampal segmentation;feature selection;machine learning;support vector machines","Algorithms;Alzheimer Disease;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Hippocampus;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging","73","","72","","20090519","Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These support vector methods implicitly assume that training data in the optimization problems to be known exactly. But in practice, the training data are usually subjected to measurement noise. Zhao et al proposed robust version to Bounded C - SVMs, Bounded Â¿-SVMs and Lagrangian SVMs (LSVMs) respectively with perturbations in convex polyhedrons and ellipsoids. The region of perturbation in the methods mentioned above is not general, and there are many perturbations in non-convex regions in practice. Therefore we proposed unsupervised and semi-supervised classification problems based on Lagrangian Support Vector Machines with general polyhedral perturbations. But the problem has difficulty to compute, we will find its semi-definite relaxation that can approximate it well.

Binary coding is adopted in which an individual in a population consists of a fixed number of weight that stand for a solution candidate. The evaluation function considers error rate of decision tree over the test set. Three common operators for genetic algorithm such as random mutation and single-point crossover is applied for the population. Finally the algorithm returns an individual with the highest fitness as a local optimal weight. Based on four databases from UCI, we compared our approach with several other traditional decision tree pruning techniques including cost-complexity pruning, Pessimistic Error Pruning and Reduced error pruning.

This paper proposes a genetic programming (GP) approach to FS where the building blocks are subsets of features and set operators. We use bit-mask representation for subsets and a set of set operators as primitive functions. The GP search, then combines these subsets and set operations to find an optimal subset of features. The task we study is a highly imbalanced face detection problem. A modified version of the NaiÂ¿ve Bayes classification model is used as the fitness function.

However, little progress has been made in incorporating them into spectral clustering. In this paper, we propose a new method to combine pairwise constraints with spectral clustering and apply it to SAR image segmentation. Firstly, we learn a distance metric using pairwise constraints. In doing so, an affinity matrix is obtained by the Gaussian function on the learned distance metric. Then we perform the spectral decomposition on the affinity matrix and we get the spectral features of data points. Finally, the constrained k-means is used to cluster spectral features instead of k-means used commonly. We apply the proposed method to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image segmentation.

As we know, NystroÂ¿m algorithm is a random selecting method which depends so much on the selecting result so that the clustering result fluctuates obviously. Greedy spectral clustering algorithm acquires a subset called dictionary by greedy selection algorithm so that the result could be more stable and better. However, to choose an appropriate input tolerance, we need prior experiment knowledge about the relationship between tolerance and select number. Moreover, since the criterion used for greedy selection is the distance in feature space between a candidate example and its projection on the subspace spanned by selected examples, we need to compute every example point one by one to get the error of using the selected examples to approximate the candidate example and then decide whether to choose it. So the time expense increases inevitable. Considering all above, we present a new method called immune greedy spectral clustering algorithm. The experimental results show that immune greedy spectral clustering algorithm need no prior experiment knowledge and could save time compared with greedy spectral clustering while getting a better accuracy rate compared with NystroÂ¿m algorithm.","","POD:978-1-4244-2731-4","10.1109/APSAR.2009.5374116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374116","Immune Clone Selection;Nyström algorithm;greedy spectral embedding;spectral clustering","Cloning;Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrix;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Graph theory;Image segmentation;Information processing;Laboratories;Machine learning algorithms;Very large scale integration","image segmentation;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","NystroÂ¿m algorithm;SAR image segmentation;greedy selection algorithm;immune clone selection algorithm;immune greedy spectral clustering algorithm","","0","","12","","","26-30 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
