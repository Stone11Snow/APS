"A Blocking Strategy to Improve Gene Selection for Classification of Gene Expression Data","G. Bontempi","Departement d'Informatique, Univ. Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","20070507","2007","4","2","293","300","Because of high dimensionality, machine learning algorithms typically rely on feature selection techniques in order to perform effective classification in microarray gene expression data sets. However, the large number of features compared to the number of samples makes the task of feature selection computationally hard and prone to errors. This paper interprets feature selection as a task of stochastic optimization, where the goal is to select among an exponential number of alternative gene subsets the one expected to return the highest generalization in classification. Blocking is an experimental design strategy which produces similar experimental conditions to compare alternative stochastic configurations in order to be confident that observed differences in accuracy are due to actual differences rather than to fluctuations and noise effects. We propose an original blocking strategy for improving feature selection which aggregates in a paired way the validation outcomes of several learning algorithms to assess a gene subset and compare it to others. This is a novelty with respect to conventional wrappers, which commonly adopt a sole learning algorithm to evaluate the relevance of a given set of variables. The rationale of the approach is that, by increasing the amount of experimental conditions under which we validate a feature subset, we can lessen the problems related to the scarcity of samples and consequently come up with a better selection. The paper shows that the blocking strategy significantly improves the performance of a conventional forward selection for a set of 16 publicly available cancer expression data sets. The experiments involve six different classifiers and show that improvements take place independent of the classification algorithm used after the selection step. Two further validations based on available biological annotation support the claim that blocking strategies in feature selection may improve the accuracy and the quality of the solut- - ion. The first validation is based on retrieving PubMEd abstracts associated to the selected genes and matching them to regular expressions describing the biological phenomenon underlying the expression data sets. The biological validation that follows is based on the use of the Bioconductor package GoStats in order to perform gene ontology statistical analysis","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2007.1014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196539","Bioinformatics (genome or protein) databases;data mining;feature evaluation and selection.;machine learning","Aggregates;Cancer;Classification algorithms;Design for experiments;Fluctuations;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Machine learning algorithms;Stochastic processes;Stochastic resonance","cancer;data mining;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;molecular biophysics;ontologies (artificial intelligence);optimisation;statistical analysis;stochastic processes","bioconductor package GoStats;blocking strategy;cancer expression;data classification;feature selection;fluctuations;gene ontology statistical analysis;gene selection;learning algorithms;machine learning;microarray gene expression;noise effects","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Gene Expression Profiling;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Proteome;Signal Transduction","20","","35","","","April-June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is assumed that a training set of samples to be accepted or rejected is available but neither the a priori probabilities or the probability density functions of the measurements that describe the samples are known. The discriminant functions are formed from a given topology with unknown sets of weighting resistors assigned to the elements that constitute the classification network. Computer optimization is done using a hill-climbing technique that maximizes a function related to the miss rate and false alarm rate but requires neither an estimate or exact description of the sample probability space. A particular advantage is the one-to-one correspondence between the results of the optimization program and physical realization of the optimal recognition network. Disadvantages are due to the fact that an optimum can be found only with respect to a given topology and that the optimization algorithm may prematurely terminate on a local maximum.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/T-C.1969.222547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1671140","Discriminant functions, false alarm rate, hill-climbing techniques, learning machines, miss rate, optimization, pattern recognition.","Computer networks;Density measurement;Error analysis;Machine learning;Network topology;Pattern recognition;Probability density function;Resistors;Signal processing algorithms;Transfer functions","","Discriminant functions, false alarm rate, hill-climbing techniques, learning machines, miss rate, optimization, pattern recognition.","","2","","13","","","Oct. 1969","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we evaluate an extended version of this system, applied for the first time to a natural image interpretation domain. Performance of MR ADORE system is compared to the hierarchical hidden Markov random field (HHRMF) algorithm for supervised image annotation. We show that a hybrid system, easily constructed by utilizing the HHMRF models as operators within MR ADORE, performs significantly better than either of the systems on their own.

It employs the AQ learning to generate hypotheses discriminating between groups of high and low fitness individuals, and then uses these hypotheses to generate new individuals. On the other hand pattern search is a class of direct search for derivative-free optimization with accurately established global convergence properties. Pattern search makes no use of derivative information, which might be unavailable, too expensive, or misleading.

If exams are performed online, how can the course provider guarantee that the student participating in the exam is the person enrolled? Without any Internet-based form of authenticating the student's identity, flexible delivery can break down at this point. As a consequence, traditional identity checks are introduced such as requiring the student to be physically present and to take the exam at a local institution, or requiring the student to sign documents that certify his/her identity. This paper discusses assessment in flexible delivery and how plagiarism can be detected. It presents a method for testing the identity of a student (or more generally, author) online, without any interference with the examination process. Recent advances in computational text analysis allow authorship identification with high reliability.

The example treated has the additional interesting aspect that the data does not have structure that would enable the machine to learn in the nonsupervised mode alone; but the additional nonsupervised learning can provide substantial improvement over the results obtainable by supervised learning alone.

Firstly we describe our experimental system-a real time graphic driving simulator-for collecting and modeling human driving behaviors. Using the proposed machine learning method hidden Markov model (HMM), the individual driving behavior model is derived and then we demonstrate the procedure for recognizing different drivers through analyzing the corresponding models. Then we define performance measures for evaluating our resultant learning models using a hidden-Markov-model-(HMM)-based similarity measure, which helps us to derive the similarity of individual behavior and corresponding model.

It is thus important to automatically identify which links are most relevant for categorization. In this paper, we present a contextual dependency network (CDN) model for classifying linked objects in the presence of noisy and irrelevant links. The CDN model makes use of a dependency function that characterizes the contextual dependencies among linked objects. In this way, CDNs can differentiate the impacts of the related objects on the classification and consequently reduce the effect of irrelevant links on the classification. We show how to learn the CDN model effectively and how to use the Gibbs inference framework over the learned model for collective classification of multiple linked objects.

Some techniques have been proposed for fast learning of SCFGs probabilities, yet, of those, only the HOLA technique can perform learning incrementally. In this paper, two incremental versions of the graphical EM (gEM) technique are proposed. The incremental gEM (igEM) and on-line incremental gEM (oigEM) allow for adapting production rule probabilities from new data, without having to retrain from the start on all accumulated training data. These new techniques are compared to HOLA using radar signal data. An experimental protocol has been defined such that the impact on performance of factors like the size of new data blocks for incremental learning, and the level of ambiguity of MFR grammars, may be observed. Results indicate that, contrary to HOLA, incremental learning of training data blocks with igEM and oigEM provides the same level of accuracy as learning from all cumulative data from scratch, even for small data blocks. As expected, incremental learning significantly reduces the overall time and memory complexities.

However, the resultant algorithms may converge to some undesired degenerate solutions (nonzero but singular or ill-conditioned solutions). This paper discusses and analyzes the problem of degenerate solutions in detail. To solve this problem, a novel nonleast-squares criterion for approximate nonorthogonal joint diagonalization is proposed and an efficient algorithm, called fast approximate joint diagonalization (FAJD), is developed. As compared with the existing nonorthogonal diagonalization algorithms, the new algorithm can not only avoid the trivial solution but also any degenerate solutions.

Similar to support vector machine (SVM) methodology, MSM training is formulated as a multicriteria optimization problem which aims at maximizing the separation margin and minimizing the empirical error rate on training data simultaneously. By making certain relaxation assumptions, MSM training can be reformulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem that can be solved efficiently by some standard optimization algorithms designed for SDP. Evaluation experiments are conducted on the task of the recognition of most confusable Kanji character pairs identified from popular Nakayosi and Kuchibue handwritten Japanese character databases.

In this paper, a novel distribution-index-based discretizer is proposed for such a transformation. Based on definitions of dichotomic entropy and a compound distributional index, a simple criterion is applied to discretize continuous attributes adaptively. The dichotomic entropy indicates the homogeneity degree of the decision value distribution, and is applied to determine the best splitting point. The compound distributional index combines both the homogeneity degrees of attribute value distributions and the decision value distribution, and is applied to determine which interval should be split further; thus, a potentially improved solution of the discretization problem can be found efficiently. Based on multiple reducts in rough set theory, a multiknowledge approach can attain high decision accuracy for information systems with a large number of attributes and missing values. In this paper, our discretizer is combined with the multiknowledge approach to further improve decision accuracy for information systems with continuous attributes. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the new discretizer can improve not only the multiknowledge approach, but also the naive Bayes classifier and the C5.0 tree","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.250582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016512","Data mining;decision support.;information theory;machine learning","Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Distributed decision making;Entropy;Information systems;Machine learning;Set theory;Testing","data mining;database indexing;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence)","C5.0 tree;attribute value distribution;benchmark data set;compound distributional index;decision value distribution;decision-making;dichotomic entropy;distribution-index-based discretizer;homogeneity degree;multiknowledge approach;naive Bayes classifier;rough set theory;symbolic AI approach","","7","","15","","","Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of MESO, a pattern classifier designed to support online, incremental learning and decision making in autonomic systems. A novel feature of MESO is its use of small agglomerative clusters, called sensitivity spheres, that aggregate similar training samples. Sensitivity spheres are partitioned into sets during the construction of a memory-efficient hierarchical data structure. This structure facilitates data compression, which is important to many autonomic systems. Results are presented demonstrating that MESO achieves high accuracy while enabling rapid incremental training and classification. A case study is described in which MESO enables a mobile computing application to learn, by imitation, user preferences for balancing wireless network packet loss and bandwidth consumption.

TSVMs exploit specific iterative algorithms which gradually search a reliable separating hyperplane (in the kernel space) with a transductive process that incorporates both labeled and unlabeled samples in the training phase. Based on an analysis of the properties of the TSVMs presented in the literature, a novel modified TSVM classifier designed for addressing ill-posed remote-sensing problems is proposed. In particular, the proposed technique: 1) is based on a novel transductive procedure that exploits a weighting strategy for unlabeled patterns, based on a time-dependent criterion; 2) is able to mitigate the effects of suboptimal model selection (which is unavoidable in the presence of small-size training sets); and 3) can address multiclass cases.

In this paper, we present a method that combines limited manual labeling, computational linguistics and information retrieval to classify a large collection of Web search queries. A short set of manually chosen terms that are known a priori to be of interest to a particular class is used to cull a small number of actual queries from a commercial search engine log. These queries are then submitted to a commercial search engine and the returned search results are used to find more class related terms. We examine classification proficiency of the proposed method on a large Web search engine query log and show that up to 48% of the unlabeled set could be classified using this method.

Pattern discovery and visualization have become fundamental approaches to analyzing such large-scale gene expression data. From the pattern discovery perspective, clustering techniques have received great attention. However, due to the statistical nature of SAGE data {i.e., underlying distribution), traditional clustering techniques may not be suitable for SAGE data analysis. Based on the adaptation and improvement of self-organizing maps and hierarchical clustering techniques, this paper presents two new clustering algorithms, namely, PoissonS and PoissonHC, for SAGE data analysis. Tested on synthetic and experimental SAGE data, these algorithms demonstrate several advantages over traditional pattern discovery techniques. The results indicate that, by incorporating statistical properties of SAGE data, PoissonS and PoissonHC, as well as a hybrid approach (neuro-hierarchical approach) based on the combination of PoissonS and PoissonHC, offer significant improvements in pattern discovery and visualization for SAGE data. Moreover, a user-friendly platform, which may improve and accelerate SAGE data mining, was implemented.

The basic idea is to synthesize the animated faces by an interpolation based on a small set of 3D key face shapes which span a 3D face space. The 3D key shapes are extracted by an unsupervised learning process in 2D video space to form a set of 2D visemes which are then mapped to the 3D face space. The learning process consists of two main phases: 1) isomap-based nonlinear dimensionality reduction to embed the video speech movements into a low-dimensional manifold and 2) k-means clustering in the low-dimensional space to extract 2D key viseme frames. Our main contribution is that we use the isomap-based learning method to extract intrinsic geometry of the speech video space and thus to make it possible to define the 3D key viseme shapes. To do so, we need only to capture a limited number of 3D key face models by using a general 3D scanner. Moreover, we also develop a skull movement recovery method based on simple anatomical structures to enhance 3D realism in local mouth movements.

The method combines spatial and temporal information generated by the multichannel immunosensor for rapid and reliable discrimination between pathogens of interest. This paper demonstrates that by including temporal and cross-reactive spatial signatures, the accuracy of the system can be improved at low pathogen concentration levels and for discrimination between closely related strains of pathogens. Compensation of systematic and biosensor fabrication errors is achieved by the use of a supervised SVM training which is also used in system calibration.

However, very little work has been done in this area and was focusing mainly on person identification but not on person authentication. Person authentication aims to accept or to reject a person claiming an identity, i.e., comparing a biometric data to one template, while the goal of person identification is to match the biometric data against all the records in a database. We propose the use of a statistical framework based on Gaussian mixture models and maximum a posteriori model adaptation, successfully applied to speaker and face authentication, which can deal with only one training session.

We assume that valuable resources need to be protected against unauthorized users and that, to this aim, a password-based access control scheme is employed. Such an abstract scenario captures many applicative settings. The issue we focus our attention on is the following: password-based schemes provide a certain level of security as long as users choose good passwords, i.e., passwords that are hard to guess in a reasonable amount of time. In order to force the users to make good choices, a proactive password checker can be implemented as a submodule of the access control scheme. Such a checker, any time the user chooses/changes his own password, decides on the fly whether to accept or refuse the new password, depending on its guessability. Hence, the question is: how can we get an effective and efficient proactive password checker? By means of neural networks and statistical techniques, we answer the above question, developing suitable proactive password checkers. Through a series of experiments, we show that these checkers have very good performance: error rates are comparable to those of the best existing checkers, implemented on different principles and by using other methodologies, and the memory requirements are better in several cases.

Our system learns relationships between the movements of a person, the context in which they are acting, and a utility function. This learning makes explicit that the meaning of a behavior to an observer is contained in its relationship to actions and outcomes. An agent wishing to capitalize on these relationships must learn to distinguish the behaviors according to how they help the agent to maximize utility. The model we use is a partially observable Markov decision process, or POMDP. The video observations are integrated into the POMDP using a dynamic Bayesian network that creates spatial and temporal abstractions amenable to decision making at the high level. The parameters of the model are learned from training data using an a posteriori constrained optimization technique based on the expectation-maximization algorithm. The system automatically discovers classes of behaviors and determines which are important for choosing actions that optimize over the utility of possible outcomes. This type of learning obviates the need for labeled data from expert knowledge about which behaviors are significant and removes bias about what behaviors may be useful to recognize in a particular situation. We show results in three interactions: a single player imitation game, a gestural robotic control problem, and a card game played by two people.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4204157","Face and gesture recognition;clustering algorithms;control theory;dynamic programming.;machine learning;motion;parameter learning;statistical models;video analysis","Bayesian methods;Constraint optimization;Context;Decision making;Displays;Game theory;Humans;Machine learning;Training data;Uncertainty","Markov processes;belief networks;expectation-maximisation algorithm;optimisation;video signal processing","POMDP;decision theoretic models;dynamic Bayesian network;expectation-maximization algorithm;partially observable Markov decision processes;posteriori constrained optimization technique;spatial abstractions;temporal abstractions;value-directed human behavior analysis;video data;video observations","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Behavior;Decision Support Techniques;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Markov Chains;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Video Recording","16","","57","","","July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Based on Huang's constructive network model, this paper proposes a simple learning algorithm capable of real-time learning which can automatically select appropriate values of neural quantizers and analytically determine the parameters (weights and bias) of the network at one time only. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been systematically investigated on a large batch of benchmark real-world regression and classification problems. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can not only produce good generalization performance but also have real-time learning and prediction capability.

This process decides correct boundaries between words in a sentence containing spacing errors, which are a type of spelling error. Except for some Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese, most languages have explicit word spacing. In these languages, word spacing is crucial to increase readability and to accurately communicate a text's meaning.

In this paper, we present a new text categorization method that combines the distributional clustering of words and a learning logic technique, called Lsquare, for constructing text classifiers. The high dimensionality of text in a document has not been fruitful for the task of categorization, for which reason, feature clustering has been proven to be an ideal alternative to feature selection for reducing the dimensionality. We, therefore, use distributional clustering method (IB) to generate an efficient representation of documents and apply Lsquare for training text classifiers. The method was extensively tested and evaluated. The proposed method achieves higher or comparable classification accuracy and F<sub>1</sub> results compared with SVM on exact experimental settings with a small number of training documents on three benchmark data sets WebKB, 20Newsgroup, and Reuters-21578.

In this work, we extend the original EBW algorithm and derive a novel method for MCE-based model parameter estimation. Compared with conventional gradient descent methods for MCE learning, the proposed method gives a solid theoretical basis, stable convergence, and it is well suited for the large-scale batch-mode training process essential in large-scale speech recognition and other pattern recognition applications. Evaluation experiments, including model training and speech recognition, are reported on both a small vocabulary task (TI-digits) and a large vocabulary task (WSJ), where the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.

Most of the algorithms proposed in the past, for solving the VAD problem, have been based on some deterministic feature of the speech signal such as zero crossing rate. The speech/non-speech decisions are then taken using suitably chosen thresholds. This paper presents the application of support vector machines (SVM) for classifying the voice activity. The speech signal has been divided into labeled overlapping frames and pattern classification has subsequently been performed by using a supervised learning algorithm. It has been observed that the SVM based solution is computationally efficient and provides around 90% accuracy for speech signals directly recorded using a microphone and an accuracy of over 85% for noisy speech","","CD-ROM:0-7803-9733-9; POD:0-7803-9732-0","10.1109/ISPACS.2006.364896","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212283","Machine Learning;Speech Coding;Support Vector Machine;Voice Activity Detection","Automatic speech recognition;Background noise;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Speech coding;Speech enhancement;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Working environment noise","speech coding;speech recognition;support vector machines","SVM;automatic speech recognition;labeled overlapping frames;pattern classification;speech coding;supervised learning algorithm;support vector machine;voice activity classification;voice activity detection;zero crossing rate","","3","","9","","","12-15 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed approach determines automatically the optimal size of the feature set, and chooses the most relevant features from a feature pool. Its performance was tested using a lung nodule database (52 true nodules and 443 false ones) acquired by multislice CT scans. From 23 features calculated for each detected structure, the suggested method determined ten to be the optimal feature subset size, and selected the most relevant ten features. A support vector machine classifier trained with the optimal feature subset resulted in 100% sensitivity and 56.4% specificity using an independent validation set. Experiments show significant improvement achieved by a system incorporating the proposed method over a system without it.

"Universal approximation using incremental constructive feedforward networks with random hidden nodes","","","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","20060705","2006","17","4","879","892","According to conventional neural network theories, single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) with additive or radial basis function (RBF) hidden nodes are universal approximators when all the parameters of the networks are allowed adjustable. However, as observed in most neural network implementations, tuning all the parameters of the networks may cause learning complicated and inefficient, and it may be difficult to train networks with nondifferential activation functions such as threshold networks. Unlike conventional neural network theories, this paper proves in an incremental constructive method that in order to let SLFNs work as universal approximators, one may simply randomly choose hidden nodes and then only need to adjust the output weights linking the hidden layer and the output layer. In such SLFNs implementations, the activation functions for additive nodes can be any bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous functions g:R→R and the activation functions for RBF nodes can be any integrable piecewise continuous functions g:R→R and ∫<sub>R</sub>g(x)dx≠0. The proposed incremental method is efficient not only for SFLNs with continuous (including nondifferentiable) activation functions but also for SLFNs with piecewise continuous (such as threshold) activation functions. Compared to other popular methods such a new network is fully automatic and users need not intervene the learning process by manually tuning control parameters.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2006.875977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1650244","Ensemble;feedforward network;incremental extreme learning machine;radial basis function;random hidden nodes;support vector machine;threshold network;universal approximation","Artificial neural networks;Automatic control;Feedforward neural networks;Function approximation;Helium;Joining processes;Machine learning;Neural networks;Radial basis function networks;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks;transfer functions","additive nodes;bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous functions;incremental constructive feedforward networks;integrable piecewise continuous functions;neural network theories;nondifferential activation functions;radial basis function hidden nodes;random hidden nodes;single-hidden-layer feedforward networks;threshold networks;universal approximation","","236","","53","","","July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such techniques, when applied to industrial problems such as customer relationship management (CRM), are useful in pointing out customers who are likely attritors and customers who are loyal, but they require human experts to postprocess the discovered knowledge manually. Most of the postprocessing techniques have been limited to producing visualization results and interestingness ranking, but they do not directly suggest actions that would lead to an increase in the objective function such as profit. In this paper, we present novel algorithms that suggest actions to change customers from an undesired status (such as attritors) to a desired one (such as loyal) while maximizing an objective function: the expected net profit. These algorithms can discover cost-effective actions to transform customers from undesirable classes to desirable ones. The approach we take integrates data mining and decision making tightly by formulating the decision making problems directly on top of the data mining results in a postprocessing step. To improve the effectiveness of the approach, we also present an ensemble of decision trees which is shown to be more robust when the training data changes.

Consequently, a methodology for obtaining controllers of minimal size is introduced and a comparative study between supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms for the generation of successful collective behaviors is presented. We have developed a prototype simulated world for our studies. This case study is primarily a computer games inspired world but its main features are also biologically plausible.

As reported earlier, our experiments demonstrate that very high information transfer rates can be achieved using the readiness potential (RP) when predicting the laterality of upcoming left- versus right-hand movements in healthy subjects. A more recent study showed that the RP similarly accompanies phantom movements in arm amputees, but the signal strength decreases with longer loss of the limb. In a complementary approach, oscillatory features are used to discriminate imagined movements (left hand versus right hand versus foot). In a recent feedback study with six healthy subjects with no or very little experience with BCI control, three subjects achieved an information transfer rate above 35 bits per minute (bpm), and further two subjects above 24 and 15 bpm, while one subject could not achieve any BCI control.

The proposed solution involves inverting a single matrix of small dimension. In the case of linear SVRs, the size of the matrix is independent of the number of data samples. Results involving benchmark data sets demonstrate the computational advantages of the proposal. In a recent publication, it has been highlighted that the margin in support vector machines (SVMs) is not scale invariant. This implies that an appropriate scaling can have an impact on the generalization performance of the SVM based regressor. Potential SVMs address this issue and suggest a new approach to regression","2325-940X;2325940X","CD-ROM:1-4244-0370-7; POD:1-4244-0369-3","10.1109/INDCON.2006.302859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086330","Approximation methods;Function Approximation;Least Squares Methods;Machine Learning;Pattern Classification;Regression;Support Vector Machines","Function approximation;Kernel;Lagrangian functions;Least squares methods;Machine learning;Proposals;Quadratic programming;Senior members;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;matrix inversion;regression analysis;support vector machines","SVM based regressor;benchmark data sets;matrix inversion;potential SVR;regularized least squares approach;support vector machine","","0","","16","","","15-17 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
