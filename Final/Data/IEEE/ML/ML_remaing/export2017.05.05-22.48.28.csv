This swapping procedure is effective because we can create clusters without any computationally heavy matrix decomposition process to obtain a cluster label for each data.

It is therefore not possible to evaluate every wafer: commonly, a small subset of a productive lot is measured at the metrology station and delegated to represent the whole lot. Virtual Metrology (VM) methodologies aim to obtain reliable estimates of metrology results without actually performing measurement operations; this goal is usually achieved by means of statistical models, linking process data and context information to target measurements. In this paper, we tackle two of the most important issues in VM: (i) regression in high dimensional spaces where few variables are meaningful, and (ii) data heterogeneity caused by inhomogeneous production and equipment logistics.

Most existing studies focus on document-based approaches and documents are represented as bag-of word. Therefore, this feature representation fails to obtain the relation or associative information between words and it can't distinguish different opinions of a sentiment word with different targets. In this paper, we present a dependency tree-based sentence-level sentiment classification approach. In contrast to a document, a sentence just contains little information and a small set of features which can be used for the sentiment classification. So we not only capture flat features (bag-of-word), but also extract structured features from the dependency tree of a sentence. We propose a method to add more information to the dependency tree and provide an algorithm to prune dependency tree to reduce the noisy, and then introduce a convolution tree kernel-based approach to the sentence-level sentiment classification. The experimental results show that our dependency tree-based approach achieved significant improvement, particularly for implicit sentiment classification.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4475-5; POD:978-1-4577-0896-1","10.1109/SNPD.2011.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6063561","Convolution tree kernel;Dependency tree;Pruning;Sentence-level sentiment classification","Convolution;Feature extraction;Kernel;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Syntactics;Thumb","emotion recognition;feature extraction;pattern classification;text analysis;tree data structures","associative information;bag-of word representation;convolution tree kernel-based approach;dependency tree based approach;document-based approach;feature representation;implicit sentiment classification;sentence-level sentiment classification;structured feature extraction","","3","","24","","","6-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we study how to use relationships between objects to improve the performance of a ranking model. A novel ranking function is proposed, which combines the content relevance of documents with respect to queries and relation information between documents. Two types of loss functions are constructed as the targets for optimization. Then we utilize neural network and gradient descent algorithm as model and training algorithm to build ranking model.

From an initial collection of 10 melodic motifs from different musical pieces, we provided heuristic-based renditions to these melodic motifs, four for each one, and obtained a total of 50 melodic motifs. We asked 10 subjects to provide self-annotations of the affective flavor of these motifs. We then represented these motifs as first-order logic predicates and employed inductive logic programming for the CAUI to learn relations of user affect perceptions and music features. To obtain new compositions, we first used a genetic algorithm with a fitness function that is based on the induced relations for the CAUI to generate chordal tone variants. We then used probabilistic modifications for the CAUI to alter these chordal tones to become non-harmonic tones. The CAUI composed 60 new user-specific affect-based musical pieces for each subject. Our results indicate that the compositions differ significantly for only one pair of affect type when the subject evaluations of the CAUI compositions were compared using paired t-test. However, when we compared the subject evaluations of the quality of the melodies and of the musical pieces from when melodic motif variants were not considered, the improvement is significant with t-values of 5.86 and 6.33, respectively, for a significance level of 0.01.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4567-7; POD:978-1-4577-1848-9","10.1109/KSE.2011.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6063470","emotion recognition;human-computer interaction;music information retrieval","Biological cells;Convergence;Genetic algorithms;Humans;Instruments;Machine learning;Training","emotion recognition;genetic algorithms;inductive logic programming;music;probabilistic logic","CAUI;affect based music compositional artificial intelligence;chordal tone variants;constructive adaptive user interface;first order logic predicate;fitness function;genetic algorithm;heuristic based rendition;inductive logic programming;melodic motif;nonharmonic tones;paired t-test;user affect perception;user specific affect based musical piece","","0","","17","","","14-17 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such cases, it is unsuitable to only consider discrimination in the low-dimensional source latent space since this would generalize badly to target domains. In this paper, we propose a new dimensionality reduction method for transfer learning scenarios, which is called transferable discriminative dimensionality reduction (TDDR). By resolving an objective function that encourages the separation of the domain-merged data and penalizes the distance between source and target distributions, we can find a low-dimensional latent space which guarantees not only the discrimination of projected samples, but also the transferability to enable later classification or regression models constructed in the source domain to generalize well to the target domain. In the experiments, we firstly analyze the perspective of transfer learning in brain-computer interface (BCI) research and then test TDDR on two real datasets from BCI applications. The experimental results show that the TDDR method can learn a low-dimensional latent feature space where the source models can perform well in the target domain.","1082-3409;10823409","Electronic:978-0-7695-4956-7; POD:978-1-4577-2068-0","10.1109/ICTAI.2011.134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6103425","Fisher discriminant analysis;brain-computer interface;dimensionality reduction;transfer learning","Brain computer interfaces;Bridges;Conferences;Learning systems;Machine learning;Principal component analysis;Training","brain-computer interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","BCI research;TDDR method;brain-computer interface;domain-merged data separation;low-dimensional source latent space;regression models;source distributions;target distributions;transfer learning;transferable discriminative dimensionality reduction method","","5","","12","","","7-9 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of the current approaches based on port number or payload detection are becoming increasingly impractical with the appearance of dynamic or encrypted applications. Even though some supervised learning based work were proposed, it is difficult to collect sufficient flow-labeled traces for training. On the other hand, online classification needs an early identification, which is still challenging for most well-known approaches. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning based traffic classification approach named SMILER, which supports an early classification from the sizes of the first few packets (empirically 5 packets) of a flow. Experiments in real networks demonstrate that SMILER achieves 94% precision and 96% recall on average for all tested applications, even with disordered packets SMILER still works well. With a hybrid scheme, the performance is further improved. Meanwhile, SMILER performs fast in both classification and updating. All experimental results show that SMILER is practical for fast and accurate online traffic classification.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4521-9; POD:978-1-4577-1454-2","10.1109/ANCS.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062730","Quality of Service;Semi-Supervised Learning;Traffic Classification","Accuracy;Educational institutions;Machine learning;Protocols;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","SMILER;dynamic applications;encrypted applications;network traffic classification;online classification;online traffic classification;payload detection;port number detection;semi-supervised learning;supervised learning based work","","4","","27","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research uses the COD (Classifier Output Difference) distance metric for measuring how similar or different learning algorithms are. The COD quantifies the difference in output behavior between pairs of learning algorithms. We construct a distance matrix from the individual COD values, and use the matrix to show the spectrum of differences among families of learning algorithms. Results show that individual algorithms tend to cluster along family and functional lines.

While work in neuroergonomics certainly predates the use of the term in the literature (previously identified by others as applied neuroscience, operational neuroscience, etc.), there is great promise in the larger framework that is represented by the general context of the terminology. Here, we focus on the very specific concept that principles in brain-computer interfaces, neural prosthetics and the larger realm of machine learning using physiological inputs can be applied directly to the design and implementation of augmented human-machine systems. Indeed, work in this area has been ongoing for more than 25 years with very little cross-talk and collaboration between clinical and applied researchers. We propose that, given increased interest in augmented human-machine systems based on cognitive state, further progress will require research in the same vein as that being done in the aforementioned communities, and that all researchers with a vested interest in physiologically-based machine learning techniques can benefit from increased collaboration. We thereby seek to describe the current state of cognitive state assessment in human-machine systems, the problems and challenges faced, and the tightly-coupled relationship with other research areas.

In order to accomplish this, the underlying assumptions of each trading system are explored, and data is created in order to evaluate the efficacy of these systems when trading on data with the underlying patterns that they expect. The strategies are tested against a buy-and-hold strategy to determine if the act of trading has actually produced any worthwhile results, or are simply facets of the underlying prices. These results are then used to produce targeted returns based upon either a desired return or a desired risk, as both are required within the portfolio-management industry.

This paper details some investigations of a novel PD pulse diagnosis method which obviates the need for power frequency synchronization, using an automated classifier trained on laboratory- generated PD pulse data, specifically intended for operation within the resource constraints of a wireless sensor node. Comparative results from a number of machine learning techniques and training parameters demonstrate that the defect classification accuracy can be optimised to 82% based upon the training data used.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0809-1; POD:978-1-4577-0807-7","10.1109/ISAP.2011.6082224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6082224","","Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring;Partial discharges;Testing;Training;Wireless sensor networks","fault diagnosis;partial discharges;power system measurement","asynchronous diagnosis;automated classifier;electrical system;machine learning techniques;monitoring systems;partial discharge defects;partial discharge monitoring;partial discharge pulse diagnosis method;phase-resolved partial discharge diagnostics;power frequency synchronization;power line connection;wireless sensor network technology;wireless sensor node","","0","","29","","","25-28 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rather than merely apply the standard machine learning framework to this task, we seek to acquire a better ODC classification system by integrating experts' ODC experience and domain knowledge into the learning process via proposing a novel Relevance Annotation Framework. We evaluated AutoODC on an industrial defect report from the social network domain.

The use of feature selection techniques for large-scale text categorization task is desired for improving the accuracy and efficiency. χ<sup>2</sup> statistic and simplified χ<sup>2</sup> are two effective feature selection methods in text categorization. Using these two feature selection criteria, for a term, one needs to compute the local scores of the term over each category and usually takes the maximum or average value of these scores as the global term-goodness criterion. But there is no explicit explanation on how to choose maximum or average; moreover, these two operations can not reflect the degree of scatter of a term over all categories. In this paper, we propose a new global feature evaluation criterion based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for choosing informative terms since KL divergence is a widely used method to measure the differences of distributions between two categories. We conduct experiments on Reuters-21578 corpus with k-NN classifier to test the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that this method enhances the performance of text categorization.

To address this problem, we introduce performance metrics that bridge the gap from handwritten strokes to spatial structure. Our metrics are computed using bipartite graphs that represent classification, segmentation and spatial structure at the stroke level. Overall correctness of an expression is measured by counting the number of relabelings of nodes and edges needed to make the bipartite graph for a recognition result match the bipartite graph for ground truth.

As a result, many machine learning techniques are still limited to being used in situations where safety and robustness are not critical for success. One way to overcome this difficulty is by using reachability analysis, which can be used to compute regions of the state space, known as reachable sets, from which the system can be guaranteed to remain safe over some time horizon regardless of the disturbances. In this paper we show how reachability analysis can be combined with machine learning in a scenario in which an aerial robot is attempting to learn the dynamics of a ground vehicle using a camera with a limited field of view. The resulting simulation data shows that by combining these two paradigms, one can create robotic systems that feature the best qualities of each, namely high performance and guaranteed safety.","2153-0858;21530858","DVD:978-1-61284-455-8; Electronic:978-1-61284-456-5; POD:978-1-61284-454-1","10.1109/IROS.2011.6095101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095101","","Machine learning;Observers;Reachability analysis;Robots;Safety;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","","","","4","","23","","","25-30 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, this paper proposes a new variable precision rough set based decision tree algorithm (IVPRSDT). This algorithm uses a new standard of attribute selection which considers comprehensively the classification accuracy and number of attribute values, that is, weighted roughness and complexity. At the same time support and confidence are introduced in the conditions of the corresponding node to stop splitting, and they can improve the algorithm's generalization ability.

However, these bots work via simple routines pre-programmed to suit the game map, game rules, game type, and other parameters unique to each game. Mostly, illusive intelligent behaviors are programmed using simple conditional statements and are hard-coded in the bots' logic. Moreover, a game programmer has to spend considerable time configuring crisp inputs for these conditional statements. Therefore, we realize a need for machine learning techniques to dynamically improve bots' behavior and save precious computer programmers' man-hours. We selected Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to evolve dynamic intelligent bots, as it is a simple, efficient, and online learning algorithm. Machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning are known to be intractable if they use a detailed model of the world, and also require tuning of various parameters to give satisfactory performance.

G-PARE provides several different views which allow users to obtain a global overview of the algorithms output, as well as focused views that show subsets of nodes of interest. By providing an adaptive exploration environment, G-PARE guides the users to places in the graph where two algorithms predictions agree and places where they disagree.

However, drift effect is a major limitation of HITS algorithm. In this paper, a new approach HAP-Growth (Hub-Averaging Pattern-Growth) has been proposed for WARM without pre-assigned weights.

The conclusion of our experiments is that the codebook representation performs better than the primitive feature representation.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1481-8; POD:978-1-4577-1479-5","10.1109/ICCP.2011.6047884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6047884","","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Histograms;Humans;Machine learning algorithms;Shape;Training","Haar transforms;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;traffic engineering computing","AdaBoost;bag of words model;classical Haar features;classical HoG features;codebook features;content based image retrieval;discriminative recognition approach;image annotation techniques;object recognition;oriented gradients;pedestrian detection methods;two dimensional image extraction","","3","","18","","","25-27 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"R-EVO: A Reactive Evolutionary Algorithm for the Maximum Clique Problem","M. Brunato; R. Battiti","Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","20111128","2011","15","6","770","782","An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) has been proposed recently for solving the maximum clique problem. In the framework of estimation-of-distribution algorithms, guided mutation uses a model distribution to generate offspring by combining the local information of solutions found so far with global statistical information. Each individual is then subjected to a Marchiori's repair heuristic, based on randomized extraction and greedy expansion, to ensure that it represents a legal clique. A novel reactive and evolutionary algorithm (R-EVO) proposed in this paper starts from the same evolutionary framework but considers more complex individuals, which modify tentative solutions by local search with memory, according to the reactive search optimization (RSO) principles. In particular, the estimated distribution is used to periodically initialize the state of each individual based on the previous statistical knowledge extracted from the population. We demonstrate that the combination of the estimation-of-distribution concept with RSO produces significantly better results than EA/G for many test instances and it is remarkably robust with respect to the setting of the algorithm parameters. R-EVO adopts a drastically simplified low-knowledge version of reactive local search (RLS), with a simple internal diversification mechanism based on tabu-search, with a prohibition parameter proportional to the estimated best clique size. R-EVO is competitive with the more complex full-knowledge RLS-EVO that adopts the original RLS algorithm. For most of the benchmark instances, the hybrid scheme version produces significantly better results than EA/G for comparable or a smaller central processing unit time.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2010.2043363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6025278","Estimation of distribution;guided mutation;maximum clique;reactive search optimization","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Evolutionary computation;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Maintenance engineering;Optimization","evolutionary computation;search problems;statistical analysis","Marchiori repair heuristic;R-EVO;estimation-of-distribution concept;global statistical information;greedy expansion;guided mutation;maximum clique problem;randomized extraction;reactive evolutionary algorithm;reactive local search;reactive search optimization principles","","8","","33","","20110923","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We use the frequency domain as a feature space. The low frequency part of the Fourier phase spectrum of a blurred image remains almost unaffected by blur. This means that phases corresponding to the lowest frequencies can be used as features for classification. MLMVN is the most suitable machine learning tool for solving the problem, since it uses phases as inputs. MLMVN is based on multi-valued neurons whose inputs and output are located on the unit circle and therefore they are determined exactly by phases. This determines a very important ability of MLMVN and MVN to treat phases properly We employ in this paper a slightly modified learning MLMVN rule and a modified learning strategy, which extends margins between classes' representatives used for the learning and the borders of classes. This approach makes it possible to classify with 100% accuracy even such heavily blurred textures where visual analysis and classification are not possible at all.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4244-9637-2; POD:978-1-4244-9635-8","10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033378","","Backpropagation;Biological neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Frequency domain analysis;Machine learning;Neurons;Nonhomogeneous media","image classification;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons","Fourier phase spectrum;blurred texture classification;feature space;frequency domain;learning strategy;machine learning;multilayer neural network;multivalued neurons","","4","","21","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 5 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To the best of our knowledge, for the first time ever RELIEF is used in this paper as RELIEF-C for unlabeled data to select relevant features for clustering. We modified RELIEF so as to overcome its inherent difficulties in the presence of large number of irrelevant features and/or significant number of noisy tuples. RELIEF-C has several advantages over existing wrapper and filter feature selection methods: (a) it works well in the presence of large amount of noisy tuples, (b) it is robust even when underlying clustering algorithm fails to cluster properly, and (c) it accurately recognizes the relevant features even in the presence of large number of irrelevant features.

It is the combination of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm and a system that creates hierarchy of goals. The goal creation system is concerned with creating new internal goals, building a hierarchy of them, and controlling the agent's behavior according to this constituted hierarchy of goals. As in case of reinforcement learning method, a motivated learning agent is learning through interaction with the environment. The comparisons of both methods in special type test environment show that the motivated learning method is more efficient in learning complex relations between available resources (concepts). ML has better performance than RL, especially in dynamically changing environments. In the presented experiments we have shown that ML based agent, which has the ability to set its internal goals autonomously, is able to fulfill the designer's goals more effectively than RL based agent. In addition, because the observed concepts are not predefined but emerge during the learning process, this method also addresses problem of merging connectionist and symbolic approaches for intelligent autonomous systems.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4244-9637-2; POD:978-1-4244-9635-8","10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033276","autonomous systems;hierarchical problem decomposition;intelligent agents;intrinsic motivation;motivated learning;reinforcement learning","Availability;Learning;Learning systems;Machine learning;Pain;Radiation detectors;Switches","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile agents;mobile computing","ML based agent;RL based agent;agent behavior;biologically inspired machine learning method;complex relation;goal creation system;intelligent autonomous system;learning agent;motivated learning agent;motivated learning process;reinforcement learning algorithm;symbolic approach","","2","","22","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 5 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But while such organization is a natural process for humans, quantifying it empirically proves to be a very difficult task, and as such no dominant feature representation for music emotion recognition has yet emerged. Much of the difficulty in developing emotion-based features is the ambiguity of the ground-truth. Even using the smallest time window, opinions on the emotion are bound to vary and reflect some disagreement between listeners. In previous work, we have modeled human response labels to music in the arousal-valence (A-V) representation of affect as a time-varying, stochastic distribution. Current methods for automatic detection of emotion in music seek performance increases by combining several feature domains (e.g. loudness, timbre, harmony, rhythm). Such work has focused largely in dimensionality reduction for minor classification performance gains, but has provided little insight into the relationship between audio and emotional associations. In this new work we seek to employ regression-based deep belief networks to learn features directly from magnitude spectra. While the system is applied to the specific problem of music emotion recognition, it could be easily applied to any regression-based audio feature learning problem.","1931-1168;19311168","Electronic:978-1-4577-0693-6; POD:978-1-4577-0692-9; USB:978-1-4577-0691-2","10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6082328","Emotion recognition;deep belief networks;feature learning;regression","Emotion recognition;Humans;Machine learning;Music;Topology;Training","audio signal processing;belief networks;emotion recognition;music","acoustic features;audio feature learning problem;expression of emotions;learning emotion;magnitude spectra;music emotion recognition;regression based deep belief networks","","13","","12","","","16-19 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose to tackle this problem by adopting ensemble learning in feature space.

The generated kernels are plugged into decision tree based learners to conduct similarity based learning and finally we combine all learners with a majority voting strategy.

In the past few years, a new line of machine learning research has been developed to overcome such awkward situations, called Domain Adaptation (DA), giving rise to many adaptation algorithms and theoretical results in the form of generalization bounds. In this paper, a novel contribution is proposed in the form of a DA algorithm dealing with string-structured data, inspired from the DA support vector machine (SVM) technique introduced in [Bruzzone et al, PAMI 2010]. To ensure the convergence of SVM-based learning, the similarity functions involved in the process must be valid kernels, i.e. positive semi-definite (PSD) and symmetric. However, in the string-based context that we are considering in this paper, this condition is often not satisfied. Indeed, it has been proven that most string similarity functions based on the edit distance are not PSD. To overcome this drawback, we make use in this paper of the new theory of learning with good similarity functions introduced by Balcan et al., which (i) does not require the use of a valid kernel to learn well and (ii) allows us to induce sparser models. We take advantage of this theoretical framework to propose a new DA algorithm using good edit similarity functions. Using a suitable string-representation of handwritten digits, we show that are our new algorithm is very efficient to deal with the scaling and rotation problems usually encountered in image classification.","1082-3409;10823409","Electronic:978-0-7695-4956-7; POD:978-1-4577-2068-0","10.1109/ICTAI.2011.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6103325","Domain Adaptation;Edit Distance;Sparse Learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Kernel;Machine learning;Particle separators;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors","handwritten character recognition;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","DA algorithm;SVM-based learning;domain adaptation;good edit similarities;handwritten digit string-representation;image classification;machine learning research;rotation problem;scaling problem;sparser models;string similarity functions;string-based context;support vector machine technique;target test problem","","0","","19","","","7-9 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These threats include many system-level failures whose causes are difficult and time-consuming to determine. It is difficult to detect vulnerabilities to these failures prior to deployment of an application into production and applications are currently not well-equipped to handle them effectively. This results in lengthy downtimes of production systems and hence low availability. The goal of this PhD is to increase the availability of such systems by eliminating as many failures as possible before deployment and by assisting administrators to diagnose their causes more efficiently.

In order to use the history of observations in the action selection, the rules of observation sequences and their values are defined. In the proposed method, the deterministic policy can be learn finally by considering the history of observations if needed. We carried out a series of computer experiments, and confirmed that the proposed method can detect the states in perceptual aliasing in the POMDPs environment, and can obtain the deterministic policy using the values for the rules of observation sequences.","1062-922X;1062922X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0653-0; POD:978-1-4577-0652-3","10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6083713","","Computers;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;History;Learning;Machine learning algorithms;Markov processes","Markov processes;learning (artificial intelligence)","POMDP environment;action selection;deterministic policy;observation sequences;partially observable Markov decision process;perceptual aliasing;profit sharing","","2","","7","","","9-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we extend the applicability of regularization path algorithm to a class of learning machines that have quadratic loss and quadratic penalty term. This class contains several important learning machines such as squared hinge loss support vector machine (SVM) and modified Huber loss SVM. We first show that the solution paths of this class of learning machines have piecewise nonlinear form, and piecewise segments between two breakpoints are characterized by a class of rational functions. Then we develop an algorithm that can efficiently follow the piecewise nonlinear path by solving these rational equations. To solve these rational equations, we use rational approximation technique with quadratic convergence rate, and thus, our algorithm can follow the nonlinear path much more precisely than existing approaches such as predictor-corrector type nonlinear-path approximation.

A generalized constraint neural network-LPs (GCNN-LPs) model is studied. Unlike other existing modeling approaches, the GCNN-LP model exhibits its advantages. First, any LP is embedded by an explicitly structural mode, which may add a higher degree of transparency than using a pure algorithm mode. Second, a direct elimination and least squares approach is adopted to study the model, which produces better performances in both accuracy and computational cost over the Lagrange multiplier techniques in experiments. Specific attention is paid to both “hard (strictly satisfied)” and “soft (weakly satisfied)” constraints for regression problems. Numerical investigations are made on synthetic examples as well as on the real-world datasets.

Thus there are many variations to help HIP. Text-based CAPTCHA is the most common method, where each user is asked to discern the hidden characters in noisy-images. Many image-based HIP were recently proposed and tested to overcome the weakness of text-based HIP. Though the image-based HIP problem is harder to solve compared to a conventional text-based puzzle, some powerful machine learning tools, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), can easily break this problem. The authors have previously developed an image orientation-based CAPTCHA problem with polygonally cropped sub-images. In this paper, we address the more fundamental issue: what is the most important feature for a human to recognize the correct orientation of a partial image. We insist that the box-counting measure for an arbitrary polygon, which was already been devised to measure fractal objects, is a successful metric to measure the human perception of partial image orientation. This means that it is - easy for human to get the orientation of the high-box counted polygonal sub-image, but very hard for any machine learning tool due to the partialness of subject images. We also insist that a special polygon which has a high box-counting value, is a fractal shape, so an effective partial image for HIP is an empirically random fractal polygon. We found that irregularly recurring fractal polygons defeat SVM attack to decrease random attack accuracy.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4388-8; POD:978-1-4577-0383-6","10.1109/CIT.2011.93","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6036769","CAPTCHA;arbitrary polygon;fractal polygon;regular polygon","Fractals;Humans;Image recognition;Machine learning;Semantics;Shape;Support vector machines","Web services;computational geometry;fractals;human computer interaction;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;text analysis;theorem proving","Web services;arbitrary polygon image;automated software tools;box-counting measure;box-counting value;fractal polygon image;human interactive proof system;image orientation-based CAPTCHA problem;image-based HIP;machine learning tools;support vector machine;text-based CAPTCHA;text-based HIP;text-based puzzle","","0","","20","","","Aug. 31 2011-Sept. 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key artifact consists of working with a representation of the compatible parameters in terms of random variables without priors.

Different from most of example-based algorithms, the information of test patches is considered during learning local regression functions which map a low-resolution patch to a high-resolution patch. Localization strategy is generally adopted in single-image super-resolution with nearest neighbor-based algorithms. However, the poor generalization of the nearest neighbor estimation decreases the performance of such algorithms. Though the problem can be fixed by local regression algorithms, the sizes of local training sets are always too small to improve the performance of nearest neighbor-based algorithms significantly. To overcome the difficulty, the semi-supervised regression algorithm is used here. Unlike supervised regression, the information about test samples is considered in semi-supervised regression algorithms, which makes the semi-supervised regression more powerful. Noticing that numerous test patches exist, the performance of nearest neighbor-based algorithms can be further improved by employing a semi-supervised regression algorithm.

We explore a solution to this challenge in the context of atrial fibrillation (AF) detection. Using patient recordings from the MIT-BIH AF database, we demonstrate the importance of patient specificity and present a scalable method of constructing a personalized detector based on active learning. Using a generic detector having a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 57% as its seed, our active learning approach constructs a detector with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 85%. This performance approaches that of a patient-specific detector, which has a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 85%.

We introduce here this issue of sample-dependent feature selection, which has not been addressed before as far as we know. We propose a method to tackle this problem, that can be generalized to any classifier that provides a confidence score along with its prediction. Empirical results using AdaBoost on three mail classification problems show that our approach allows to significantly improve classification efficiency (up to 40% CPU time off) without significant loss of accuracy in comparison to the baseline.","1520-5363;15205363","Electronic:978-07695-4520-2; POD:978-1-4577-1350-7","10.1109/ICDAR.2011.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065325","Image document classification;confidence-rated multi-label classification;feature selection","Accuracy;Calibration;Databases;Error analysis;Estimation;Feature extraction;Machine learning","document image processing;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","AdaBoost;automatic text transcription;document image categorization;document image classification;pixel-level features;sample-dependent feature selection","","0","","13","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The focus here is on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which is a data driven method and able to provide part-based representation of data. A new constrained optimization problem is proposed for the purpose of BOLD detection. The proposed constraint imposes some prior spatial information of active area inside the brain, on the decomposition process. The constraint is built up based on the type of stimulus and available physiological knowledge of the brain performance. The simulation results on both synthetic and real fMRI data show that applying the proposed constraint improves the BOLD detection performance.","1094-687X;1094687X","Electronic:978-1-4577-1589-1; POD:978-1-4244-4121-1; USB:978-1-4244-4122-8","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6091251","","Correlation;Machine learning algorithms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Matrix decomposition;Signal processing algorithms;Signal to noise ratio","biomedical MRI;brain;data handling;matrix decomposition;medical image processing;optimisation","BOLD detection;brain;constrained optimization problem;data driven method;decomposition process;nonnegative matrix factorization;part-based data representation;physiological knowledge;spatially constrained NMF;synthetic fMRI data","Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","0","","15","","","Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a new tool called DANAK has been developed for the detection of anomalies in Netflow records by referring to spatial and temporal information aggregation in combination with Machine Learning techniques. Spatially aggregated Netflow records are fed in a new designed kernel function in order to analyze Netflow records on context and quantitative information. To strengthen the analysis of large volumes of Netflow records, Phase Space Embedding and Machine Learning are applied. The proposed method has been validated by extensive experimentation on real data sets, including numerous attack strategies of different roots.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0460-4; POD:978-1-4577-0458-1","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059996","","Fires;IP networks;Kernel;Machine learning;Measurement;Monitoring;Security","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;telecommunication traffic","DANAK;anomaly detection;detecting anomalies in netflow records by spatial aggregation and kernel method;machine learning techniques;network monitoring;network security;phase space embedding;spatial information aggregation;temporal information aggregation;traffic classification","","4","","29","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
