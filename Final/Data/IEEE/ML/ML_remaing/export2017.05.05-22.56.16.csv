Each client desires a minimum overall service success probability, which is achieved by establishing multiple independent connections with multiple servers. Given the service success probability of each potential client-server connection, our problem is to assign the connections such that the number of satisfied clients (whose overall service success probability is met) is maximized subject to server capacity constraints. In this paper, we make minor adaptations to the well-known notion of probabilistic network from the machine learning community and use it as our communication model. We then formally define the above optimization problem as the link assignment for successful service problem (LASS). While LASS can be reduced to the maximum matching problem in the deterministic case (where the success probabilities of each edge is 1), we show that in the probabilistic case it is NP-hard (and MaxSNP-hard). An equivalent integer programming formulation for LASS is obtained so that for small input size, the problem may be efficiently solved by the standard IP solver in practice. To tackle large input size, various heuristics are designed. Furthermore, in the special case where the underlying network graph is a tree (which is common in many real-life settings), we show that LASS can be solved in linear time based on a simple greedy algorithm. Experimental evaluations are performed and the results demonstrate the practicality of the algorithms and the heuristics.","2155-5486;21555486","Electronic:978-1-4244-7151-5; POD:978-1-4244-7150-8","10.1109/SECON.2010.5508251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508251","","Capacity planning;Communications Society;Computer networks;Computer science;Error correction;Interference;Linear programming;Machine learning;Network servers;USA Councils","client-server systems;computational complexity;graph theory;greedy algorithms;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;wireless channels","IP solver;MaxSNP-hard;NP-hard;client-server connection;greedy algorithm;integer programming formulation;link assignment;machine learning;matching problem;network graph;optimization problem;probabilistic network;service enhancement;successful service problem;wireless environment;wireless network channels","","1","","19","","","21-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results are promising, but it is unclear if the obtained classifier could be used on the data from another sensor. As it would be a huge inconvenience having to train a classifier for every sensor (setup), we set out to find if, and when is a classifier trained on one sensor setup transferable to another sensor setup. We tested two sensors in five different setups. In total, we acquired 2455 range scans. Experiments showed that the classifier trained on noisier sensor data performed better at classification of data coming from other sensor setups. Classifiers trained on less noisy data were shown to be overconfident, and performed poorly on noisy data. Furthermore, experiments showed that classifiers learned on ten times smaller datasets performed as good as classifiers trained on larger datasets. Since AdaBoost is a supervised learning technique, obtaining same classifier efficiency with significantly smaller dataset means less hand labeling of the data for the same results.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6886-7; POD:978-1-4244-6885-0","10.1109/RAAD.2010.5524573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5524573","2D range;AdaBoost;Hokuyo;SICK;legs","Boosting;Control engineering computing;Leg;Legged locomotion;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile robots;Object detection;Robot sensing systems;Thumb","feature extraction;image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;noise;object detection;path planning;pattern classification;robot vision;sensor fusion;target tracking","2D range data;AdaBoost algorithm;data classification;leg detection;mobile robot;moving object tracking;noisier sensor data;noisy data;sensor setup;supervised machine learning technique","","1","","11","","","24-26 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we describe a human detection method that augments widely used edge-based features with texture and color information, providing us with a much richer descriptor set. This augmentation results in an extremely high-dimensional feature space (more than 170,000 dimensions). In such high-dimensional spaces, classical machine learning algorithms such as SVMs are nearly intractable with respect to training. Furthermore, the number of training samples is much smaller than the dimensionality of the feature space, by at least an order of magnitude. Finally, the extraction of features from a densely sampled grid structure leads to a high degree of multicollinearity. To circumvent these data characteristics, we employ Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis, an efficient dimensionality reduction technique, one which preserves significant discriminative information, to project the data onto a much lower dimensional subspace (20 dimensions, reduced from the original 170,000). Our human detection system, employing PLS analysis over the enriched descriptor set, is shown to outperform state-of-the-art techniques on three varied datasets including the popular INRIA pedestrian dataset, the low-resolution gray-scale DaimlerChrysler pedestrian dataset, and the ETHZ pedestrian dataset consisting of full-length videos of crowded scenes.","1550-5499;15505499","Electronic:978-1-4244-4419-9; POD:978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459205","","Data mining;Feature extraction;Gray-scale;Humans;Image edge detection;Information analysis;Layout;Least squares methods;Machine learning algorithms;Videos","","","","181","2","28","","","Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike other types of algorithms for attribute-distributed learning that directly refit the ensemble residual or average among the predictions of the agents, the new algorithm, the iterative covariance optimization algorithm (ICOA), coordinates the agents to reshape the covariance matrix of the individual training residuals so that the ensemble estimator, a linear combination of the individual estimators, minimizes the ensemble training error. Moreover, ICOA empirically demonstrates strong insusceptibility to overtraining, especially compared with residual refitting algorithms. Extensive simulations on both artificial and real datasets indicate that ICOA consistently outperforms weighted averaging algorithms and residual refitting algorithms.","0743-1619;07431619","Electronic:978-1-4244-7427-1; POD:978-1-4244-7426-4","10.1109/ACC.2010.5531627","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5531627","","Bandwidth;Control systems;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Distributed computing;Iterative algorithms;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Multivariate regression;Voting","covariance matrices;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;optimisation;regression analysis","ICOA;attribute-distributed learning;covariance matrix;fusion center;iterative covariance optimization algorithm;multivariate regression;residual refitting algorithm","","0","","12","","","June 30 2010-July 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Jensen-Bregman divergences extend the well-known Jensen-Shannon divergence by allowing to choose an arbitrary convex function generator instead of the standard Shannon entropy. This class of Jensen-Bregman divergences notably includes the squared Euclidean distance. Although Jensen-Bregman divergences are symmetric distances by construction, they are not metrics as they violate the triangle inequality. We study the geometric properties and combinatorial complexities of both the Voronoi diagrams and the centroidal Voronoi diagrams induced by such as class of information-theoretic divergences. We show that those Jensen-Bregman divergences appear naturally into two contexts: (1) when symmetrizing Bregman divergences, and (2) when computing the Bhattacharyya distances of statistical distributions. The Bhattacharyya distance measures the amount of overlap of distributions, and is popularly used to provide both lower and upper bounds in machine learning: the Bayes' misclassification error. Since the Bhattacharyya distance of popular distributions in statistics called the exponential families (including familiar Gaussian, Poisson, multinomial, Beta/Gamma families, etc.) can be computed equivalently as Jensen-Bregman divergences, the Jensen-Bregman Voronoi diagrams allow one also to study statistical Voronoi diagrams induced by an entropic function.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7605-3; POD:978-1-4244-7606-0","10.1109/ISVD.2010.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521410","$alpha$-divergence;$f$-divergence;Bhattacharyya distance;Bregman divergences;Burbea-Rao divergence;Hellinger-Kakutani-Matusita divergences;Jensen difference;Jensen's inequality;Jensen-Shannon divergence;exponential families;information geometry","Computer science;Computer vision;Distortion measurement;Distributed computing;Entropy;Euclidean distance;Laboratories;Machine learning;Signal generators;Statistical distributions","Bayes methods;computational geometry;convex programming;exponential distribution;learning (artificial intelligence)","Bayes misclassification;Bhattacharyya distance measurement;Jensen-Bregman Voronoi diagram;Jensen-Bregman divergence;centroidal tessellation;combinatorial complexity;convex function;entropic function;exponential family;information theoretic divergence;machine learning;squared Euclidean distance;statistical distribution","","2","","28","","","28-30 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the set of important attributes, the Bagging method was used to generate sub-SVMs and then the majority voting rule was adopted to obtain the final ensemble result of all sub-SVMs. The proposed ensemble method can avoid destructing the attribute relativity or attribute dependence by selecting an attribute subset from original attribute space randomly. The performance of single SVM can be improved and the diversity between sub-SVMs can also be guaranteed.

To address the task of detecting, localizing, and labeling the buttons, we use state-of-the-art vision algorithms along with machine learning techniques to take advantage of contextual features. To verify our approach, we collected a dataset of 150 pictures of elevator panels from more than 60 distinct elevators, and performed extensive offline testing. On this very diverse dataset, our algorithm succeeded in correctly localizing and labeling 86.2% of the buttons. Using a mobile robot platform, we then validate our algorithms in experiments where, using only its on-board sensors, the robot autonomously interprets the panel and presses the appropriate button in elevators never seen before by the robot.

A decision learning tree is constructed from the evolutionary relationships (or bipartitions) found in the evolutionary trees returned from a phylogenetic analysis. We treat evolutionary trees returned from multiple runs of a phylogenetic analysis as different classes. Then, we use the depth of a decision tree as a technique to measure how distinct the runs are from each other. Decision trees with shallow depth reflect non-convergence since the evolutionary trees can be classified with little information. Deep decision tree depths reflect convergence. We study Bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses consisting of thousands of trees. For some datasets studied here, a single distinguishing bipartition can classify the entire tree collection suggesting non-convergence of the underlying phylogenetic analysis. Thus, we believe that decision trees lead to new insights with the potential for helping biologists reconstruct more robust evolutionary trees.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6768-6; POD:978-1-4244-6766-2","10.1109/CIBCB.2010.5510326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510326","","Bayesian methods;Classification tree analysis;Computational intelligence;Convergence;Decision trees;Heuristic algorithms;Inference algorithms;Machine learning;Phylogeny;Sampling methods","bioinformatics;convergence;decision trees;evolution (biological);genetics;learning (artificial intelligence)","Bayesian phylogenetic analyses;bipartitions;convergence property;decision learning tree;decision trees;evolutionary relationships;maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses;phylogenetic analysis","","1","","22","","","2-5 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a hetero-oligomer, its type will be identified among the following six categories: (1) heterodimer, (2) heterotrimer, (3) heterotetramer, (4) heteropentamer, (5) heterohexamer, (6) heterooctamer. Using machine learning approach, the Fuzzy Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (FKNN), we developed a prediction system for protein quaternary structural type in which we incorporated functional domain composition (FunD) and pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAA).

Experimental approaches to identify microRNAs are expensive and time-consuming. Computational approaches have proven to be useful for identifying microRNA candidates. Most approaches rely on features extracted from miroRNA precursors (pre-microRNA) and their secondary structure. Selecting the appropriate set of features plays a critical role in improving the prediction accuracy of pre-microRNA candidates. This work aims to investigate the triplet elements encoding scheme and to identify essential features needed for the correct classification of pre-microRNAs. To achieve these goals, an extension of the triplet elements encoding scheme is introduced. Features extracted using the extended scheme were combined with global features introduced in the literature, and fuzzy decision tree (FDT) is used as a classification and a feature selection tool. Unlike previous machine-learning-based approaches, FDT produces a human comprehensible classification model. The interpretability of the classification model provides a means to identify the essential features needed to recognize microRNA candidates and offers a better understanding of this problem. Our results indicate that the triplet elements scheme is not superior to any of its proposed extensions. Further analysis revealed that including the features extracted using triplet elements scheme does not add any value to this classification problem but rather introduces some noisy features, and comparable classification results can be achieved by using only the six global features identified by FDT.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6768-6; POD:978-1-4244-6766-2","10.1109/CIBCB.2010.5510430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510430","","Biological information theory;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Diseases;Encoding;Feature extraction;Machine learning;RNA;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","decision trees;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;macromolecules;medical image processing;organic compounds;pattern classification","feature extraction;fuzzy decision trees;microRNAs precursors classification;post-transcriptional gene regulation;pre-microRNA;triplet elements encoding scheme","","0","","35","","","2-5 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The obvious enticement is that the robot should be able to improve its own behavior without the need for detailed step-by-step programming. However, for RL to reach its full potential, the algorithms must be sample efficient: they must learn competent behavior from very few real-world trials. From this perspective, model-based methods, which use experiential data more efficiently than model-free approaches, are appealing. But they often require exhaustive exploration to learn an accurate model of the domain. In this paper, we present an algorithm, Reinforcement Learning with Decision Trees (RL-DT), that uses decision trees to learn the model by generalizing the relative effect of actions across states. The agent explores the environment until it believes it has a reasonable policy. The combination of the learning approach with the targeted exploration policy enables fast learning of the model. We compare RL-DT against standard model-free and model-based learning methods, and demonstrate its effectiveness on an Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot scoring goals in a penalty kick scenario.","1050-4729;10504729","Electronic:978-1-4244-5040-4; POD:978-1-4244-5038-1","10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509181","","Computer science;Decision making;Decision trees;Helicopters;Humanoid robots;Learning systems;Machine learning;Robot programming;Robotics and automation;USA Councils","decision making;decision trees;generalisation (artificial intelligence);humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-robot systems","Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot;autonomous robot;decision making;decision trees;generalized model learning;reinforcement learning;robot programming","","17","","14","","","3-7 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal is to classify test data with minimum error probability, based on the training data available for the classes. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) is the optimal decision rule when the distributions are known. Hence, a popular approach for classification is to estimate the likelihoods using well known probability estimators, e.g., the Laplace and Good-Turing estimators, and use them in a LRT. We are primarily interested in situations where the alphabet of the underlying distributions is large compared to the training data available, which is indeed the case in most practical applications. We motivate and propose LRT's based on pattern probability estimators that are known to achieve low redundancy for universal compression of large alphabet sources. While a complete proof for optimality of these decision rules is warranted, we demonstrate their performance and compare it with other well-known classifiers by various experiments on synthetic data and real data for text classification.","2157-8095;21578095","Electronic:978-1-4244-7892-7; POD:978-1-4244-7890-3; USB:978-1-4244-7891-0","10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5513570","","Error probability;Information theory;Light rail systems;Machine learning;Optical character recognition software;Probability distribution;Redundancy;Testing;Text categorization;Training data","data compression;error statistics;pattern classification;statistical distributions;text analysis","Laplace estimators;good-Turing estimators;large alphabet source universal compression;likelihood ratio test;minimum error probability;optimal decision rule;pattern probability estimators;probability distributions;text classification","","1","","11","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Fooling Functions of Halfspaces under Product Distributions","P. Gopalan; R. O'Donnell; Y. Wu; D. Zuckerman","Microsoft Res.

This class includes not only familiar cases such as the uniform distribution on the discrete cube, the uniform distribution on the solid cube, and the multivariate Gaussian distribution, but also includes any product of discrete distributions with probabilities bounded away from 0. Our first main result shows that a recent pseudorandom generator construction of Meka and Zuckerman , when suitably modified, can fool arbitrary functions of d halfspaces under product distributions where each coordinate has bounded fourth moment. To e-fool any size-s, depth-d decision tree of halfspaces, our pseudorandom generator uses seed length O((dlog(ds/∈) + log n)·log(ds/∈)). For monotone functions of d halfspaces, the seed length can be improved to O((dlog(d/∈) + logn) · log(d/∈)). We get better bounds for larger e; for example, to l/polylog(n)-fool all monotone functions of (log n)l log log n halfspaces, our generator requires a seed of length just O(logn). Our second main result generalizes the work of Diakonikolas et al. to show that bounded independence suffices to fool functions of halfspaces under product distributions. Assuming each coordinate satisfies a certain stronger moment condition, we show that any function computable by a size-s, depth-d decision tree of halfspaces is e-fooled by Õ(d<sup>4</sup>s<sup>2</sup>/∈<sup>2</sup>)-wise independence. Our technical contributions include: a new multidimensional version of the classical Berry-Esseen theorem; a derandomization thereof; a generalization of Servedio's regularity lemma for halfspaces which works under any product distribution with bounded fourth moments; an extension of this regularity lemma to functions of many halfspaces; and, new analysis of the sandwiching polynomials technique of Bazzi for arbitrary pro- - duct distributions.","1093-0159;10930159","Electronic:978-1-4244-7215-4; POD:978-1-4244-7214-7","10.1109/CCC.2010.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497884","Pseudorandness;complexity theory;halfspace","Circuits;Computational complexity;Computer science;Decision trees;Gaussian distribution;Machine learning;Neural networks;Polynomials;Solids;Static VAr compensators","Gaussian distribution;decision trees;polynomials","decision tree;fooling functions;monotone functions;multivariate Gaussian distribution;polynomials technique;product distributions;pseudorandom generators","","6","","32","","","9-12 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the uneven distribution and the soft margin of the classifier, the algorithm tries to improve the general accuracy of classifying a dataset, and in this process it might misclassify a lot of weakly represented classes, confusing their class instances as overshoot values that appear in the dataset, and thus ignoring them. This paper introduces the Enhancer, a new algorithm that improves the Cost-sensitive classification for Support Vector Machines, by multiplying in the training step the instances of the underrepresented classes.

The navigation task requires identifying safe, traversable paths that allow the robot to progress towards a goal while avoiding obstacles. Machine learning techniques are well adapted to this task, accomplishing near-to-far learning by training appearance-based models using near-field stereo readings in order to predict safe terrain and obstacles in the far field. However, these methods are subject to degraded performance when training data sets exhibit class imbalance, or skew, where data instances of one class outnumber those in another. In such scenarios, classifiers can be overwhelmed by the majority class, and will tend to ignore the minority class. In this paper, we show that typical outdoor terrain scenarios are associated with training data imbalance, and examine the impact of using undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, and biased penalties techniques to correct for imbalance in stereo-derived training data. We conduct a statistically significant, repeated measures empirical evaluation and demonstrate improved far-field terrain prediction performance when using such methods for handling class imbalance versus taking no corrective action at all.","1050-4729;10504729","Electronic:978-1-4244-5040-4; POD:978-1-4244-5038-1","10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509634","","Cameras;Degradation;Layout;Machine learning;Navigation;Predictive models;Robot vision systems;Robotics and automation;Training data;USA Councils","collision avoidance;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;robot vision;stereo image processing","appearance based model;autonomous outdoor robot navigation;biased penalties technique;class imbalance handling;far field terrain prediction performance;imbalanced training data;machine learning technique;near field stereo reading;near-to-far learning;stereo derived training data;unstructured outdoor environment","","2","","35","","","3-7 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, defining suitable covariance functions that are able to appropriately model complex space-time dependencies in the environment is a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a generic approach for constructing several classes of covariance functions for spatio-temporal GP modeling.

We present an approach to estimate the interference between nodes and links in a live wireless network by passive monitoring of wireless traffic. This does not require any controlled experiments, injection of probe traffic in the network, or even access to the network nodes. Our approach requires deploying multiple sniffers across the network to capture wireless traffic traces. These traces are then analyzed to infer the interference relations between nodes and links. We model the 802.11 MAC as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and use a machine learning approach to learn the state transition probabilities in this model using the observed trace. This coupled with an estimation of collision probabilities helps us to deduce the interference relationships. We show the effectiveness of this method against simpler heuristics, and also a profiling-based method that requires active measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly more accurate than heuristics and quite competitive with active measurements. We also validate the approach in a real WLAN environment.","2155-5486;21555486","Electronic:978-1-4244-7151-5; POD:978-1-4244-7150-8","10.1109/SECON.2010.5508290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508290","","Communication system traffic control;Degradation;Hidden Markov models;Interference;Machine learning;Monitoring;Probes;Traffic control;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","access protocols;hidden Markov models;interference (signal);learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","802.11 MAC;802.11 wireless networks;WiFi networks;collision probabilities;hidden Markov model;interference relation deconstruction;machine learning;profiling-based method;state transition probabilities;wireless interference;wireless traffic monitoring","","7","","23","","","21-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our experimental study based on a domain centered corpus shows that a consistent performance improvement can be achieved when concept-centered phrases are included in addition to the single term based features in document representations.

Thus, the development of new methods for a large-scale analysis/annotation of protein functional residues is inevitable. Currently existing methods are not capable to do so due to the lack of automation, availability, and/or poor performance. In our previous work we were able to improve the accuracy of the prediction to ~86%, although the number of false-positives remained high. In this paper we present a fully-automated method for the prediction of catalytic residues in proteins that improves accuracy by reduction of false-positives, and is applicable for a large-scale analysis. Here, catalytic residues are predicted by machine learning approach followed by hierarchical analysis of the predicted residues. The capability of the method was tested on diverse family of hydrolytic enzymes with a/b hydrolase fold with widely differing phylogenetic origins and catalytic functions. The method was executed manually and then fully reproduces automatically. In the manual analysis, in 17 enzymes, the method correctly predicted all 3 residues of the catalytic triad with 3 false-positives out of 282 residues on average. Our method successfully eliminates the number of false-positives, while being applicable for a large-scale analysis of the protein function.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7495-0; POD:978-1-4244-7494-3","10.1109/BIBE.2010.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521686","CoP;catalytic residue;conservation of prediction;large-scale analysis;machine leaning;prediction;protein function","Accuracy;Automation;Availability;Biochemistry;Bioinformatics;Genomics;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Protein engineering;Testing","biochemistry;biological techniques;biology computing;catalysis;enzymes;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;proteins","a-b hydrolase fold;biochemical function;biophysical function;catalytic residues;catalytic triad;consensus-of-prediction approach;diverse family;fully-automated method;genome-sequencing era;hierarchical analysis;hydrolytic enzymes;large-scale analysis;machine learning approach;phylogenetic origins;protein annotation;protein functional residues;protein structure initiative","","0","","22","","","May 31 2010-June 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective is to construct a reality-based haptic interaction system for knowledge transfer by linking an expert's skill with robotic movement in real time. The benefits from this approach include 1) a representation of an expert's knowledge into a more compact and general form by learning from a minimized set of training samples, and 2) an increase in the capability of a novice user by coupling learned skills absorbed by a robotic system with haptic feedback. In order to evaluate our ideas and present the effectiveness of our paradigm, human handwriting is selected as our experiment of interest. For the learning algorithms, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) are utilized and their performances are compared. For the evaluation of the performance of the output of the learning modules, a modified Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) algorithm is implemented. Results show that one or two experts' samples are sufficient for the generation of haptic training knowledge, which can successfully recreate manipulation motion with a robotic system and transfer haptic forces to an untrained user with a haptic device.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the efficiency of different classification methods to recognize the emotional state of a speaker with features obtained by a constraint version of the Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (CMLLR). For our experiments we adopted the multi-modal AvID database of emotions, which comprises 1708 samples of utterances each lasting at least 15 seconds. The database was randomly divided into a training set and a testing set in a ratio of 5:1. Since there are much more samples in the database belonging to the neutral class than to the aroused class, the latter was over-sampled to ensure that both classes in contained equal numbers of samples in the training set. The build-in WEKA classifiers were divided into five groups based on their theoretical foundation, i.e., the group of classifiers related to the Bayes's theorem, the group of distance-based classifiers, the group of discriminant classifiers, the group of neural networks, and finally the group of decision tree classifiers.

An example is to predict the toxicity of chemical compounds using their structural properties as features represented by graphs. A popular method to classify these graphs is to exploit classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs) and graph kernels to incorporate the sequential, structural and chemical information. Previous works have focused on designing specific graph kernels for this task, amongst which graph alignment kernels are one of the most popular approach. Graph alignment kernels align the nodes of one graph to the nodes of the second graph so that the total overall similarity is maximized with respect to all possible alignments. However, taking both vertex and edge similarities into account makes the problem NP-Hard. In this paper, we present a novel general graph-matching based method for QSAR. We view the problem of calculating optimal assignments of two attributed graphs from a different perspective. Instead of first designing an atom kernel function and a bond kernel function, we first provide a training set of pairs of graphs with their corresponding matchings. We then try to learn the compatibility function over atoms and use only the atom kernel function to compute graph matchings. Our algorithm has the advantage of being more general and yet efficient than previous approaches for the QSAR problem. We evaluate our method on a set of chemical structure-activity prediction benchmark datasets, and show that our algorithm can achieve better or comparable accuracies over the optimal assignment kernel method.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6768-6; POD:978-1-4244-6766-2","10.1109/CIBCB.2010.5510690","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510690","","Biology computing;Chemical compounds;Decision trees;Drugs;Kernel;Logistics;Machine learning algorithms;Regression tree analysis;Support vector machines;Training data","chemistry computing;graph theory;pattern classification;support vector machines","NP-hard problem;atom kernel function;attributed molecular graph classification;bond kernel function;chemical activity prediction;chemical information;graph alignment kernels;graph-matching;quantitative structure-activity relationship;sequential information;structural information;support vector machines","","0","","45","","","2-5 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach represents an action as a sequence of prototypes for efficient and flexible action matching in long video sequences. During training, first, an action prototype tree is learned in a joint shape and motion space via hierarchical k-means clustering; then a lookup table of prototype-to-prototype distances is generated. During testing, based on a joint likelihood model of the actor location and action prototype, the actor is tracked while a frame-to-prototype correspondence is established by maximizing the joint likelihood, which is efficiently performed by searching the learned prototype tree; then actions are recognized using dynamic prototype sequence matching. Distance matrices used for sequence matching are rapidly obtained by look-up table indexing, which is an order of magnitude faster than brute-force computation of frame-to-frame distances. Our approach enables robust action matching in very challenging situations (such as moving cameras, dynamic backgrounds) and allows automatic alignment of action sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves recognition rates of 91.07% on a large gesture dataset (with dynamic backgrounds), 100% on the Weizmann action dataset and 95.77% on the KTH action dataset.","1550-5499;15505499","Electronic:978-1-4244-4419-9; POD:978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459184","","Airplanes;Boosting;Face detection;Image resolution;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine learning;Object recognition;Prototypes;Training data;Uncertainty","","","","59","","32","","","Sept. 29 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

K-means is a classic clustering algorithm, but it cannot be used to find subspace clusters. In this paper, an algorithm called GKM is designed to generalize k-means algorithm for high dimensional data. In the objective function of GKM, we associate a weight vector with each cluster to indicate which dimensions are relevant to this cluster. To prevent the value of the objective function from decreasing because of the elimination of dimensions, virtual dimensions are added to the objective function. The values of data points on virtual dimensions are set artificially to ensure that the objective function is minimized when the real subspace clusters or the clusters in original space are found. Algorithm GKM preserves the advantages of k-means. It can identify subspace clusters with linear time complexity. Our performance study with a synthetic dataset and a real dataset demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of GKM.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6813-3; POD:978-1-4244-6812-6","10.1109/CSO.2010.119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5533167","data mining;high dimensions;k-means;projected clustering","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intelligent transportation systems;Iterative algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Space technology;Sun","data mining;pattern clustering","generalize k-means algorithm;k-means clustering;objective function;projected clustering algorithm;virtual dimensions;weight vector","","0","","11","","","28-31 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Learning is achieved using an on-policy temporal difference learning agent framework. The agent controls the movements of the robot by choosing torques for each joint and immediately receives a feedback signal. The implemented SARSA-agent uses an update rule that calculates the estimate of the current state-action by using the current state-action value, the received reward and the following state-action value. To handle the high number of state-action value pairs, a hash-table is used to efficiently store and access these values inside the lookup-table. To accelerate the learning process of more complex motions, a new second layer approach is introduced. In this approach, a library of simple motions is created in the first layer. The second layer-agent then combines the gathered experiences to achieve a faster solution for more complex motions. The evaluation of the two-layer agent shows that the combination of both layers dramatically increases the speed of finding a solution. Additionally, its solution is often better than the solution found by the pure reinforcement learning agent.","1948-3449;19483449","Electronic:978-1-4244-5196-8; POD:978-1-4244-5195-1","10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524384","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5524384","","Acceleration;Automatic control;Automation;Control systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Manipulators;Robots;State estimation;Torque control","control engineering computing;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;motion control;nonlinear control systems;table lookup;torque control","2DOF manipulator control;SARSA-agent;complex motions;feedback signal;hash-table;lookup-table;machine learning;motion control;nonlinear robot demonstrator;on-policy temporal difference learning agent;robot movements controls;state-action value;torques;two-layer reinforcement learning approach","","1","","15","","","9-11 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, collecting the samples requires tedious manual effort which is expensive in time and prone to error. In this paper we present design and implementation of a software system which addresses these problems.

By addressing the multi-copy issue known as the intra-heterogeneity, this paper restores the focus in using the 16S rRNA marker. Through use of a novel learning and model building algorithm, the multiple gene copies are integrated into a compact complex signature using the Extensible Markov Model (EMM). The method clusters related sequence segments while preserving their inherent order to create an EMM signature for a microbial organism. A library of EMM signatures is generated from which samples are drawn for phylogenetic analysis. By matching the components of two signatures, referred to as quasi-alignment, the differences are highlighted and scored. Scoring quasi-alignments is done using adapted Karlin-Altschul statistics to compute a novel distance metric. The metric satisfies conditions of identity, symmetry, triangular inequality and the four point rule required for a valid evolution distance metric. The resulting distance matrix is input to PHYologeny Inference Package (PHYLIP) to generate phylogenies using neighbor joining algorithms. Through control of clustering in signature creation, the diversity of similar organisms and their placement in the phylogeny is explained. The experiments include analysis of genus Burkholderia, a random microbial sample spanning several phyla and a diverse sample that includes RNA of Eukaryotic origin. The NCBI sequence data for 16S rRNA is used for validation.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6768-6; POD:978-1-4244-6766-2","10.1109/CIBCB.2010.5510472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510472","","Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Genomics;Libraries;Machine learning;Organisms;Phylogeny;RNA;Statistics;Taxonomy","Markov processes;bioinformatics;directed graphs;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics","16S rRNA marker;EMM signature;Karlin-Altschul statistics;PHYLIP;PHYologeny Inference Package;Phylogenetic tree analysis;consistent phylogenetic tree;distance matrix;extensible Markov model;genus Burkholderia;microbial organism;model building algorithm;molecular sequences;multiple gene copies;neighbor joining algorithms;sequence transformation","","0","","32","","","2-5 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, reliable detection and localization using non-adaptive samples is possible only if the feature strength grows logarithmically in the problem dimension. Here it is shown that using adaptive sampling, reliable detection is possible provided the feature strength exceeds a constant, and localization is possible when the feature strength exceeds any (arbitrarily slowly) growing function of the problem dimension.","2157-8095;21578095","Electronic:978-1-4244-7892-7; POD:978-1-4244-7890-3; USB:978-1-4244-7891-0","10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513489","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5513489","","Additive white noise;Extraterrestrial measurements;Gaussian noise;Machine learning;Noise measurement;Sampling methods;Signal analysis;Signal detection;Signal sampling;Testing","Gaussian noise;signal detection;signal sampling;white noise","adaptive measurements;adaptive sampling;distilled sensing;signal detection;signal localization;sparse recovery;white Gaussian noise","","5","","20","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
