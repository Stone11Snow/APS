Of particular interest are enzymes, which process information in highly complex dynamic environments. Exploring the information processing characteristics of an enzyme by selectively altering its environment may lead to the discovery of new modes of computation. The physical experiments required to perform such exploration are combinatorial in nature. Thus resource consumption, both time and money, poses major limiting factors on any exploratory work. New tools are required to mitigate these factors. One such tool is lab-on-chip based autonomous experimentation system, where a microfluidic experimentation platform is driven by machine learning algorithms. The lab-on-chip approach provides an automated platform that can perform complex protocols, which is also capable of reducing the resource cost of experimentation. The machine learning algorithms provide intelligent experiment selection that reduces the number of experiments required for discovery.

"Integration of Learning Classifier Systems with simultaneous localisation and mapping for autonomous robotics","H. Williams; W. N. Browne","School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand","2012 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","20120802","2012","","","1","8","A cognitive mobile robot must be able to autonomously solve the three complex problems of navigating: where it is, where it is going and how it is going to get there. The first is addressed by techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The next stage of navigating is to plan a path to a goal, which is often achieved by learning techniques due to the scale of search required. Commonly, the localisation and mapping stage is separated from path planning stage, with the function not of interest being considered ideal in order to simplify the problem (similarly, the goal is often predetermined by an external agent, such as a human operator specifying a location to reach). This work integrates the planning with the localisation and mapping in order to investigate the benefits of considering these aspects together (rather than as a separate functions as is often assumed). Firstly, experiments on real-robots show decreased localisation error in this approach (1.8 mm ±0.41 mm to 1.2 mm ±0.26 mm). Secondly, the number of steps to goal has concurrently been reduced (13.4 steps to 11.8 steps). This work is novel in the integration of evolutionary computation planning techniques with SLAM. It also has enabled the opportunity for rule-sharing between heterogeneous robots and the inclusion of action policies in SLAM filter updates.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1509-8; POD:978-1-4673-1510-4","10.1109/CEC.2012.6256571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6256571","","Feature extraction;Machine learning;Mobile robots;Navigation;Simultaneous localization and mapping","SLAM (robots);cognitive systems;evolutionary computation;filtering theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;path planning;robot vision","SLAM filter updates;action policies;autonomous robotics;cognitive mobile robot;evolutionary computation planning techniques;heterogeneous robots;learning classifier systems;learning techniques;path planning stage;rule-sharing;simultaneous localisation-and- mapping","","1","","32","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Former classifiers deemed as usable by the hypothesis test mechanism and the new classifiers are integrated to form the final classifiers ensemble for prediction. The main focus of the work is to identify the usability of base classifiers that representing the same or similar concept with the current one, make full use of the older valid information together with the newer examples to improve classification accuracy, and avoid the interference of classifiers representing conflictive concepts with the current one.

For example, by considering video classification as a MIL problem where we only need labeled video clips (such as tagged online videos) but not labeled video frames, one can lower down the labeling cost, which is typically very expensive. We propose a novel class specific distance Metrics enhanced Class-to-Bag distance (M-C2B) method to learn a robust and discriminative distance for multi-instance data, which employs the not-squared ℓ<sub>2</sub>-norm distance to address the most difficult challenge in MIL, i.e., the outlier instances that abound in multi-instance data by nature. As a result, the formulated objective ends up to be a simultaneous ℓ<sub>2, 1</sub>-norm minimization and maximization (minmax) problem, which is very hard to solve in general due to the non-smoothness of the ℓ<sub>2, 1</sub>-norm. We thus present an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the general ℓ<sub>2, 1</sub>-norm minmax problem with rigorously proved convergence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to solve a general ℓ<sub>2, 1</sub>-norm minmax problem in literature.

"Learning feature hierarchies under reinforcement","A.

Established techniques are able to build deep hierarchies using neural networks, such as deep learning based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, however approaches using other machine learning techniques involving reinforcement are not well established. An approach is presented that uses a form of Learning Classifier System to build a hierarchical feature network, for classification of images using the MNIST dataset. Larger scale representations of rules are composed of re-used smaller elements, in a network of 4,000 features and 2,000 rules. The feature network is developed autonomously, according to reinforcement of rules the features participate in. An implementation is shown using the ARCS classifier system to perform classification of images, using rules based on image templates. A second implementation uses rules with image templates constructed from a hierarchical feature network. This shows effective classification performance, but not as accurate as the best neural network and kernel methods. The implementation shows the ability to construct a hierarchical feature network under reinforcement, and its application to develop a rule population used by a Learning Classifier System. An alternative method for modifying existing rules is shown to substitute for standard mutation and crossover processes, to allow exploration of the rule space more closely related to gradient descent and cognitively related processes, rather than the genetic analogy commonly used in learning classifier systems.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1509-8; POD:978-1-4673-1510-4","10.1109/CEC.2012.6256569","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6256569","","Accuracy;Buildings;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Neural networks;Training","Boltzmann machines;feature extraction;gradient methods;image classification;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition","ARCS classifier system;MNIST dataset;cognitively related processes;genetic analogy;gradient descent processes;hierarchical feature network;human visual system;image classification;image templates;large scale rule representations;learning classifier system;machine learning techniques;neural networks;object classification;object recognition;reinforcement learning feature hierarchies;restricted Boltzmann machines;reused features","","1","","27","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One potential remedy to this problem is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), in which typically the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array containing all t-way configuration option combinations. However, in a prior study we showed that several programs have important high-strength interactions (combinations of a subset of configuration options) that CIT is highly unlikely to generate in practice. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree) that aims to identify sets of configurations to test that are smaller than those generated by CIT, while also including important high-strength interactions missed by practical applications of CIT. On each iteration of iTree, we first use low-strength CIT to test the program under a set of configurations, and then apply machine learning techniques to discover new interactions that are potentially responsible for any new coverage seen. By repeating this process, iTree builds up a set of configurations likely to contain key high-strength interactions. We evaluated iTree by comparing the coverage it achieves versus covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets. Our results strongly suggest that iTree can identify high-coverage sets of configurations more effectively than traditional CIT or random sampling.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-4673-1067-3; POD:978-1-4673-1066-6","10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227129","Empirical Software Engineering;Software Configurations;Software Testing and Analysis","Arrays;Clustering algorithms;Decision trees;Instruments;Machine learning;Software engineering;Testing","combinatorial mathematics;learning (artificial intelligence);program testing","CIT;combinatorial interaction testing;efficiently discovering high coverage configurations;high strength interactions;iTree;interaction tree discovery;machine learning techniques;potential remedy;software configurability","","5","","37","","","2-9 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An optimizer component decides, whether applying these changes makes sense economically (i.e., whether the costs of violating the SLAs are bigger than the adaptation costs).

From the results of this experiment, we demonstrate that the proposed system for the learning of invariants based on spatio-temporal continuity can be used as a compelling unsupervised method for learning invariants from an input that includes temporal information.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4673-1490-9; POD:978-1-4673-1488-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252788","Invariant learning;Learning and adaptation;Machine vision;Unsupervised learning","Accuracy;Head;Machine learning;Robustness;Streaming media;Training;Vectors","computer vision;face recognition;unsupervised learning;video signal processing","computational neuroscience;face rotational movement;invariant discovery;invariant learning;machine learning;machine vision;single video input;spatio-temporal continuity;spatio-temporal invariant feature;spatio-temporal relationship;spatio-temporally invariant representation;temporal information;unsupervised learning","","0","","21","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to address these shortcomings, we developed UsiGesture, an engineering method and a software support platform that accommodates multiple algorithms for pen-based gesture recognition in order to integrate them in a straightforward way into interactive computing systems. The method is aimed at providing designers and developers with support for the following steps: defining a dataset that is appropriate for an interactive system (e.g., made of commands, symbols, characters), determining the most suitable gesture recognition algorithm depending on contextual variables (e.g., user, platform, environment), fine-tuning the parameters of this algorithm by multi-criteria optimization (e.g., system speed and recognition rate vs. human distinguishability and perception), and incorporation of the fine-tuned algorithm in an integrated development environment for engineering interactive systems.","2151-1349;21511349","Electronic:978-1-4577-1938-7; POD:978-1-4577-1936-3; USB:978-1-4577-1937-0","10.1109/RCIS.2012.6240449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240449","Gesture recognition;pen-based interaction;user interface modeling Introduction","Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Gesture recognition;Machine learning algorithms;Shape;Training;User interfaces","gesture recognition;light pens;optimisation;software tools;user interface management systems","UsiGesture;contextual variables;engineering interactive systems;interactive computing systems;multicriteria optimization;parameter fine-tuning;pen-based gesture recognition;pen-based interaction;software support platform;user interface development","","1","","33","","","16-18 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To ensure acceptable levels of software quality Open source software (OSS) development process uses advanced and effective techniques. Quality improvement involves the detection of potential relationship between defect and open source software metrics. Many companies are investing in open source projects for making effective software. But, because open source software is often developed with a different management style and groups of people than the industrial ones, the quality and reliability of the code needs to be investigated. Hence, more projects need to be measured to obtain information about the characteristics and nature of the source code. This paper presents an empirical study of the fault prediction capabilities of object-oriented metrics given by Chidamber and Kemerer. We have carried out an empirical study and tried to find whether these metrics are significantly associated with faults or not. For this we have extracted source code processed it for metrics and associated it with the bugs.

While applying DoG scale-space features for object detection/classification, we face two inevitable issues: dealing with high-dimensional data and selecting/weighting of proper scales. The scale selection process is mostly ad-hoc to present. In this paper, we propose a multiple kernel learning (MKL) method for both DoG scale selection/weighting and dealing with high-dimensional scale-space data. We design a novel shift invariant kernel function for DoG scale-space. To select only the useful scales in the DoG scale-space, a novel framework of MKL is also proposed. We utilize a 1-norm support vector machine (SVM) in the MKL optimization problem for sparse weighting of scales from DoG scale-space. The optimized data-dependent kernel accommodates only a few scales that are most discriminatory according to the large margin principle. With a 2-norm SVM, this learned kernel is applied to a challenging detection problem in oil sand mining: to detect large lumps in oil sand videos. We tested our method on several challenging oil sand data sets. Our method yields encouraging results on these difficult-to-process images and compares favorably against other popular multiple kernel methods.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2192130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6175953","1-norm support vector machine (SVM);circular convolution;difference of Gaussian (DoG) scale-space;multiple kernel learning (MKL)","Convolution;Feature extraction;Kernel;Machine learning;Object detection;Support vector machines;Videos","Gaussian processes;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);mining;object detection;oil sands;support vector machines;video signal processing","1-norm support vector machine;2-norm SVM;DoG scale-space;MKL method;MKL optimization problem;difference of Gaussians scale-sapce;difficult-to-process images;high-dimensional scale-space data;learned kernel;multiple kernel learning approach;object classification;object detection;oil sand data sets;oil sand mining;oil sand videos;optimized data-dependent kernel;proper scale selection;propoer scale weighting;scale selection process;shift invariant kernel function;sparse weighting","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Normal Distribution;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","15","","25","","20120403","Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By pairing machine learning algorithms with rigorous safety analyses, such as Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) reachability, this limitation can be overcome. Guaranteed Safe Online Learning via Reachability (GSOLR) is a framework which combines HJI reachability with general machine learning techniques, allowing for the design of robotic systems which demonstrate both high performance and guaranteed safety. In this paper we show how the GSOLR framework can be applied to a target tracking problem, in which an observing quadrotor helicopter must keep a target ground vehicle with unknown (but bounded) dynamics inside its field of view at all times, while simultaneously attempting to build a motion model of the target. The resulting algorithm was implemented on board the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control, and was compared to a naive safety-only algorithm and a learning-only algorithm. Experimental results illustrate the success of the GSOLR algorithm, even under scenarios in which the machine learning algorithm performed poorly (and would otherwise lead to unsafe actions), thus demonstrating the power of this technique.","1050-4729;10504729","Electronic:978-1-4673-1405-3; POD:978-1-4673-1403-9; USB:978-1-4673-1404-6","10.1109/ICRA.2012.6225136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225136","","Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Noise measurement;Observers;Robots;Safety;Target tracking","aerospace robotics;aircraft control;helicopters;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-robot systems;reachability analysis;statistical analysis;target tracking","GSOLR algorithm;HJI reachability;Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs reachability;Stanford testbed;autonomous rotorcraft;autonomous systems;general machine learning techniques;ground target tracking;guaranteed safe online learning-via-reachability;learning-only algorithm;motion model;multiagent control;quadrotor helicopter;robotic systems;safety analyses;safety-only algorithm;statistical learning techniques","","10","","24","","","14-18 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

General speaking, it is difficult to improve the correct proportion of the one-class classification because of few data. How to distinguish the target objects correctly from unknown samples becomes one of the most important problems. The support vector data description (SVDD) is a method proposed to solve the problem of one-class classification. It models a hyper sphere around the target set, and by the introduction of kernel functions, more flexible descriptions are obtained. In SVDD, the width parameter and the penalty parameter have to be given beforehand by the user. To automatically optimize the values for these parameters, the error on both the target and outlier data has to be estimated. Because no outlier examples are available, we propose a max-min range method for generating artificial outliers in this paper. By generating artificial outliers around the target set, the accuracy of classifiers will improve. At the last, we use four benchmark data sets: Iris, Wine, Balance-scale, and Ionosphere data base to validate the approach in this research indeed has better classification result.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4738-1; POD:978-1-4673-2033-7","10.1109/CMCSN.2012.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6245825","Support Vector Data Description (SVDD);one-class classification","Educational institutions;Error analysis;Machine learning;Standards;Support vector machines;Training","minimax techniques;pattern classification;support vector machines","SVDD;artificial outlier;balance-scale database;benchmark data set;error estimation;hypersphere;ionosphere database;iris database;kernel function;max-min range method;one-class classification method;penalty parameter;support vector data description;target object;width parameter;wine database","","1","","10","","","7-9 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study was to identify the optimal emotion recognition algorithm for classification of seven emotional states (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, and stress) using physiological signals. 12 college students participated in this experiment over 10 times. To induce each emotion, 10 emotional stimuli sets which had been tested their suitability and effectiveness, were used in experiment. Physiological signals, i.e. EDA, ECG, PPG, and SKT were acquired by MP100 Biopac system Inc. (USA) and AcqKnowledge (Ver. 3.8.1) software was used for analysis of the signals. Physiological signals were obtained prior to present emotional stimuli and while emotional stimuli were presented to participants. 28 features were extracted the acquired signals and analyzed for 30 seconds from the baseline and the emotional state. For emotion recognition, data subtracting baseline values from the emotional state applied to 5 machine learning algorithm, i.e. FLD, CART, SOM, Naïve Bayes and SVM. The result showed that an accuracy of emotion classification by SVM was 99.04% (which is the highest accuracy among used algorithms) and 30.14% by FLD (which is the lowest). This means that SVM is the optimal emotion recognition algorithm by data of this study. Our result can help emotion recognition studies lead to better chance to recognize not only basic emotion but also user's various emotions, e.g., boredom, frustration, love, pain, etc., by using physiological signals.

The new method is lightweight, and suitable for energy constrained platforms such as ultra-low power embedded systems for use in identification and authentication applications. The proposed protocol does not follow the classic paradigm of exposing the full PUF responses (or a transformation of the full string of responses) on the communication channel. Instead, random subsets of the responses are revealed and sent for authentication. The response patterns are used for authenticating the prover device with a very high probability. We perform a thorough analysis of the method's resiliency to various attacks which guides adjustment of our protocol parameters for an efficient and secure implementation. We demonstrate that Slender PUF protocol, if carefully designed, will be resilient against all known machine learning attacks. In addition, it has the great advantage of an inbuilt PUF error tolerance. Thus, Slender PUF protocol is lightweight and does not require costly additional error correction, fuzzy extractors, and hash modules suggested in most previously known PUF-based robust authentication techniques. The low overhead and practicality of the protocol are confirmed by a set of hardware implementation and evaluations.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4740-4; POD:978-1-4673-2157-0","10.1109/SPW.2012.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227682","PUF;Pattern;Physical Unclonable Function;Substring;authentication;lightweight;matching;protocol;security","Authentication;Delay;Error correction;Hamming distance;Machine learning;Protocols","cryptographic protocols;message authentication","PUF error tolerance;authentication application;energy constrained platform;fuzzy extractor;hash module;identification application;lightweight authentication;machine learning attack;random subsets;response pattern;robust authentication;secure authentication;slender PUF protocol;strong physical unclonable function;substring matching;ultra-low power embedded system","","25","","27","","","24-25 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The MKL methods generally focus on determining key kernels to be preserved and their significance in optimal kernel combination. Unfortunately, computational demand of finding the optimal combination is prohibitive when the number of training samples and kernels increase rapidly, particularly for hyperspectral remote sensing data. In this paper, we address the MKL for classification in hyperspectral images by extracting the most variation from the space spanned by multiple kernels and propose a representative MKL (RMKL) algorithm. The core idea embedded in the algorithm is to determine the kernels to be preserved and their weights according to statistical significance instead of time-consuming search for optimal kernel combination. The noticeable merits of RMKL consist that it greatly reduces the computational load for searching optimal combination of basis kernels and has no limitation from strict selection of basis kernels like most MKL algorithms do; meanwhile, RMKL keeps excellent properties of MKL in terms of both good classification accuracy and interpretability. Experiments are conducted on different real hyperspectral data, and the corresponding experimental results show that RMKL algorithm provides the best performances to date among several the state-of-the-art algorithms while demonstrating satisfactory computational efficiency.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2176341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133331","Classification;convex optimization;hyperspectral images;multiple kernel learning (MKL);support vector machine (SVM)","Hyperspectral imaging;Kernel;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;spectral analysis;support vector machines","computational efficiency;hyperspectral data;hyperspectral imagery;hyperspectral remote sensing data;image classification;interpretability;kernel preservation;kernel-based learning machine;optimal kernel combination;representative multiple kernel learning;statistical significance;support vector machine;training samples","","51","","53","","20120117","July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

C-Loss is a non-convex loss function based on a similarity measure called correntropy and is known to closely approximate the ideal 0-1 loss function for classification. This paper shows via experimental results that, by replacing the cost function - Mean Square Error (MSE) in a conventional kernel based functional mapping, by a non-convex loss function C-Loss, a non-overfitting, and hence, a better classifier can be obtained.

In this paper, we propose a novel model called COB (core, outlier, and boundary) to quantitatively measure the accuracies of majority voting ensembles for binary classification. In this model, we first divide data items into three subsets, core, outlier, and boundary, based on the prediction correctness of these items from individual classifiers in an ensemble method. Then we measure the accuracy of the ensemble method for each subset and combine the results together. We tested the performance of the COB model on 32 datasets from the UCI repository. The experiments use three different ensemble methods (bagging, random forests, and a randomized ensemble), two different numbers of individual classifiers (7 and 51), and three different individual machine learning algorithms (decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines). All 24 experiments showed less than 5% average absolute errors for 32 datasets between the accuracies by the COB model and the actual accuracies of ensembles. Also the experiments showed that the COB model performed significantly better than the binomial model. The COB model suggests that to achieve a high accuracy for an ensemble method, weak individual classifiers should be partly diverse instead of fully diverse, that is, be diverse on correctly predicted items but in agreement on some incorrectly predicted items.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4673-1490-9; POD:978-1-4673-1488-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252724","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252724","accuracy;ensemble methods;majority voting;measurement","Accuracy;Bagging;Decision trees;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Support vector machines","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","bagging;binary classification;decision trees;diverse individual classifiers;ensemble methods;k-nearest neighbors;machine learning;majority voting ensembles;prediction correctness;random forests;randomized ensemble;support vector machines","","1","","17","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a new approach to the autonomous agent problem using the multitask learning scheme based on Genetic Network Programming (GNP), called ML-GNP, where each GNP is used to learn one corresponding task. ML-GNP has some charateristics, such as distribution, interaction and autonomy, which are helpful for learning multitask problems.

In recent years, some researchers have shown that ensemble of some learners instead of all individual learners could get better performances. However, how to select individual learners as diverse as possible is a very important issue. In this paper, a new diversity measure is proposed to achieve a better selection of individual learners. Different from the commonly used diversity measures, it makes full of the data distribution information provided by the cheap and abundant unlabeled data rather than the expensive and scarce labeled data in order to obtain the higher classification accuracy. The selection method based on the new diversity measure is simple in computation and independent of models.

An exponential grid search and a 10-fold cross validation algorithm was used to determine the best (C,γ) pair. To evaluate multiple (C,γ) pairs for each binary classifier with the same best correct classification rate, four scenarios of C and γ were explored (min C min γ, min C max γ, max C min γ and max C max γ). Each experiment used the radial basis function (RBF) kernel for training, and the results were obtained on 23 real world datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results show that the pa-SVM approach mostly outperforms the standard approach and by selecting the max C min γ scenario the number of support vectors is minimized.

It employs a combined random-greedy walk of particles, with competition and cooperation mechanisms, to propagate class labels to the whole network. Due to the competition mechanism, the proposed model has a local label spreading fashion, i.e., each particle only visits a portion of nodes potentially belonging to it, while it is not allowed to visit those nodes definitely occupied by particles of other classes. In this way, a &#x201C;divide-and-conquer&#x201D; effect is naturally embedded in the model.

In this proof-of-concept work, we propose a new framework for learning in a non-stationary environment that provides only unlabeled data after the initial time step, to which we refer to as initially labeled environment. The proposed framework generates labels for previously unlabeled data at each time step to be combined with incoming unlabeled data - possibly from a drifting distribution - using a compacted polytope sample extraction algorithm.

Given a set of training data, a randomized tree can be used to perform data partition (divide-and-conquer); after a tree is built, a number of bases are learned from the data within each leaf node for a sparse representation (subspace learning via sparse coding); multiple trees with diversities are trained (ensemble), and the collection of bases of these trees constitute the codebook. These three concepts in our codebook learning algorithm have the same target but with different emphasis: subspace learning via sparse coding makes a compact representation, and reduces the information loss; the divide-and-conquer process efficiently obtains the local data clusters; an ensemble of diverse trees provides additional robustness.

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality.

This leads to antibodies with more representativeness and thus decreases the amount of prototypes generated at the end of the algorithm.

However, it lacks sparsity and thus cannot be used for feature selection. Zero norm SVM is ideal in the sense of sparsity while its optimization is prohibitive due to the combinatorial nature of zero norm. In this paper, 1 norm and infinite norm constraints are employed simultaneously to relax the zero norm while keep its sparsity. The resulted constraint regions possess much more sparse vertices than that of the 1 norm. Generally, the more sparse vertices the constraint regions have, the sparser the solution will be. Therefore, more parsimonious model can be obtained via the combination of 1 and infinite norm. Interestingly enough, although infinite norm alone does not lead to sparse results, it helps to enhance the sparsity of 1 norm regularization. The optimal solution has a favorable piecewise linearity, based on which the whole solution path can be obtained, and this greatly facilitates model selection. The strict proof for piecewise linearity is given in the appendix. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach offers comparable prediction accuracy with significantly higher sparsity.","2164-4357;21644357","Electronic:978-1-4577-0345-4; POD:978-1-4577-0343-0","10.1109/ICIST.2012.6221693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6221693","","Equations;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Standards;Support vector machines;Training","support vector machines","1 norm constraints;1 norm support vector machine;infinite norm constraints;infinite norm support vector machine;model selection;norm regularization;piecewise linearity;sparse vertices;zero norm SVM","","0","","15","","","23-25 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The random scaling parameter, Nyström approximation and random initialization of k-means are used to perturb SC for producing the components of an ensemble system. A measure integrating diversity and quality is proposed to evaluate the quality of all the obtained results.

To accurately classify the minority class, current methods rely on sampling schemes to close the gap between classes, or on the application of error costs to create algorithms which favor the minority class. Since the sampling schemes and costs must be specified, these methods are highly dependent on the class distributions present in the training set. This makes them difficult to apply in settings where the level of imbalance changes, such as in online streaming data. Often they cannot handle multi-class problems. We present a novel single-class algorithm called Class Conditional Nearest Neighbor Distribution (CCNND), which mitigates the effects of class imbalance through local geometric structure in the data. Our algorithm can be applied seamlessly to problems with any level of imbalance or number of classes, and new examples are simply added to the training set. We show that it performs as well as or better than top sampling and cost-weighting methods on four imbalanced datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and then apply it to streaming data from the oil and gas industry alongside a modified nearest neighbor algorithm. Our algorithm's competitive performance relative to the state-of-the-art, coupled with its extremely simple implementation and automatic adjustment for minority classes, demonstrates that it is worth further study.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4673-1490-9; POD:978-1-4673-1488-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252718","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252718","","Error analysis;Machine learning;Oscillators;Sensitivity;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sampling methods;statistical distributions","UCI machine learning repository;class conditional nearest neighbor distribution;class imbalance problem;gas industry;imbalanced classification;oil industry;online streaming data;sampling schemes;single-class algorithm","","1","","9","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we consider the problem of identifying the organizational structure within an environment, i.e. the problem of determining organizational principles that would allow a robot to infer where to best place a particular, previously unseen object or where to reasonably search for a particular type of object given past observations about the allocation of objects to locations in the environment. This problem can be reasonably formulated as a classification task. We claim that organizational principles are governed by the notion of similarity and provide an empirical analysis of the importance of various features in datasets describing the organizational structure of kitchens. For the aforementioned classification tasks, we compare standard classification methods, reaching average accuracies of at least 79% in all scenarios. We thereby show that, in particular, ontology-based similarity measures are well-suited as highly discriminative features.

The method is conceptually simple: it solves a linear system at each iteration and it converges, typically, within a few iterations. Its complexity is obviously related to the size of the system which, in the linear case, is equal to the input pattern dimension. The method is extended to the non-linear case using kernels.
