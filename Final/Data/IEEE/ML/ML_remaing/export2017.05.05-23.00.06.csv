Two major concerns in engineering software systems are high maintenance costs and reliability of systems. To reduce maintenance efforts, there is a need for automated tools to help software developers understand their existing code base. So, there is a need to extract specifications to aid program comprehension. In this paper a novel technique to efficiently mine software specifications, called TM_TraceMiner is proposed which mines software specifications from program execution traces. The Transaction Mapping algorithm is currently one of the fastest approaches. To address the limitations of Apriori-like methods and FP-growth methods, a mining paradigm has been proposed, which uses Transaction Mapping algorithm.

In machine learning, this is frequently achieved using, as a penalty term, the L<sub>p</sub> norm of the model parameters, with p Â¿ 1 for efficient dilution. Here we propose a statistical-mechanics analysis of the problem in the setting of perceptron memorization and generalization. Using a replica approach, we are able to evaluate the relative performance of naive dilution (obtained by learning without dilution, following by applying a threshold to the model parameters), L<sub>1</sub> dilution (which is frequently used in convex optimization) and L<sub>0</sub> dilution (which is optimal but computationally hard to implement).

However, creating a tractable mathematical mapping model from environmental variables to transmitter parameters that allows the latter to be optimized in any sense, presents serious challenges due to the large number of variables involved, as well as the complexity required in any model with the ability to accurately capture and explain all factors that affect performance. Machine learning algorithms, which make no mathematical assumptions and use only past observations to model the input-output relationship, have recently been explored for adaptation in MIMO-OFDM systems. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning algorithm based on multi-class support vector machines (SVMs). Our algorithm has considerably smaller operational overhead (including storage requirements) and better performance for link adaptation. With IEEE 802.11n simulations we show that our new algorithm outperforms existing machine-learning based algorithms. Moreover, we show that our algorithm is (asymptotically) consistent, in the sense that as the number of training data used increases, our algorithm obtains the performance-optimal classifier.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5871-4; POD:978-1-4244-5870-7","10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394863","","Fading;MIMO;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Modulation coding;OFDM;Support vector machines;Throughput;Transmitters;Wireless communication","MIMO communication;OFDM modulation;support vector machines","MIMO-OFDM wireless system;coding rate;link adaptation;machine learning;modulation order;multiclass support vector machine;performance-optimal classifier;transmitter parameter","","4","","24","","","Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RS samples from the original feature set and builds one (base) classifier on each subset. The ensemble assigns a class label by either majority voting or averaging of output probabilities. Looking for guidelines for setting the two parameters of the method-ensemble size and feature sample size-we introduce three criteria calculated through these parameters: usability of the selected feature sets, coverage of the set of ¿¿important¿¿ features, and feature set diversity. Optimized together, these criteria work toward producing accurate and diverse individual classifiers. RS was tested on three fMRI datasets from single-subject experiments: the Haxby data (Haxby, 2001.) and two datasets collected in-house. We found that RS with support vector machines (SVM) as the base classifier outperformed single classifiers as well as some of the most widely used classifier ensembles such as bagging, AdaBoost, random forest, and rotation forest. The closest rivals were the single SVM and bagging of SVM classifiers.

Humans have an ability to learn the machine operation unconsciously. Therefore, proposed technique is attempted to utilize the human ability. Optimum operability in machine operation is defined as when a operated machine with Â¿human calculated dynamics modelÂ¿ coincides with its Â¿machine dynamics.Â¿ Based on this definition, we propose calibration that brings the machine dynamics closer to the human calculated machine model. The human learning ability corresponds to approach the human calculated dynamics model to operated machine dynamics. So changes in machine dynamics appear to pose problems that both make operators uncomfortable and hinder their learning. The calibration technique for changes in machine dynamics without operator awareness quantifying perception based on cognitive scientific knowledge is proposed. We applied this calibration, named subliminal calibration, to a task involving the maneuvering of a mobile vehicle and the performance is improved. Since the scheme employs human input prediction by human model with neural network, the calibration performance depends on its prediction accuracy. A technique to improve the prediction accuracy is also discussed in this paper.

Recently, many approaches based on the idea of Â¿learning to rankÂ¿ have been proposed for this task and most of them attempt to score all documents of different queries by resorting to a single function. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of query-dependent ranking. A simple similarity measure is used to calculate similarities between queries. An individual ranking model is constructed for each training query with corresponding documents. When a new query is asked, documents retrieved for the new query are ranked according to the scores determined by a ranking model which is combined from the models of similar training queries. A mechanism for determining combining weights is also provided. Experimental results show that this query-dependent ranking approach is more effective than other approaches.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3881-5; POD:978-1-4244-5285-9","10.1109/WCSE.2009.666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403423","Query-dependent ranking;model combination;query similarity;ranking model;web mining","Boosting;Computer industry;Computer science;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Search engines;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data;Web mining","data mining;document handling;query processing;search engines","Web mining;document processing;query dependent ranking;ranking model;search engine;training query","","5","","18","","","28-30 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the one hand, for general video annotation methods, the estimation of pairwise similarity between two samples relies on the spatial property of video data. On the other hand, temporal property, which is an essential character of video data, is not embedded into the pairwise similarity metric. Therefore, in this paper, a novel method, called joint spatio-temporal correlation learning (JSTCL), is proposed to improve the accuracy of video annotation.

Accurate determination of the pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) properties such as the bubble point pressure (P<sub>b</sub>) and the oil formation volume factor (B<sub>ob</sub>) are important in the primary and subsequent development of an oil field. This paper proposes Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a novel machine learning technique for predicting outputs in uncertain situations using the Â¿-Support Vector Regression (Â¿-SVR) method. The objective of this research is to investigate the capability of SVRs in modeling PVT properties of crude oil systems and solving existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) drawbacks. Three datasets used for training and testing the SVR prediction model were collected from distinct published sources. The Â¿-SVR model incorporates four input features from the datasets: (1) solution gas-oil ratio, (2) reservoir temperature, (3) oil gravity and, (4) gas relative density. A comparative study is carried out to compare Â¿-SVR performance with ANNs, nonlinear regression, and different empirical correlation techniques. The results obtained reveal that the Â¿-SVR once successfully trained and optimized is more accurate, reliable, and outperforms the other existing approaches such as empirical correlation for estimating crude oil PVT properties.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5145-6; POD:978-1-4244-5144-9","10.1109/ICEENVIRON.2009.5398681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5398681","PVT properties;Support vector machine;bubble point pressue;oil formation volume factor;support vector regression","Artificial neural networks;Economic forecasting;Gravity;Hydrocarbon reservoirs;Machine learning;Petroleum;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Temperature;Testing","crude oil;economics;hydrocarbon reservoirs;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;regression analysis;support vector machines","artificial neural network;crude oil systems;economics;empirical correlation techniques;machine learning;nonlinear regression;oil reservoir;pressure-volume-temperature properties;support vector machines;Â¿-support vector regression","","1","","26","","","7-8 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classification of Web pages into each category exclusively relies on man power which cost much time and effort. To alleviate this manually classification problem, more researchers focus on the issue of Web pages classification technology. In this paper, we proposed Random Forest Classifier (RF) based on random forest method for multi-category Web page classification. The proposed RF classifier can classify Web pages efficiently according to their corresponding class without using other feature selection methods.

To further refine the above selection set, class prior densities were also exploited. The proposed framework was tested on an automatic image annotation application using a subset of the Corel image set. When all data, including both initially labeled and incrementally learned samples, were used, the final model was shown to achieve a significant improvement over the initial set of classifiers in terms of micro-averaging F1 even when only a small number of images were initially labeled.

The proposed router not only offers common configurable parameters including buffers, virtual-channels and routing algorithms, but also has its inner-pipeline parameterized. The pipeline may be organized as the conventional 3-stage one, 4-stage one or the in-house 5-stage one. The 5-stage pipelining scheme is a variation of the 4-stage one, but has the longest stage for virtual-channel allocation in the ancestor split into two stages. Then it may achieve higher maximum frequency. The packet latency in a wormhole-switch network was decomposed, and the impact from pipelining scheme and the number of virtual-channels was evaluated. A principle was proposed for on-chip router design, which arouses higher frequency for more performance and less packet latency.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4607-0; POD:978-1-4244-4606-3","10.1109/PACIIA.2009.5406630","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5406630","network-on-chip;pipeline;synthesizable;virtual channel;wormhole router","Computer networks;Delay;Fabrics;Frequency;Machine learning;Network synthesis;Network-on-a-chip;Pipeline processing;Routing;Switches","buffer storage;channel allocation;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip;pipeline processing;telecommunication network routing","buffers;computation-intensive tasks;inter-cores communication;multicore;network-on-chip;on-chip router design;pipeline;routing algorithms;synthesizable on-chip wormhole router;virtual-channel allocation;virtual-channels;wormhole-switch network","","0","","6","","","28-29 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm is applied to coefficients extracted by two feature extraction techniques: the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The proposed PSO-based feature selection algorithm is utilized to search the feature space for the optimal feature subset where features are carefully selected according to a well defined discrimination criterion. Evolution is driven by a fitness function defined in terms of maximizing the class separation (scatter index). The classifier performance and the length of selected feature vector are considered for performance evaluation using the ORL face database.

However, geographic scope is a concept that can be interpreted in many different ways, ranging from the expected target scope of a specific content to the country where the content originated. The latter, in particular, albeit difficult to address, is of great importance for many reasons, such as, for example, market inquiries or anytime estimates on content production in specific countries are needed. Search engines may also be affected by the knowledge of the various kinds of geographic scopes, to better tune their responses to queries, e.g. according to (but not restricted to) the geographic proximity with the user location. However that information is rarely available and must be inferred in the vast majority of the cases. In this paper we propose a technique, grounded into the machine learning theory, to estimate source geography of web pages by means of a classifier learned on a specially constructed training set. The training set, consisting of a number of features extracted from web pages and the corresponding source-geography label (i.e. the country of origin of the web page) is automatically built by exploiting the wide number of pages with contents licensed under a localized Creative Commons (CC) license. The model thus learned is then used to classify unlabeled records and our tests showed a mean accuracy of 81% with a standard deviation of 0:9.","2162-7843;21627843","Electronic:978-1-4244-5950-6; POD:978-1-4244-5949-0","10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407588","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5407588","Classification;Geographic information retrieval","Data mining;Estimation theory;Feature extraction;Geography;Information retrieval;Internet;Machine learning;Production;Search engines;Web pages","Bayes methods;Internet;classification;geography;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","Naive Bayes models;Web pages;classifier;geographic proximity;geographic scope;localized Creative Commons license;machine learning theory;search engines;source geography estimation;user location","","0","","24","","","14-17 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We address these problems by developing a machine learning model that predicts the mean of any given metric, e.g. cycles or energy, across a range of programs, for any microarchitectural configuration. It works by combining only the most representative programs from the benchmark suite based on their behaviour in the design space under consideration. We use our model to predict the mean performance, energy, energy-delay (ED) and energy-delay-squared (EDD) of the SPEC CPU 2000 and MiBench benchmark suites within our design space.

The effect of the strategies for generating the members, combining the predictions and the size of the ensemble on the accuracy of the ensemble are of utmost interest to the researchers. In this paper, we propose and empirically evaluate a novel method for generating members of ensemble based on 'learning-from-mistakes' paradigm. SVM is used as the base learner, and a series of dependent classifiers is obtained using model based instance selection method. In each iteration, all the wrongly classified records are merged with the support vectors to capture diversity. Classifiers with accuracy higher than the average of the series are selected for ensemble construction. Simple majority voting has been used to combine learners. The approach has been empirically found efficient as very few classifiers need to be generated and even fewer are selected. Accuracy on the test sets is comparable to bagging and boosting based methods.","","Electronic:978-9-3800-4357-9; POD:978-1-4244-5051-0","10.1109/ICM2CS.2009.5397955","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5397955","Classifier Ensemble;Diversity;SVM","Accuracy;Bagging;Classification algorithms;Computer science;Diversity reception;Machine learning;Predictive models;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","SVM;bagging based method;boosting based method;dependent classifiers;efficient classifier ensemble;iteration;learning-from-mistakes paradigm;machine learning community;model based instance seletion method;support vector machine;wrongly classified records","","1","","29","","","14-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm overcomes this problem, but its computational cost is quadratic in the problem dimension. In this paper we propose a two timescale stochastic approximation algorithm which, as far as its slower timescale is considered, behaves the same way as the RLS algorithm, while it is as cheap as the LMS algorithm. In addition, the algorithm is easy to implement. The algorithm is shown to give estimates that converge to the best possible estimate with probability one. The performance of the algorithm is tested in two examples and it is found that it may indeed offer some performance gain over the LMS algorithm.","0191-2216;01912216","Electronic:978-1-4244-3872-3; POD:978-1-4244-3871-6","10.1109/CDC.2009.5400370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5400370","","Approximation algorithms;Automatic control;Computational complexity;Computational efficiency;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Least squares approximation;Machine learning algorithms;Resonance light scattering;Signal processing algorithms;Stochastic processes","approximation theory;gradient methods;least mean squares methods","LMS-2;computational cost;least mean square algorithm;linear prediction problem;recursive least squares algorithm;stochastic environment;stochastic gradient descent rule;timescale stochastic approximation","","0","","14","","","15-18 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional scheduling algorithms will fail due to the static rules used and much user intervention required. We suggest that learning with neural networks is promising to solve this problem. In this paper we propose a fast and intelligent resource selection algorithm based on neural networks. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is exploited as the learning paradigm due to its fast learning speed and satisfactory performance.

Speech feature extraction constitutes the front end module of any speech decoder: it plays an essential role and has a strong impact on the recognition performance. The research community is aggressively searching for more powerful solutions which combine the existing feature extraction methods for a better and more reliable information capture from the analog speech signal. In this research work, we propose new approaches to combining phoneme recognizers' output in order to provide better recognition performance and improved robustness with respect to noise and channel distortions. Machine learning tools such as the naive Bayes classifier, decision trees, and support vector machines have been used in the combination of hypotheses. Experiments under different SNR levels have proven that our proposed approach outperforms the two most common feature extraction techniques, namely mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and perceptual linear prediction (PLP) with cepstral mean subtraction (CMS) and RASTA respectively, for channel normalization.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4398-7; POD:978-1-4244-4397-0","10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5412292","Phoneme recognition;SNR;decoder combination;feature extraction","Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Decoding;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Noise robustness;Speech enhancement;Speech recognition;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;audio signal processing;decision trees;distortion;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);speech coding;speech enhancement;speech recognition;support vector machines","analog speech signal;cepstral mean subtraction;channel distortion;channel normalization;decision trees;machine learning;mel frequency cepstral coefficients;naive Bayes classifier;noise distortion;perceptual linear prediction;phoneme recognition enhancement;robust speech decoder;speech feature extraction;support vector machines","","0","","11","","","6-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SMOTE (synthetic minority over-sampling technique) is specifically designed for learning from imbalanced data sets. This paper presents a modified approach (MSMOTE) for learning from imbalanced data sets, based on the SMOTE algorithm. MSMOTE not only considers the distribution of minority class samples, but also eliminates noise samples by adaptive mediation. The combination of MSMOTE and AdaBoost are applied to several highly and moderately imbalanced data sets.

Using this gradient to define the minimum of the functional, the convergence to this minimum is discussed at length. The theorems proved in this paper apply as well to discrete as to continuous optimization problems and as such, the developed technique is competitive with stochastic automata with a variable structure. The optimality of the scheme follows from the convergence in probability of the average performance to the minimum. The freedom in the organization of the search within the boundaries outlined by the conditions of convergence is emphasized.

This paper concerns using rough set for attribution ranking and reducing and using support vector machine for intrusion detection classification. An elicitation attribution reduction algorithm (EARA) based on attribution significance and discernibility matrix is presented and three data discretization algorithms were applied to identify the important attributions.
