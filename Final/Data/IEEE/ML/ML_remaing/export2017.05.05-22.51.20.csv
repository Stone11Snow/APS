"A Practical Approach to Model Selection for Support Vector Machines With a Gaussian Kernel","M. Varewyck; J. P.

This so-called generalization ability obviously depends on the choices of the learning parameters that control the learning process. Model selection is the method for identifying appropriate values for these parameters. In this paper, a novel model selection method for SVMs with a Gaussian kernel is proposed. Its aim is to find suitable values for the kernel parameter Î³ and the cost parameter <i>C</i> with a minimum amount of central processing unit time. The determination of the kernel parameter is based on the argument that, for most patterns, the decision function of the SVM should consist of a sufficiently large number of significant contributions. A unique property of the proposed method is that it retrieves the kernel parameter as a simple analytical function of the dimensionality of the feature space and the dispersion of the classes in that space. An experimental evaluation on a test bed of 17 classification problems has shown that the new method favorably competes with two recently published methods: the classification of new patterns is equally good, but the computational effort to identify the learning parameters is substantially lower.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2053026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5545419","Data mining;model selection;pattern classification;support vector machine (SVM)","Central Processing Unit;Costs;Error analysis;Kernel;Machine learning;Pattern classification;Process control;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","Gaussian processes;generalisation (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","Gaussian kernel;central processing unit time;cost parameter;generalization ability;kernel parameter;labeled development patterns;learning process;model selection method;support vector machine","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Models, Statistical;Models, Theoretical;Normal Distribution;Pattern Recognition, Automated","16","","23","","20100809","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To this end, the proposed approach (termed MKL-DR) generalizes the framework of multiple kernel learning for dimensionality reduction, and distinguishes itself with the following three main contributions: First, our method provides the convenience of using diverse image descriptors to describe useful characteristics of various aspects about the underlying data.

The need for efficient utilization of telemetry data achieved by employing machine learning and reasoning algorithms has been pointed out in the literature for enhancing diagnostic performance and assisting the less-experienced personnel in performing monitoring and diagnosis tasks. In this paper, we develop a systematic and transparent fault-diagnosis methodology within a hierarchical fault-diagnosis framework for a satellites formation flight. We present our proposed hierarchical decomposition framework through a novel Bayesian network, whose structure is developed from the knowledge of component health-state dependencies. We have developed a methodology for specifying the network parameters that utilizes both node fault-diagnosis performance data and domain experts' beliefs. Our proposed model development procedure reduces the demand for expert's time in eliciting probabilities significantly. Our proposed approach provides the ground personnel with an ability to perform diagnostic reasoning across a number of subsystems and components coherently. Due to the unavailability of real formation flight data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by using synthetic data of a leader-follower formation flight architecture.

The attributes of network traffic flows are selected and assigned the corresponding weightings according to their importance by evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results show that this algorithm can effectively select the subset from multiple attributes that can best reflect the differences among some most popular P2P protocols and also between P2P and non-P2P protocols.

Increasingly for modern scientific data sets, the number of sample points is less than the number of features and so the sample covariance is not invertible. In such circumstances, the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse sample covariance matrix, constructed from the eigenvectors corresponding to nonzero sample covariance eigenvalues, is often used as an approximation to the inverse population covariance matrix. The reconstruction error of the pseudo-inverse sample covariance matrix in estimating the true inverse covariance can be quantified via the Frobenius norm of the difference between the two. The reconstruction error is dominated by the smallest nonzero sample covariance eigenvalues and diverges as the sample size becomes comparable to the number of features. For high-dimensional data, we use random matrix theory techniques and results to study the reconstruction error for a wide class of population covariance matrices. We also show how bagging and random subspace methods can result in a reduction in the reconstruction error and can be combined to improve the accuracy of classifiers that utilize the pseudo-inverse sample covariance matrix. We test our analysis on both simulated and benchmark data sets.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601741","Pseudo-inverse;bagging;linear discriminants;peaking phenomenon;random matrix theory;random subspace method.","Accuracy;Bagging;Covariance matrix;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Machine learning;Simulation;Upper bound","covariance matrices;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;learning (artificial intelligence)","Frobenius norm;covariance eigenvalues;inverse population covariance;pseudo-inverse covariance learning;random matrix theory analysis;reconstruction error","","13","","40","","20101014","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For instance, from initial tests, a high correlation between the grade of pepper berries to the colour features has been detected. Using existing machine learning algorithms in WEKA, we have obtained a 100% accuracy in categorising the pepper berries into the correct grades.

It uses some distance measures and clustering algorithms to group tests into some clusters. Tests in a same cluster are considered to have similar behaviors. A certain sampling strategy for the clustering result is used to build up a small subset of tests, which is expected to approximate the fault detection capability of the original test set. All existing cluster test selection methods employ unsupervised clustering. The previous test results are not used in the process of clustering. It may lead to unsatisfactory clustering results in some cases. In this paper, a semi-supervised clustering method, namely semi-supervised K-means (SSKM), is introduced to improve cluster test selection. SSKM uses limited supervision in the form of pair wise constraints: Must-link and Cannot-link. These pair wise constraints are derived from previous test results to improve clustering results as well as test selection results. The experiment results illustrate the effectiveness of cluster test selection methods with SSKM. Two useful observations are made by analysis. (1) Cluster test selection with SSKM has a better effectiveness when the failed tests are in a medium proportion.

This paper is to obtain an appropriate data representation through feature selection or kernel learning within the framework of the Local Learning-Based Clustering (LLC) (Wu and SchoÌlkopf 2006) method, which can outperform the global learning-based ones when dealing with the high-dimensional data lying on manifold. Specifically, we associate a weight to each feature or kernel and incorporate it into the built-in regularization of the LLC algorithm to take into account the relevance of each feature or kernel for the clustering. Accordingly, the weights are estimated iteratively in the clustering process. We show that the resulting weighted regularization with an additional constraint on the weights is equivalent to a known sparse-promoting penalty. Hence, the weights of those irrelevant features or kernels can be shrunk toward zero.

Winning an ODI cricket match depends on various factors related to scoring as well as physical strength of the two teams. Some of the factors have been described in the literature but there is scope for further research on analyzing them, especially with reference to predicting victory. Interesting factors include home game advantage, day/night effect, winning the toss and batting first. In this article, we have used artificial intelligence techniques, more specifically Bayesian classifiers in machine learning, to predict how these factors affect the outcome of an ODI cricket match. Based on the emerged results, we have developed a software tool called CricAI. This tool outputs the probability of victory in an ODI cricket match using input factors such as home game advantage available at the beginning of the match. The CricAI tool can be used in real-world applications by teams playing cricket. It can accordingly be helpful in adjusting certain factors in order to maximize the chances of winning the real game.","2151-1802;21511802","Electronic:978-1-4244-8552-9; POD:978-1-4244-8549-9","10.1109/ICIAFS.2010.5715668","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715668","AI and Automation;Bayes Thoerem;Classifiers;Predictive Analysis;Probability;Sports Applications","Africa;Australia;Classification algorithms;Classification tree analysis;Games;Machine learning","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sport","Bayesian classifiers;CricAI;ODI cricket;artificial intelligence techniques;machine learning;sport","","3","","17","","","17-19 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then these labelled subspaces are projected to each continuous feature.The measurement of each feature is estimated for a subspace against all other subspace-projected features by means of statistical significance.Through the construction of a matrix of the measurements of the subspaces by all features,the subspace-projected features are ranked in a descending order based on the discriminant ability of each feature in the matrix.After evaluating a gain function of the discriminant ability defined by the best-so-far feature subset,the resulting feature subset can be incrementally determined.

In distributed settings, however, the learning may be complex and slow due to coupled decision making processes resulting in non-stationarities. The docitive paradigm proposes a timely solution based on knowledge sharing, which allows femtocells to develop new capacities for selecting appropriate actions. We demonstrate that this improves the femtocells' learning ability and accuracy, and gives them strategies for action selection in unvis-ited states. We evaluate the docitive paradigms in the context of a 3GPP compliant OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) based femtocell network modeled as a multi-agent system, where the agents implement a real-time multi-agent reinforcement learning technique known as decentralized Q-learning. Our goal is to solve the well known coexistence problem between macro and femto systems by controlling the aggregated interference generated by multiple femtocells at the macrocell receiver.

As such, society demands that these networks remain secure. In order to maintain security the systems used to protect these networks, which are vital to the 21st century world, must be constantly updated. The task of creating a system for the 21st century fell upon several groups for the ACM 1999 KDD Cup Competition. The competition produced a winning entry, but something was lacking: The winning team's results for two of the intrusion types, User-to-Root and Remote-to-Local, were subpar at best. The winning team produced a 13.8% and 8.4% detection rate for these types respectively, compared to over 90% for each of the Denial of Service and Probing intrusion types. This research aimed to rectify this shortcoming. By implementing an unsupervised learning system, this research has produced a system that correctly detects 62.8% of User-to-Root attacks within the same dataset, with minimal false positives, while maintaining the high detection rates of Denial of Service and Probing attacks.","","Electronic:978-0-9564263-7-6; POD:978-1-4244-8879-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5749879","","Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Probes;Testing;Training;Training data","computer network security;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","KDD Cup 1999 Dataset;computer networks;denial of service attacks;e-commerce;online banking;probing attacks;remote-to-local network intrusion detection;self-organizing feature maps;social networking;unsupervised learning system;user-to-root network intrusion detection","","0","","7","","","21-23 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, we propose a framework whereby the classification problem is a special case of the more general categorization problem. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised algorithm that can incorporate data with multiple labels drawn from a hierarchy to learn a categorical representation. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to learn the underlying hierarchy and to generalize to data outside of the training set.

In the current work, we propose the combination of Meta-Learning and search techniques to the problem of SVM parameter selection. Given an input problem, Meta-Learning is used to recommend SVM parameters based on well-succeeded parameters adopted in previous similar problems. The parameters returned by Meta-Learning are then used as initial search points to a search technique which will perform a further exploration of the parameter space. In this combination, we envisioned that the initial solutions provided by Meta-Learning are located in good regions in the search space (i.e. they are closer to the optimum solutions). Hence, the search technique would need to evaluate a lower number of candidate search points in order to find an adequate solution. In our work, we implemented a prototype in which Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was used to select the values of two SVM parameters for regression problems. In the performed experiments, the proposed solution was compared to a PSO with random initialization, obtaining better average results on a set of 40 regression problems.","1522-4899;15224899","Electronic:978-0-7695-4210-2; POD:978-1-4244-8391-4","10.1109/SBRN.2010.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715217","Meta-Learning;Particle Swarm Optimization;Support Vector Machines","Correlation;Kernel;Machine learning;Particle swarm optimization;Prototypes;Search problems;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;regression analysis;search problems;set theory;support vector machines","SVM parameter selection;metalearning;particle swarm optimization;regression problem;regularization parameter;support vector machine","","6","","21","","","23-28 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the differences in the characteristics of these two kinds of data, attempts to develop criteria functions for mixed data have been not very successful. In this research, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer technique to solve this problem. First, the original mixed dataset is divided into two sub-datasets: the pure categorical dataset and the pure numeric dataset. Next, existing well established clustering algorithms designed for different types of datasets are employed to produce corresponding clusters. Last, the clustering results on the categorical and numeric dataset are combined as a categorical dataset, on which the categorical data clustering algorithm is employed to get the final output.

The scope of the research reported here is to investigate the efficiency of machine learning techniques in a number of different biomedical problems. To this end, a number of experiments have been conducted using representative learning algorithms. The decision of which particular method to choose is a complicated problem. A good alternative to choosing only one method is to create a hybrid forecasting system incorporating a number of possible solution methods as components (an ensemble of classifiers). For this purpose, we have implemented a hybrid decision support system that combines the representative algorithms using a stacking variant methodology and achieves better performance than any examined simple and ensemble method. In this work, we use a feature selection pre-process before the usage of the stacking. Feature subset selection is the process of identifying and removing as much irrelevant and redundant features as possible. This reduces the dimensionality of the data enabling the proposed ensemble to operate faster and more effectively.","","Electronic:978-89-88678-32-9; POD:978-1-4244-8599-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5713483","bioinforamatics;component;computational biology;medical decision support systems","Biology;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Stacking;Training","bioinformatics;cellular biophysics;decision support systems;diseases;drugs;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;pattern classification;statistical analysis;tumours","biomedical problem handling;cell histology;classifier;disease;drug response;gene expression data;hybrid decision support system;hybrid forecasting system;machine learning;patient treatment;representative learning algorithm;statistical technique;tumor morphology","","0","","29","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intelligently managing and allocating resources among various clients is important for system providers, whose business model relies on managing the infrastructure resources in a cost-effective manner while satisfying the client service level agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we address the issue of how to intelligently manage the resources in a shared cloud database system and present SmartSLA, a cost-aware resource management system. SmartSLA consists of two main components: the system modeling module and the resource allocation decision module. The system modeling module uses machine learning techniques to learn a model that describes the potential profit margins for each client under different resource allocations. Based on the learned model, the resource allocation decision module dynamically adjusts the resource allocations in order to achieve the optimum profits. We evaluate SmartSLA by using the TPC-W benchmark with workload characteristics derived from real-life systems. The performance results indicate that SmartSLA can successfully compute predictive models under different hardware resource allocations, such as CPU and memory, as well as database specific resources, such as the number of replicas in the database systems. The experimental results also show that SmartSLA can provide intelligent service differentiation according to factors such as variable workloads, SLA levels, resource costs, and deliver improved profit margins.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4244-8960-2; POD:978-1-4244-8959-6; USB:978-1-4244-8958-9","10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767928","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5767928","cloud computing;database systems;multitenant databases;virtualization","Databases;Linear regression;Machine learning;Regression tree analysis;Resource management;System performance;Time factors","cloud computing;database management systems;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;virtualisation","SmartSLA;TPC-W benchmark;cloud computing environment;database systems;intelligent management;machine learning techniques;resource allocation decision module;resource management system;service level agreements;shared cloud database system;system modeling module;virtualized resources","","37","3","27","","","11-16 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, it has been shown that decision trees outperform traditional approaches also on limited data. Therefore, increasing the decision tree classification accuracy yields better performance on both huge and moderate sized datasets. This paper proposes a practical algorithm to deal with the data specific classification problem when there are datasets with different properties. Another key motivation of the data specific pruning in the paper is ""trading accuracy and size"". A novel algorithm called Expert Knowledge Based Pruning, EKBP is proposed to solve this dilemma. We proposed to integrate error rate, missing values and expert judgment as factors for determining data specific pruning for each dataset.

We show that it is possible to transform this intuitive observation into statistically informative features using second order Markov models. Four transition matrices are built from known legitimate domain names, known malicious domain names, English words in a dictionary, and based on a uniform distribution.

Our random sampling method depends on small random subset of attributes and it is computationally cheap to act on such a set in a reasonable time. The superiority of the composite splitting criterion can persist when used for high dimensional datasets with irrelevant attributes.

At the same time, some common P2P protocols are tested with the method, including HTTP, OICQ, DNS and Edonkey. Experimental results show that using this identification method can quickly and effectively judge P2P flow. The method can also deal with network congestion to a certain extent by identifying and monitoring P2P traffic.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8026-5; POD:978-1-4244-8025-8","10.1109/ICACIA.2010.5709888","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5709888","P2P;complex networks;connection degree;traffic identification","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;IP networks;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Peer to peer computing;Protocols","peer-to-peer computing;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","P2P protocols;P2P traffic;content encrypted techniques;network traffic management;nodes connection degree","","0","","17","","","17-19 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The controller utilizes an internal, nonlinear autorotation model and is capable of handling input and output constraints that directly map to quality, efficiency and safety requirements. The RNN is employed to achieve real-time operation because it is capable of improving convergence performance, especially when hardware that supports task parallelization is available. This is of major importance when dealing with small unmanned helicopters with limited onboard computational power, where high update rates are required to successfully perform the autorotation maneuver. The proposed NMPC/RNN combination signifies the first use of a nonlinear model for online autorotation trajectory optimization, thus allowing for easier adaptation to other helicopter types without the need for retraining as in the case of machine learning techniques used by the state-of-the-art. An additional novelty of this research concerns the use of an objective function designed to eliminate the risk of fatalities to people on the ground. This is in contrast to previous works where the goal was to save the aircraft and is achieved by appropriately lowering the kinetic energy of the helicopter during the last phase of its descent. The paper discusses in detail the general design of the NMPC/RNN, before going into the specifics regarding the derivation, implementation and integration of the autonomous autorotation controller itself. The performance of the latter is validated using extensive simulation results.","1063-6536;10636536","","10.1109/TCST.2010.2054092","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5524095","Helicopters;predictive control;public safety;recurrent neural networks (RNNs);unmanned systems","Convergence;Hardware;Helicopters;High performance computing;Machine learning;Neural networks;Predictive control;Predictive models;Recurrent neural networks;Safety","aircraft control;helicopters;mobile robots;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;optimisation;position control;predictive control;recurrent neural nets;remotely operated vehicles","autonomous vertical autorotation problem;autorotation trajectory optimization;fatality risk elimination;machine learning techniques;neural network optimization;nonlinear autorotation model;nonlinear model predictive control;nonlinear optimization;recurrent neural network;safety requirements;small unmanned helicopters","","23","","28","","20100726","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Systematic data analysis methods are necessary to extract useful information from rapidly growing data banks. Cluster analysis is one of the major data mining methods and the k-means clustering algorithm is widely used for many practical applications. But the original k-means algorithm is computationally expensive and the quality of the resulting clusters substantially relies on the choice of initial centroids. Several methods have been proposed in the literature for improving the performance of the k-means algorithm. This paper proposes an improvement on the classic k-means algorithm to produce more accurate clusters. The proposed algorithm comprises of a O(n logn) heuristic method, based on sorting and partitioning the input data, for finding the initial centroids in accordance with the data distribution. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm produces better clusters in less computation time.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4329-1; POD:978-1-4244-9683-9","10.1109/EAIT.2011.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734940","Clustering;Data Mining;Enhanced k-means Algorithm;Improved Initial Centroids;Sorting and Partitioning","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms","data analysis;data mining;pattern clustering","O(n logn) heuristic method;cluster analysis;data analysis methods;data banks;data distribution;data mining methods;data partitioning;data sorting;information extraction;initial centroid;k-means clustering algorithm enhancement","","4","","18","","","19-20 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of the earthworm microarray experiment is to unearth the biomarker for toxicity evaluation. We propose a novel recursive gene selection method which can handle the multi-class setting effectively and efficiently. The selection is performed iteratively. In each iteration, a linear multi-class classifier is trained using 1-norm regularization, which leads to sparse weight vectors, i.e., many feature weights are exactly zero. Those zero-weight features are eliminated in the next iteration. The empirical results demonstrate that the selected features (genes) have very competitive discriminative power. In addition, the selection process has fast rate of convergence.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8307-5; POD:978-1-4244-8306-8","10.1109/BIBM.2010.5706621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5706621","1-norm Regularization;Gene Selection;Microarray;Multi-class classification","Accuracy;Bioinformatics;Cancer;Gene expression;Grippers;Machine learning;Support vector machines","explosives;genetics;genomics;toxicology","1-norm regularization;RDX;TNT;biomarker;earthworm microarray experiment;explosive compound;multiclass microarray data;recursive gene selection method;toxicological effect","","1","","26","","","18-21 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each bag contains a number of instances from which features are extracted. The complexity of MIL is largely dependent on the number of instances in the training data set. Since we are usually confronted with a large instance space even for moderately sized real-world data sets applications, it is important to design efficient instance selection techniques to speed up the training process without compromising the performance. In this paper, we address the issue of instance selection in MIL. We propose MILIS, a novel MIL algorithm based on adaptive instance selection. We do this in an alternating optimization framework by intertwining the steps of instance selection and classifier learning in an iterative manner which is guaranteed to converge. Initial instance selection is achieved by a simple yet effective kernel density estimator on the negative instances. Experimental results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed approach as compared to the state of the art.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5557878","Multiple instance learning;alternating optimization.;feature selection;support vector machine","Algorithm design and analysis;Machine learning;Optimization;Prototypes;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence)","MILIS;instance selection;iterative manner;kernel density estimator;multiple instance learning;real-world data sets application;supervised learning","","63","","37","","20100826","May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
