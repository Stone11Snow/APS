We need an efficient method for target motion retrieval. In this paper, we propose the method of analyzing motion data in advance, and express the construction of movement with indexed labels for reducing similar-motion retrieval. The posture of each frame is distinguished into the pattern of the indexed labels, and we therefore try to index each motion data. Firstly, we reduce the number of dimensions of motion data with PCA (Principal Components Analysis) and do clustering. Next, a trained dictionary is consisted of the indexed motion data. Finally, SVM (Support Vector Machine) distinguishes the test data by using the dictionary. In this research, we made the trained dictionary from the movement of radio gymnastics, and then carried out an evaluation of discrimination by using break dance movement as test data. As a result, we could use the motion data with indexes, and obtained a good retrieval result in this experiment.","","POD:978-1-4244-4717-6","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5337523","Machine Learning;Motion Data;Similarity Retrieval","Dictionaries;Gravity;Information retrieval;Legged locomotion;Motion analysis;Multimedia systems;Principal component analysis;Signal processing;Support vector machines;Testing","image motion analysis;image retrieval;principal component analysis;support vector machines","SVM;body motion analysis;break dance movement;motion capture systems;motion data indexing;motion data similarity retrieval;principal components analysis;radio gymnastics;support vector machine","","1","","6","","","12-14 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method depends on the K-Means algorithm that is used for clustering. Our experiments show that the accuracy of detection of KBIDS increases exponentially with the number of clusters.

Compared with single model fully connected neural networks, NNTrees are more suitable for structural learning, and faster for decision making. To increase the realizability of the NNTrees, we have tried to induce more compact NNTrees through dimensionality reduction. So far, we have used principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction, and confirmed that in most cases the LDA based approach can result in very compact NNTrees without degrading the performance. One drawback in using the LDA based approach is that the cost for finding the transformation matrix can be very high for large databases. To solve this problem, in this paper we investigate the efficiency and efficacy of two centroid based approaches for NNTree induction. One is to map each datum directly to the class centroids; and the other is to find the least square error approximation of each datum using the centroids. Experimental results show that both approaches, although simple, are comparable to the LDA based approach in most cases.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:978-1-4244-2793-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5346091","Machine learning;decision tree;multivariate decision tree;neural network;pattern recognition","Biological neural networks;Costs;Cybernetics;Decision making;Decision trees;Least squares approximation;Linear discriminant analysis;Neural networks;Neurons;Principal component analysis","decision making;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;matrix algebra;neural nets;principal component analysis","NNTree;PCA;centroid based dimensionality reduction;decision making;large database;least square error approximation;linear discriminant analysis;machine learning;neural network tree induction;principal component analysis;structural learning;transformation matrix","","5","","14","","","11-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, a new score scheme is developed to measure the similarity between two representations. To verify the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted in four different protein data sets. We also classify SARS coronavirus to verify the effectiveness of the new method. Furthermore, preliminary results of fast classification of the whole CATH v2.5.1 database based on the new macrostructure similarity are given as a pilot study.

The convex-concave programming formulation is obtained by rewriting the weighted graph matching problem as a least-square problem on the set of permutation matrices and relaxing it to two different optimization problems: a quadratic convex and a quadratic concave optimization problem on the set of doubly stochastic matrices. The concave relaxation has the same global minimum as the initial graph matching problem, but the search for its global minimum is also a hard combinatorial problem. We, therefore, construct an approximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a convex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and concave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows to easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the optimization problem, and therefore, perform labeled weighted graph matching. The algorithm is compared with some of the best performing graph matching methods on four data sets: simulated graphs, QAPLib, retina vessel images, and handwritten Chinese characters.

Most previous studies have focused on designing special algorithms to effectively exploit the unlabeled data in conjunction with labeled data. Our goal is to improve the classification accuracy of any given supervised learning algorithm by using the available unlabeled examples. We call this as the Semi-supervised improvement problem, to distinguish the proposed approach from the existing approaches. We design a metasemi-supervised learning algorithm that wraps around the underlying supervised algorithm and improves its performance using unlabeled data. This problem is particularly important when we need to train a supervised learning algorithm with a limited number of labeled examples and a multitude of unlabeled examples. We present a boosting framework for semi-supervised learning, termed as SemiBoost. The key advantages of the proposed semi-supervised learning approach are: 1) performance improvement of any supervised learning algorithm with a multitude of unlabeled data, 2) efficient computation by the iterative boosting algorithm, and 3) exploiting both manifold and cluster assumption in training classification models. An empirical study on 16 different data sets and text categorization demonstrates that the proposed framework improves the performance of several commonly used supervised learning algorithms, given a large number of unlabeled examples.

Decision-making is essentially characterized behaviorally by the variability of the decision across individual trials - e.g., error and response time distributions. To infer the neural processes that govern decision-making requires identifying neural correlates of such trial-to-trial behavioral variability. In this paper, we review efforts that utilize signal processing and machine learning to enable single-trial analysis of neural signals acquired while subjects perform simple decision-making tasks. Our focus is on neuroimaging data collected noninvasively via electroencephalograpy (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We review the specific framework for extracting decision-relevant neural components from the neuroimaging data, the goal being to analyze the trial-to-trial variability of the neural signal along these component directions and to relate them to elements of the decision-making process. We review results for perceptual decision-making and discrimination tasks, including paradigms in which EEG variability is used to inform an fMRI analysis. We discuss how single-trial analysis reveals aspects of the underlying decision-making networks that are unobservable using traditional trial-averaging methods.","1937-3333;19373333","","10.1109/RBME.2009.2034535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5288606","Decision-making;electroencephalography;functional magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;single-trial analysis","Biological neural networks;Data analysis;Decision making;Electroencephalography;Humans;Machine learning;Magnetic analysis;Neuroimaging;Signal analysis;Signal processing","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology","EEG;behavioral variability;brain imaging;electroencephalograpy;fMRI;functional magnetic resonance imaging;image acquisition;machine learning;multivariate signal processing;neural correlates;neural networks;neural signal acquisition;neuroimaging;perceptual decision making;single-trial analysis","Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Decision Making;Discrimination (Psychology);Electroencephalography;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Nerve Net;Neuroimaging;Problem Solving;Reaction Time","13","","112","","20091016","2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using the sample to centralize the ratio of different kinds of goals can reflect various classifiers' prior probability. Using this parameter, we can make good use of AdaBoost algorithm to predict hazard quickly and will not cause the phenomenon of over studying. Based on the classification problem of two-classes, experiments with UCI datasets show the validity of the AdaBoost algorithm with prior probabilities.

Due to recent financial crises, credit risk analysis has been the major focus of financial and banking industry. An accurate estimation of credit risk could be transformed into a more efficient use of economic capital. Existing models for estimating credit risk are not semantics-based. The objective of this work was to design an intelligent Web portal to serve as service provider for credit risk analysis. The portal has been conceived to help users (e.g. credit managers working in banks) to detect bad payers. For this purpose, the knowledge of the financial domain has been represented by means of ontology, which has been used to guide the design of the application and to supply the system with semantic capabilities. The reasoning engine of the proposed system executes logic rules related with well-established financial variables. These rules characterize that a payer tends to become a bad one or not.","","POD:978-1-4244-4519-6","10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234452","credit rating;machine learning;ontologies","Engines;ISO standards;Laboratories;Logic;Ontologies;Portals;Programming;Risk analysis;Semantic Web;Vocabulary","credit transactions;financial management;inference mechanisms;ontologies (artificial intelligence);portals;risk analysis","banking industry;credit risk analysis;economic capital;financial crises;financial risk management;intelligent Web portal;knowledge representation;ontology-based portal;reasoning engine","","3","","31","","","8-11 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This set coincides with those satisfying three common assumptions about surrogates. Equivalent expressions for the members-sometimes well known-follow for convex and concave surrogates, frequently used in the induction of linear separators and decision trees. Most notably, they share remarkable algorithmic features: for each of these two types of classifiers, we give a minimization algorithm provably converging to the minimum of any such surrogate. While seemingly different, we show that these algorithms are offshoots of the same ldquomasterrdquo algorithm. This provides a new and broad unified account of different popular algorithms, including additive regression with the squared loss, the logistic loss, and the top-down induction performed in CART, C4.5.

The essence of dynamic texture is captured as the spatial relationship within the latent states. Moreover, Metropolis-Hastings sampling method is used to sample new states, which hold the spatio-temporal statistics of dynamic texture.

"A Boosting Framework for Visuality-Preserving Distance Metric Learning and Its Application to Medical Image Retrieval","L. Yang; R. Jin; L. Mummert; R. Sukthankar; A. Goode; B. Zheng; S. C. H. Hoi; M. Satyanarayanan","Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","20091120","2010","32","1","30","44","Similarity measurement is a critical component in content-based image retrieval systems, and learning a good distance metric can significantly improve retrieval performance. However, despite extensive study, there are several major shortcomings with the existing approaches for distance metric learning that can significantly affect their application to medical image retrieval. In particular, ldquosimilarityrdquo can mean very different things in image retrieval: resemblance in visual appearance (e.g., two images that look like one another) or similarity in semantic annotation (e.g., two images of tumors that look quite different yet are both malignant). Current approaches for distance metric learning typically address only one goal without consideration of the other. This is problematic for medical image retrieval where the goal is to assist doctors in decision making. In these applications, given a query image, the goal is to retrieve similar images from a reference library whose semantic annotations could provide the medical professional with greater insight into the possible interpretations of the query image. If the system were to retrieve images that did not look like the query, then users would be less likely to trust the system; on the other hand, retrieving images that appear superficially similar to the query but are semantically unrelated is undesirable because that could lead users toward an incorrect diagnosis. Hence, learning a distance metric that preserves both visual resemblance and semantic similarity is important. We emphasize that, although our study is focused on medical image retrieval, the problem addressed in this work is critical to many image retrieval systems. We present a boosting framework for distance metric learning that aims to preserve both visual and semantic similarities. The boosting framework first learns a binary representation using side information, in the form of labeled pairs, and then computes the distance as a weighted Hammi- - ng distance using the learned binary representation. A boosting algorithm is presented to efficiently learn the distance function.

The price hike was unexpected by many policy makers and individuals who were involved in the power industry. They have been wondering whether electricity deregulation produces benefits of competition promised to consumers. Unfortunately, no scientific research has previously examined why the electricity crisis occurred in California. Hence, this study proposes a use of multi-agent intelligent simulator to empirically examine several reasons regarding why it occurred. A proposed intelligent simulator has been developed on the basis of the knowledge-based reinforcement learning and is applied to a data set on the California electricity crisis in 2000-2001. The proposed simulator estimates accurately a dynamic fluctuation of electricity price and it provides empirical results that were not identified in the previous research by Joskow and Kahn (2002).","2159-3590;21593590","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2146-6; POD:978-1-4244-2145-9","10.1109/IEMC.2007.5235065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5235065","Machine learning;Multi-agent systems;Wholesale Power Market","Electricity supply industry deregulation;Energy consumption;Fluctuations;Learning;Power industry","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;power markets;power system simulation;pricing","California electricity crisis;dynamic fluctuation;electric power industry;electricity deregulation;knowledge-based reinforcement learning;multiagent intelligent simulator;policy maker;wholesale electricity price;wholesale power market","","0","","11","","","July 29 2007-Aug. 1 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the detection and tracking of multiple vehicles present in the field of view of a camera. Until now, the vehicle detection has been mainly performed by the widely used technique called background subtraction, which is based on detecting changes in an image sequence. While there has been long research on this technique, it still faces many challenges. We present in this paper a new framework to detect vehicles, based on a hierarchy of features detection and fusion. The first layer of the hierarchy extract image features. The next layer fuses image features to detect vehicle features such as headlights or windshields. A last layer fuses the vehicle features to detect a vehicle with more confidence. This approach is thus road illumination agnostic and allows vehicles to be detected day and night. The vehicle features are tracked over frames. We use a constant acceleration tracking model augmented with traffic-domain rules to handle the occlusions challenges.","2153-0009;21530009","POD:978-1-4244-5519-5","10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309837","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5309837","Traffic Monitoring;computer vision;headlights;hierarchical feature-based vehicle detection;machine learning;multiple vehicle detection;multiple vehicle tracking;vehicle appearance;windshields","Cameras;Computer vision;Computerized monitoring;Costs;Fuses;Image sensors;Image sequences;Surveillance;Vehicle detection;Vehicles","computer vision;feature extraction;image sensors;image sequences;object detection;road traffic;road vehicles;tracking;video cameras;video surveillance","background subtraction;computer vision;constant acceleration tracking model;image feature extraction;image sequence;multiple vehicle detection;road illumination agnostic;traffic-domain rules;vehicle features detection tracking;video camera;video traffic surveillance;video-based traffic monitoring","","18","2","14","","","4-7 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This requires configurable implementations of many algorithms, means to define and conduct meaningful experiments on them, and mechanisms for storing and analyzing observed performance data.In this paper, we first overview basic approaches for improving simulation performance and illustrate the challenges when comparing different methods.

The study in this paper uses demographic information, standard medical measurements, and features extracted from X-ray images to predict a patient's length of stay in ICU via rules extracted from decision trees generated by the CART algorithm. The X-ray features are extracted by using a spline/ASM segmentation technique to detect structure position, then calculating measures of displacement. The results are promising and compare well with SVM and C4.5 algorithms, indicating that the rules represent true data patterns.

In fact, it might be said that this notion of a feature value representation is a defining part of the CBR worldview-it underpins the idea of a problem space with cases located relative to each other in this space. Recently, a variety of similarity mechanisms have emerged that are not founded on this feature space idea. Some of these new similarity mechanisms have emerged in CBR research and some have arisen in other areas of data analysis. In fact, research on kernel-based learning is a rich source of novel similarity representations because of the emphasis on encoding domain knowledge in the kernel function.

Most machine learning methods in use today require the sequences to be of same length to successfully mine the binding motifs. We propose the use of time-based data mining methods in motif mining to be able to mine motifs position-independently.

Spatio-temporal data sets contain data objects that move in space over time. Traditional data clustering algorithms work well on static data sets that contain well separated clusters. Traditional techniques breakdown when they are applied to spatio-temporal data sets. They are not capable of tracking clusters when the moving objects intersect the space occupied by objects from another cluster. This work aims to improve the accuracy of traditional data clustering algorithms on spatio-temporal data sets. Many clustering algorithms create clusters based on the distance between the objects. We extend this distance measure to be a function of the position history of the objects. We show through a series of experiments that the use of the history based distance measures greatly improves the accuracy of existing data clustering algorithms on spatio-temporal data sets. In random data sets we achieve up to a 90% improvement in cluster accuracy. To evaluate the clustering algorithms we created 100 spatio-temporal data sets. We also defined a set of metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithms on the spatio-temporal data sets.","","POD:978-1-4244-5021-3","10.1109/ISCIS.2009.5291901","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5291901","Machine Learning;Spatio-Temporal Data Mining","Adaptive filters;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;History;Law enforcement;Monitoring;Object detection;Radiofrequency identification;Space technology;Tracking","data mining;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","adaptive history filtering;data clustering algorithm;moving objects clusters detection;moving objects clusters tracking;spatiotemporal data sets","","0","","25","","","14-16 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each agent of MP-Draughts is a neural network which learns almost without human supervision (distinctly from the world champion agent Chinook). MP-Draughts issues from a continuous activity of research whose previous product was the efficient agent VisionDraughts.

In order to try to reduce this misbehavior of the agent during endgames, MP-Draughts counts on 25 agents specialized for endgame phases, each one trained such as to be able to deal with a determined cluster of endgame board-states. These 25 clusters are mined by a Kohonen Network from a Data Base containing a large quantity of endgame board-states.

In classifying the visual textures, feature extraction for a given image involving wavelet decomposition is used to obtain the transformation coefficients. Feature vectors are formed using energy signature from each wavelet sub-band coefficient. We conducted an experiment to investigate the extent in which wavelet decomposition could be used in haptic texture search engine. The experimental result, based on different testing data, shows that feature extraction using wavelet decomposition achieve accuracy rate more than 96%. This demonstrates that wavelet decomposition and energy signature is effective in extracting information from a visual texture.

In this study, several new descriptors of evolutionary information have been developed and evaluated for sequence-based prediction of DNA and RNA-binding residues using support vector machines (SVMs). The new descriptors were shown to improve classifier performance. Interestingly, the best classifiers were obtained by combining the new descriptors and PSSM, suggesting that they captured different aspects of evolutionary information for DNA and RNA-binding site prediction. The SVM classifiers achieved 77.3% sensitivity and 79.3% specificity for prediction of DNA-binding residues, and 71.6% sensitivity and 78.7% specificity for RNA-binding site prediction.

The cause of this increase can be attributed to a variety of factors including global climatic change, an increase in global population, and a related increase in the use of lands more vulnerable to natural disaster events. Timely monitoring and warning of natural disaster events is critical to our ability to respond to and recover from these disasters. The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) is the next generation of environmental satellites to study the Earth and its climate. It will provide a significant increase in the ability to monitor and respond to disaster events by increasing temporal resolution and decreasing the timeline required for information to be accessible to ground stations. This paper will present an introduction to NPOESS and discuss its potential utility in natural disaster monitoring and response efforts in combination with state of the art data mining techniques. NPOESS is a constellation of low orbiting polar satellites capable of achieving near global coverage and is supplemented with a next generation METSAT capability. Its primary mission is the observation of Earth's land, ocean, and atmosphere, including the troposphere, stratosphere and the near space boundary. This system, due to come online in approximately 2013, will replace the United States' current constellation of environmental and weather satellites. NPOESS will revolutionize the way remote sensing is used in natural hazard monitoring and response efforts. It will allow simultaneous or near-simultaneous collection of atmospheric phenomena by multiple sensors. This capability will increase our understanding of atmospheric phenomena by reducing time between collections of data from multiple sensors and by providing a common platform for data distribution and analysis. The new sensor types flown in NPOESS will also- increase our collection capabilities. Increased data collection capability allows for advanced analysis of the atmosphere and will lead to better forecasting of natural hazard formation, development, and evolution. These increases in technical capability and bandwidth provide significantly more data for data mining algorithms. These algorithms have the ability to quickly interpret remotely sensed data and provide timely products to the natural disaster response community. While the NPOESS data provide a new testing ground for existing algorithms, it will also lead to the development of new algorithms driven by the need to efficiently exploit the volume of data produced by this system. The combination of new capabilities within NPOESS and the development of new advanced data mining applications will provide the disaster response community with the tools it needs to face the challenges of the new century.","2161-024X;2161024X","POD:978-1-4244-4562-2","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2009.5292934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5292934","Disaster;Machine Learning;NPOESS;Safety Net","Artificial satellites;Data mining;Earth;Hazards;Oceans;Remote monitoring;Satellite ground stations;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Space missions;Terrestrial atmosphere","artificial satellites;data mining;disasters;environmental factors;geophysics computing;remote sensing","AD 2013;NPOESS;National Polar Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System;data mining algorithms;data mining techniques;environmental satellites;low orbiting polar satellite constellation;natural disaster event monitoring;natural disaster event warning;natural disaster response;natural hazard monitoring;remote sensing;remotely sensed data intrepretation","","0","","10","","","12-14 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The issue is related to the stability of an EMG-based prosthesis control. Traditional EMG recognition systems receive EMG patterns and send them into classifiers directly, which generally results in unstable situations if the classes of some of the input EMG patterns are not included in the training of the classifiers. The EMG patterns whose class labels are not defined in the training phase are called non-target patterns. There should be a filter and this filter should be able to reject all non-target EMG patterns. As such, only target EMG patterns are fed into classifier, thus achieving a high-accuracy EMG classification. To this end, we propose in this paper a one-class classification-based non-target EMG pattern filtering scheme. By introducing a novel one-class classifier, called support vector data description (SVDD), into the filtering scheme, the goal mentioned above can easily be achieved. SVDD is a powerful machine learning technique. It can be built on a single class and find a flexible boundary to enclose the target class by using the so-called kernel trick. In experiments, we will show that if the filtering scheme is not performed, the traditional EMG classification system suffers from unstable situations. Contrarily, the whole classification system will achieve satisfactory and stable performance no matter what the input EMG patterns are target or non-target ones, if the proposed filtering scheme is embedded.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:978-1-4244-2793-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346086","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5346086","Electromyography (EMG) recognition;machine learning;one-class classification;prosthesis control;support vector data description","Control systems;Electromyography;Filtering;Filters;Mechanical engineering;Pattern recognition;Prosthetics;Stability;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","electromyography;filtering theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;prosthetics;signal classification;support vector machines","SVDD;electromyography recognition;high-stability EMG recognition system;machine learning technique;nontarget EMG pattern filtering scheme;prosthesis control;signal classification;support vector data description;training phase","","2","","32","","","11-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An automatic bug triage system may reduce the software maintenance time and improve its quality by correct and timely assignment of new bug reports to the appropriate developers. In this paper, we present the techniques behind an automatic bug triage system, which is based on the categorization of bug reports. In order to obtain an automatic bug triage system we used these techniques and performed comparative experiments. We downloaded 1,983 resolved bug reports along with the developer activity data from the Mozilla open source project. We extracted the relevant features like report title, report summary etc., from each bug report, and extracted developer's name who resolved the bug reports from the developers activity data. We processed the extracted textual data, and obtained the term-to-document matrix using parsing, filtering and term weighting methods. For term weighting methods we used simple term frequency and TFtimesIDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) methods. Furthermore, we reduced the dimensionality of the obtained term-to-document matrix by applying feature selection and latent semantic indexing methods.

The coprocessor architecture, targeted at both SVM training and classification, is based on clusters of vector processing elements (VPEs) operating in single-instruction multiple data (SIMD) mode to take advantage of large amounts of data parallelism in the application. We use the FPGA's DSP elements as parallel multiply-accumulators (MACs), a core computation in SVMs. A key feature of the architecture is that it is customized to low precision arithmetic which permits one DSP unit to perform two or more MACs in parallel. Low precision also reduces the required number of parallel off-chip memory accesses by packing multiple data words on the FPGA-memory bus. We have built a prototype using an off-the-shelf PCI-based FPGA card with a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA and 1 GB DDR2 memory. For SVM training, we observe application-level end-to-end computation speeds of over 9 billion multiply-accumulates per second (GMACs). For SVM classification, using data packing, the application speed increases to 14 GMACs. The FPGA-based system is about 20times faster than a dual Opteron 2.2 GHz processor CPU, and dissipates around 10 W of power.","","POD:978-0-7695-3716-0","10.1109/FCCM.2009.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290941","FPGAs;Hardware Acceleration;Machine Learning;Parallel Architectures;Support Vector Machines","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Coprocessors;Digital signal processing;Field programmable gate arrays;Layout;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","coprocessors;field programmable gate arrays;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel architectures;peripheral interfaces;support vector machines;vector processor systems","DDR2 memory;DSP unit;FPGA memory bus;SVM;Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA;coprocessor architecture;data packing;data parallelism;dual Opteron 2.2 GHz processor CPU;end-to-end computation;low precision arithmetic;machine learning algorithm;massively parallel FPGA-based coprocessor;off-the-shelf PCI based FPGA card;parallel multiply-accumulators;parallel off-chip memory access;recognized scenes analysis;scene learning;sementics analysis;single-instruction multiple data;support vector machine training;vector processing elements","","27","","18","","","5-7 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Novel computational method is highly needed to help biologist design experiment. In this paper, we are motivated to propose a novel machine learning model for predicting Gram-positive protein subcelluar localization, as an alternative to the existing models Gpos-PLoc when the required GO annotation information is unavailable. The model uses protein structural domain as indicator of protein subcelluar location. To capture protein sequence local information and structural domain boundary partition information, a novel method called multiple instance multiclass learning (MIMC) is proposed for predicting protein subcelluar location, where domain is taken as an instance of protein and protein as a bag of domains. Because some proteins may have multiple subcelluar locations, we introduce another related model called multiple instance multiple label learning (MIML) to predict potential minor subcelluar locations. Protein sequence and domain are encoded using simple 20-D amino acid composition (AA), so that feature dimensionality is greatly reduced and the instance representation can capture domain boundary partition information as compared to flat domain vector representation. Experiments show that simple AA representation outperforms order-based Pseudo Amino Acid (PseAA) representation, and MIMC model performs comparably to Choupsilas OET-NN ensemble (Gpos-PLoc),the only machine learning model for Gram-positive protein subcelluar location prediction thus far, to the best of our knowledge.","","POD:978-0-7695-3739-9","10.1109/IJCBS.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5260695","machine learning;multiple instance learning;multiple instance multiple label learning;protein domain;protein subcelluar location","Amino acids;Biological information theory;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Laboratories;Machine learning;Microorganisms;Predictive models;Protein sequence;Sequences","cellular biophysics;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;proteins","20-D amino acid composition;GO annotation information;Gram-positive bacterial protein;computational method;machine learning model;multiple instance multiclass learning;multiple instance multiple label learning;protein sequence;protein sequence local information;protein structural domain;structural domain boundary partition information;subcellular localization","","1","","27","","","3-5 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The input to a binary supervised classifier consists normally of positive and negative examples, but usually the only available information are a partial set of gene regulations, i.e. positive examples, and unlabeled data which could include both positive and negative examples. A fundamental challenge is the choice of negative examples from such unlabeled data to make the classifier able to learn from data.

One of the design issues in SVM classifier is reducing the number of support vectors without compromising the classification accuracy. In this paper, a novel technique which requires only a subset of the support vectors is proposed. The subset is obtained by including only those support vectors for which Lagrange multiplier is greater than a threshold. In order to find the subset which yields the highest classification accuracy with the least number of support vectors in the subset, the recognition performance corresponding to subsets with different threshold values are to be evaluated and compared. The proposed technique is applied for SVM based isolated digit recognition system and is studied using speaker dependent as well as multispeaker dependent TI46 database of isolated digits. Two feature extraction techniques, one using LPC and another using MFCC are applied to the speech from the above database and the features are mapped using SOFM. This in turn is used by the SVM classifier to evaluate the recognition accuracy. The proposed technique is applied to one-against-all (OAA) scheme and is denoted as modified one-against-all (M-OAA) approach in this paper. Based on this study, it is found that for MFCC feature input, the proposed M-OAA based SVM classifier approach results in reduction of support vectors by a factor of 1.86 to 18.3 with no compromise in recognition accuracy. For LPC feature input, the M-OAA based SVM classifier results in reduction of support vectors by a factor of 1.59 to 2.52 without any compromise in recognition accuracy for some cases and with a maximum of 1% degradation in recognition accuracy for some cases. The proposed approach is also applicable for other schemes such as half-against-half (HAH) and directed acyclic graphs (DAG) based SVM classifiers as well as for any other classification problem such as face recognition, - fingerprint recognition, target recognition, speaker recognition and speaker verification.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:978-1-4244-2793-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5346200","Isolated Digit Recognition;Machine Learning;OAA;Pattern Recognition;SVM;Support Vectors","Degradation;Feature extraction;Lagrangian functions;Linear predictive coding;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Pattern classification;Spatial databases;Speech;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","feature extraction;self-organising feature maps;set theory;signal classification;speaker recognition;support vector machines","DAG;HAH scheme;LPC;Lagrange multiplier;M-OAA SVM classifier scheme;MFCC;SOFM;SVM-based isolated digit recognition system;directed acyclic graph;face recognition;feature extraction technique;fingerprint recognition;half-against-half scheme;linear pattern classification;modified one-against-all support vector machine scheme;multispeaker dependent TI46 database;nonlinear pattern classification;speaker dependent database;speaker recognition;speaker verification;speech recognition;state-of-the-art tool;support vector subset;target recognition;threshold value","","10","","24","","","11-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The error estimator is trained to optimize the area under the word error ROC leading to an improved efficiency of the human correction process.

Due to the present state of technology, radiologists must opt to increase sensitivity and rely on follow-up diagnostic procedures to rule out the incurred false positives. There is evidence in published reports that computer-aided diagnosis technology may help radiologists alter the benefit-cost calculus of CT sensitivity and specificity in lung cancer screening protocols.
