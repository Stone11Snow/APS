However, obtaining reliable labels is challenging due to several reasons, such as noisy annotators, limited budget and so on. The state-of-the-art approaches, either suffer in some noisy scenarios, or rely on unlimited resources to acquire reliable labels. In this article, we adopt the learning with expert~(AKA worker in crowdsourcing) advice framework to robustly infer accurate labels by considering the reliability of each worker. However, in order to accurately predict the reliability of each worker, traditional learning with expert advice will consult with external oracles~(AKA domain experts) on the true label of each instance. To reduce the cost of consultation, we proposed two active learning approaches, margin-based and weighted difference of advices based. Meanwhile, to address the problem of limited annotation budget, we proposed a reliability-based assigning approach which actively decides who to annotate the next instance based on each worker's cumulative performance. The experimental results both on real and simulated datasets show that our algorithms can achieve robust and promising performance both in the normal and noisy scenarios with limited budget.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9618-9; POD:978-1-4673-9619-6","10.1109/WI-IAT.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397306","Active Learning;Crowdsourcing;Online Learning","Crowdsourcing;Electronic mail;Labeling;Machine learning algorithms;Noise measurement;Robustness","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence)","active crowdsourcing;annotation;reliability-based assigning approach","","","","30","","","6-9 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The issue is that the sole feature space can't exploit the relationship of source domain and target domain fully. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes a transfer learning method that uses deep learning to extract hierarchical feature spaces, so knowledge of source domain can be exploited and transferred in multiple feature spaces with different levels of abstraction. In the experiment, the effectiveness of transfer learning in multiple feature spaces is compared and this can help us find the optimal feature space for transfer learning.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9323-2; POD:978-1-4673-9324-9","10.1109/ISKE.2015.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383046","deep learning;feature extraction;transfer learning","Data models;Feature extraction;Learning systems;Machine learning;Noise reduction;Predictive models;Training","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","deep neural network;feature space classification;hierarchical feature space extraction;source domain;target domain;transfer learning method","","","","17","","","24-27 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, the demand on customized pattern recognition within personal devices will grow gradually as more deep learning applications will be developed. This paper presents a SoC implementation to enable deep learning applications to run with low cost platforms such as mobile or portable devices. Different from conventional works which have adopted massively-parallel architecture, this work adopts task-flexible architecture and exploits multiple parallelism to cover complex functions of convolutional deep belief network which is one of popular deep learning/inference algorithms.

The predictive model that we learn can signal coinciding stress with an aggregated index at bank or European level, while crucially allowing for automatic extraction of text descriptions of the events, based on passages with high stress levels.

To accomplish the task, a hierarchical oil tank detector with deep surrounding features is proposed in this paper. The surrounding features extracted by the deep learning model aim at making the oil tanks more easily to recognize, since the appearance of oil tanks is a circle and this information is not enough to separate targets from the complex background. The proposed method is divided into three modules: 1) candidate selection; 2) feature extraction; and 3) classification. First, a modified ellipse and line segment detector (ELSD) based on gradient orientation is used to select candidates in the image. Afterward, the feature combing local and surrounding information together is extracted to represent the target. Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) which can reliably capture the shape information is extracted to characterize the local patch. For the surrounding area, the convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 (ILSVRC2012) contest is applied as a blackbox feature extractor to extract rich surrounding feature. Then, the linear support vector machine (SVM) is utilized as the classifier to give the final output.

The challenge is that the inaccurate definitions of code smells make developers disagree whether a piece of code is a smell or not, consequently, making difficult creation of a universal detection solution able to recognize smells in different software projects. Several works have been proposed to identify code smells but they still report inaccurate results and use techniques that do not present to developers a comprehensive explanation how these results have been obtained.

For this, it was applied in a dataset containing 4 open source projects and the results were compared with the manual oracle, with existing detection approaches and with other machine learning algorithms.

First, a set of algorithms are run on a benchmark problem suite. Given a new problem, a default algorithm is run and its convergence characteristics are recorded. This is used to map to the problem database to find the most similar problem. In turn, the database returns the best algorithm for this problem and this algorithm is run in the second iteration and so on, aiming to home onto the most suitable algorithm for the problem.

To avoid such drawbacks, we take a different approach and propose HyperX, which is a thin layer built upon Spark. To preserve the problem size, HyperX directly operates on a distributed hypergraph. To reduce the replicas, HyperX replicates the vertices but not the hyperedges. To balance the workloads, we investigate the hypergraph partitioning problem aiming at minimizing the space and the communication cost subject to two separate constraints on the hyperedge and the vertex workloads.

Firstly, we use word segmentation system (LTP) to segment sentence, and classify words according to annotating elements in CEC2.0 corpus, and then obtain each word's vectorization of multiple features, which include part of speech, dependency grammar, length, location. We obtain word's deep semantic characteristics from the collection after vectorization using deep belief network, finally, object elements are classified and recognized. Extensive testing analysis shows that our proposed method can achieve better recognition effect.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9323-2; POD:978-1-4673-9324-9","10.1109/ISKE.2015.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383058","CEORM;DBN;deep learning;event ontology;event recognition","Feature extraction;Grammar;Machine learning;Object oriented modeling;Object recognition;Semantics;Training","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;object recognition","CEC2.0 corpus;CEORM model;Chinese emergency object recognition model;LTP;action element;assertion element;deep belief network;deep semantic characteristics;environment element;event ontology;language performance element;object element;rule learning;shallow machine learning;statistical learning;time element;word segmentation system","","","","10","","","24-27 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This uncertainty can be distributed evenly or into certain areas of feature space. In regular classification tasks, the uncertainty can be estimated from posterior probabilities. On the other hand, if the data set contains missing values, not all classifiers can be used directly. Imputing missing values solves this problem but it suppresses variation in the data leading to underestimation of uncertainty and can also bias the results. Multiple imputation, where several copies of the data set are created, solves these problems but the classical approach for uncertainty estimation does not generalize to this case. Thus in this paper we propose a novel algorithm to estimate classification uncertainty with multiple imputed data. We show that the algorithm performs as well as the benchmark algorithm with a classifier that supports classification with missing values. It also supports the use of any classifier, even if it does not support classification with missing values, as long as it supports the estimation of posterior probabilities.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7560-0; POD:978-1-4799-7561-7","10.1109/SSCI.2015.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7376605","","Analytical models;Correlation;Data handling;Data models;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Uncertainty","pattern classification;probability","classification model;classification uncertainty estimation;imputed data classification;multiple imputation;posterior probability estimation","","1","","15","","","7-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we consider the problem setting motivated by the task of splice site prediction. For this task, annotating a genome using machine learning requires a lot of labeled data, whereas for non-model organisms, there is only some labeled data and lots of unlabeled data. With domain adaptation one can leverage the large amount of data from a related model organism, along with the labeled and unlabeled data from the organism of interest to train a classifier for the latter. Our goal is to analyze the three ways of incorporating the unlabeled data - with soft labels only (i.e., Expectation-Maximization), with hard labels only (i.e., self-training), or with both soft and hard labels - for the splice site prediction in particular, and more broadly for a general iterative domain adaptation setting. We provide empirical results on splice site prediction indicating that using soft labels only can lead to better classifier compared to the other two ways.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3854-7; POD:978-1-5090-2094-2","10.1145/2808797.2808809","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403675","","Algorithm design and analysis;DNA;Machine learning algorithms;Organisms;Prediction algorithms;Social network services;Training","bioinformatics;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","classifier;genome annotation;iterative domain adaptation algorithm;machine learning;nonmodel organisms;self-training styles;splice site prediction","","","","19","","","25-28 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection of masses from mammograms is considered to be a challenging problem due to their large variation in shape, size, boundary and texture and also because of their low signal to noise ratio compared to the surrounding breast tissue. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting masses in mammograms using a cascade of deep learning and random forest classifiers. The first stage classifier consists of a multi-scale deep belief network that selects suspicious regions to be further processed by a two-level cascade of deep convolutional neural networks. The regions that survive this deep learning analysis are then processed by a two-level cascade of random forest classifiers that use morphological and texture features extracted from regions selected along the cascade. Finally, regions that survive the cascade of random forest classifiers are combined using connected component analysis to produce state-of-the-art results. We also show that the proposed cascade of deep learning and random forest classifiers are effective in the reduction of false positive regions, while maintaining a high true positive detection rate. We tested our mass detection system on two publicly available datasets: DDSM-BCRP and INbreast. The final mass detection produced by our approach achieves the best results on these publicly available datasets with a true positive rate of 0.96 ± 0.03 at 1.2 false positive per image on INbreast and true positive rate of 0.75 at 4.8 false positive per image on DDSM-BCRP.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6795-0; POD:978-1-4673-6796-7","10.1109/DICTA.2015.7371234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371234","","Breast cancer;Feature extraction;Image resolution;Machine learning;Mammography;Support vector machines","belief networks;biological tissues;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical image processing;neural nets;object detection;principal component analysis;trees (mathematics)","DDSM-BCRP;INbreast;automated mass detection;boundary variation;breast tissue;cascaded deep learning;connected component analysis;deep convolutional neural network;false positive region reduction;mammogram;mass classification;mass segmentation;morphological feature extraction;multiscale deep belief network;random forest classifier;shape variation;signal to noise ratio;size variation;texture feature extraction;texture variation","","2","","37","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to show the full potential of automatically deception detection, in this paper, we first construct the deceptive and non-deceptive Chinese speech corpus which has not been published so far. And then we propose a novel machine learning-based approach to detect deception in the same gender. Several popular machine learning algorithms are applied. Moreover, a transfer learning-based algorithm is applied for cross-gender deception detection. Experimental results show that our approach performs well on real-world corpus. In intra-gender deception detection, our approach can achieve roughly the same accuracy as the traditional method on English corpus.

Traditional scene classification problems were solved by utilizing the spatial, spectral and structural features of the HSR images separately or jointly, which lacks considering all those features of the images integrally and automatically. In this paper, we propose an efficient hierarchical convolutional sparse auto-encoder (HCSAE) algorithm considering all the features of the images integrally for scene classification, which adopts the unsupervised hierarchical idea based on the single-hierarchy convolutional sparse auto-encoder (CSAE). Compared with the single-hierarchy CSAE, HCSAE can extract more robust and efficient features containing abundant detail and structural information in the higher hierarchy for scene classification. To further improve the calculation performance and reduce the over-fitting of the network, a “dropout” strategy is adopted in this paper.

Deep belief network consists of multi layers of restricted Boltzmann machine(RBM) and a deep auto-encoder, which uses a stack architecture learning feature layer by layer. The learning rule is that one deeper layer learns more complex representations, which are the high level features of the input data, from the representations learnt by the layer before. Fuzzy C-Means(FCM) is one of the most popular clustering algorithms, which allows one piece of data belong to several clusters. In this paper the authors propose a novel clustering model, and introduce a novel clustering technique(DBNOC) which combines deep belief network and fuzzy c-means. The main idea is that: first, it clusters with the high level representations learnt by stacked RBM to produce the initial cluster center, then it uses the fine-tune step including one center holding clustering algorithm and deep auto-encoder to optimize the cluster center and membership between input data and every cluster by cross iteration. The authors use FCM clustering algorithm to fulfill the model and do experiment on both low dimensional datasets and high dimensional datasets. The experiment results suggest that the proposed deep belief network oriented clustering method is better than the standard K-Means and FCM algorithm on the test datasets. Even on high dimensional datasets, the DBNOC clustering method show more generalization. What's more, the proposed model is suitable both in theoretical and practical.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9323-2; POD:978-1-4673-9324-9","10.1109/ISKE.2015.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383025","clustering;deep belief network;deep learning;fuzzy c-means;unsupervised learning","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Data models;Machine learning;Neural networks;Training;Unsupervised learning","Boltzmann machines;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern clustering","DBNOC;FCM algorithm;RBM;cluster center optimization;deep autoencoder;deep belief network oriented clustering;deep learning;fuzzy c-means algorithm;membership optimization;restricted Boltzmann machine","","","","17","","","24-27 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the higher level, the algorithm takes as input the combination of the output from these models and extracts the model about the Human Activity Detection. This flexible and modular hierarchical algorithm detects more complex activities (than usually in the state of the art), under broader smartphone configurations (position, orientation).

The method is based on a modified convolutional neural networks (CNN), named network-in-network (NIN), which has shown a good performance in some computer vision tasks. However, applying NIN to some specific applications may encounter a few problems. First, the NIN removes the fully connected layers, which makes it unsuited to use in large-scale face recognition due to lack of an efficient feature representation, even though it brings a lot of performance benefits. Second, some lowerlayer features, which can make the feature representation more discriminative, is unused. In the pure forward architecture, these features are unseen to the classifier. To solve the two problems, we present a multi-scale receptive fields (MSRF) representation learning scheme. Based on a well trained NIN, we add a pathway to top layer and design a feature vector as final representation. In our experiments, we compare the result of our multi-scale receptive fields with standard NIN architecture. The results show our method can obtain a more explicit feature representation and improvements in performance.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7678-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-7679-2; POD:978-1-4673-7680-8","10.1109/ICNC.2015.7377959","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377959","deep learning;multi-scale features;objection recognition;receptive field learning","Computer architecture;Convolution;Convolutional codes;Machine learning;Multilayer perceptrons;Training","computer vision;feature extraction;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;object recognition;performance evaluation","MSRF representation learning scheme;NIN architecture;classifier;computer vision;convolutional neural networks;feature representation learning;feature vector;large-scale face recognition;lower-layer features;modified CNN;multiscale receptive fields;network-in-network;objection recognition;performance improvements","","","","19","","","15-17 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The tumor movements pertaining to respiration are divided into intra-fractional variation occurring in a single treatment session and inter-fractional variation arising between different sessions. Most studies of patients' respiration movements deal with intra-fractional variation. Previous studies on inter-fractional variation are hardly mathematized and cannot predict movements well due to inconstant variation. Moreover, the computation time of the prediction should be reduced. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new predictor for intra- and inter-fractional data variation, called intra- and inter-fraction fuzzy deep learning (IIFDL), where FDL, equipped with breathing clustering, predicts the movement accurately and decreases the computation time. Through the experimental results, we validated that the IIFDL improved root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 29.98% and prediction overshoot by 70.93%, compared with existing methods. The results also showed that the IIFDL enhanced the average RMSE and overshoot by 59.73% and 83.27%, respectively. In addition, the average computation time of IIFDL was 1.54 ms for both intra- and inter-fractional variation, which was much smaller than the existing methods. Therefore, the proposed IIFDL might achieve real-time estimation as well as better tracking techniques in radiotherapy.","2168-2372;21682372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2016.2516005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377034","Fuzzy deep learning;breathing prediction;inter-fractional variation;intra-fractional variation;tumor tracking","Artificial neural networks;Cancer;Lungs;Machine learning;Predictive models;Training;Tumors","feature extraction;fuzzy logic;fuzzy neural nets;lung;medical signal processing;pattern clustering;pneumodynamics;radiation therapy;tumours","breathing clustering;fuzzy deep learning;interfractional variation prediction;intrafractional variation prediction;lung tumors;radiotherapy;respiration movements;root-mean-square error;tumor tracking","","1","","43","","20160108","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the constructed hypergraph, the weight between two vertices in a hyperedge is incorporated, and it can be measured by their affinity in the corresponding visual concept. A ranking scheme is designed to compute the association scores of images and the relevance scores of visual concepts by employing input query vectors to handle image retrieval. In the scheme, the association and relevance scores are determined by an iterative method to solve limiting probabilities of a multi-dimensional Markov chain arising from the constructed hypergraph. The convergence analysis of the iteration method is studied and analyzed. Moreover, a learning algorithm is also proposed to set the parameters in the scheme, which makes it simple to use. Experimental results on the MSRC, Corel, and Caltech256 data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper proposes a deep computation model for feature learning on big data, which uses a tensor to model the complex correlations of heterogeneous data. To fully learn the underlying data distribution, the proposed model uses the tensor distance as the average sum-of-squares error term of the reconstruction error in the output layer. To train the parameters of the proposed model, the paper designs a high-order back-propagation algorithm (HBP) by extending the conventional back-propagation algorithm from the vector space to the high-order tensor space. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we carried out the experiments on four representative datasets by comparison with stacking auto-encoders and multimodal deep learning models.

The underlying mechanism is based on a layered structure called the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). Researchers have been reporting software and hardware implementation of the HTM, with different levels of success. This paper presents a pattern recognition system based on Hawkins' concept of simple concatenation, where decisions are made based on the processing of information in a hierarchical array of cells. A two-layer network recognizing 32×32 pixel patterns was used as a proof of concept. In this implementation patterns on the upper layer are activated by concatenating patterns presented on the lower layer. The input pattern is analysed in the lower layer by moving a coincidence array. Outputs from the lower layer are fed to the higher layer where they are analysed with a bigger coincidence array. The results in this paper were obtained using a set of seven patterns. One of the patterns was used as a sample or learnt pattern, and the rest of the patterns were used for testing. The efficacy of the network was measured using the percentage of similarity between testing patterns and the learnt pattern. Two different ways of moving the coincidence array were explored. The first method moves the coincidence array by its size, and the second moves the coincidence array by one pixel at a time. For validation, results were also compared to the existing k-nn algorithm and human classification. Moving the coincidence array by one pixel produced a percentage of similarity closer to the results of k-nn, while moving the coincidence array by its size produced a classification closer to the human perception.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8773-3; POD:978-1-4799-8774-0; USB:978-1-4799-8772-6","10.1109/IC3INA.2015.7377756","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377756","coincidence array;hierarchy;layer","Arrays;Australia;Computers;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition;Software;Testing","image recognition","HTM;coincidence array;hierarchical concatenation;hierarchical temporal memory;learnt pattern;pattern recognition system;testing patterns;two-layer network","","","","6","","","5-7 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their popularity is due to their ability to achieve higher accuracy than conventional machine learning in many research areas such as speech recognition, image processing and natural language processing. Deep learning algorithms rely on multiple cascaded layers of non-linear processing units, typically composed of hidden artificial neural networks for feature extraction and transformation. However, deep learning algorithms require a large amount of computational power and significant amount of time to train. Fortunately, the training and inference algorithms of deep learning architectures expose abundant data-parallelism. We aim in this work to develop technology that exploits deep learning data parallelism in 2 ways: 1) by distributing deep computation into a Hadoop cluster or cloud of computing nodes, and 2) by using field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) hardware acceleration to speed up computationally intensive deep learning kernels. In this paper, we describe a hardware prototype of our accelerated Hadoop deep learning system architecture and report initial performance and energy reduction results. By accelerating the convolutional layers of deep learning Convolutional Neural Network, we have observed a potential speed-up of 12.6 times and an energy reduction of 87.5% on a 6-node FPGA accelerated Hadoop cluster.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8493-3; POD:978-1-4673-8494-0","10.1109/ICDMW.2015.148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395718","FPGA;Hadoop;convolutional neural network;deep learning;map-reduce","Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Machine learning;Neural networks;Training","data handling;feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;parallel processing;software architecture","FPGA-accelerated Hadoop cluster;convolutional neural network;deep learning architectures;deep learning computations;deep learning data parallelism;feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;hidden artificial neural networks;inference algorithms;machine learning;nonlinear processing units;transformation","","","","37","","","14-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Deep learning is a new area of machine learning research that has gained increasing attention in artificial intelligence. In this study, we propose to associate the features from the static analysis with features from dynamic analysis of Android apps and characterize malware using deep learning techniques. We implement an online deep-learning-based Android malware detection engine (DroidDetector) that can automatically detect whether an app is a malware or not. With thousands of Android apps, we thoroughly test DroidDetector and perform an indepth analysis on the features that deep learning essentially exploits to characterize malware. The results show that deep learning is suitable for characterizing Android malware and especially effective with the availability of more training data. DroidDetector can achieve 96.76% detection accuracy, which outperforms traditional machine learning techniques.

At the other extreme, another 10% or so enjoy disease-free survival of three years or more [1]. At present there are more than a dozen prognostic signatures that claim to predict the survival prospects of a patient based on her genetic profile. Yet, according to [2], none of these signatures performs significantly better than pure guessing. Accordingly, in this paper the objective is to propose and validate another gene-based signature. TCGA ovarian cancer data is analyzed using the “lone star” algorithm [3] that is specifically developed for identifying a small number of highly predictive features from a very large set. Using this algorithm, we are able to identify a biomarker panel of 25 genes (out of 12,000) that can be used to classify patients into one of three groups: super-responders (SR), medium responders (MR), and non-responders (NR). We are also able to determine a discriminant function that can divide patients into two classes, such that there is a clear survival advantage of one group over the other. This signature is developed using the TCGA Agilent platform data, and cross-validated on the TCGA Affymetrix platform data, as well as entirely independent data due to Tothill et al. [4].

Nowadays donor safety is major issue as blood is collected from different donors. Small amount of donors face reactions after donating blood and if not treated on time then it may lead to serious injury. The reactions that occur in the donor during blood donation at different hospitals and blood banks is collected, organized and analyzed by the DonorHART tool [1, 3]. The donor reactions information are captured and analyzed by DonorHART system[1]. The tool also monitors and researches the risks involved for donors at the time of blood donation or after the donation process. Data mining makes an effort to reveal the patterns in data that are difficult to detect and recognize with automatic pattern recognition. It is analyzing of data and then summarizing it into different form which is called as information and is taken from different databases.

However, in arid-to-semiarid regions, such as Iraq, accurate discrimination of different vegetation types is challenging due to their similar spectral responses. Moreover, Iraq has been subjected to major disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic which have affected the distribution of land cover types through space and time. Reliable information about croplands and natural vegetation in such regions is generally scarce. This research aimed to develop a phenology-based classification approach using support vector machines for the assessment of space-time distribution of the dominant vegetation land cover (VLC) types in Iraq, particularly croplands, from 2002 to 2012. Thirteen successive years of 8-day composites of MODISNDVI data at a spatial resolution of 250 m were employed to estimate 11 phenological parameters. The classification methodology was assessed using reference samples taken from fine spatial resolution imagery and independent testing data obtained through fieldwork. Overall accuracies were generally >85 %, with relatively high Kappa coefficients (>0.86) across the classified land cover types. The predicted cropland class area and the Global MODIS land cover product were compared with ground statistical data at the governorate level, revealing a significantly larger coefficient of determination for the present phenology-based approach (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.70 against R<sup>2</sup> = 0.33 for MODIS, p<; 0.05). The resulting maps delimit for the first time, at a fine spatial resolution, the spatial and interannual variability in the dominant VLC classes across Iraq.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2508639","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373523","Classification;Iraq;monitoring;phenology;time-series","Agriculture;Land surface;MODIS;Machine learning algorithms;Remote sensing;Support vector machines;Vegetation mapping","land cover;support vector machines;vegetation;vegetation mapping","AD 2002 to 2012;Iraq;Kappa coefficient;MODISNDVI data;arid-to-semiarid region;climate change impact;cropland;dominant vegetation land cover;fine spatial resolution imagery;food insecurity;global MODIS land cover product;ground statistical data;independent testing data;land cover distribution;land cover monitoring;moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer;normalized difference vegetation index;phenology-based classification approach;satellite-based phenological parameters;space-time VLC distribution;support vector machine;sustainable agricultural intensification;vegetation classification;vegetation type","","","","74","","20160106","Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Firstly, an adaptive time series segmentation method was proposed. Then, a large margin based feature segment selection method was given. Based on these two methods, a time series classification framework was established after representing the time series with the optimal segments.

To further improve the search, recent publications propose transferring knowledge from previous experiments to new experiments. We adapt the sequential model-based optimization by replacing its surrogate model and acquisition function with one policy that is optimized for the task of hyperparameter tuning. This policy generalizes over previous experiments but neither uses a model nor uses meta-features, nevertheless, outperforms the state of the art. We show that a static ranking of hyperparameter combinations yields competitive results and substantially outperforms a random hyperparameter search. Thus, it is a fast and easy alternative to complex hyperparameter tuning strategies and allows practitioners to tune their hyperparameters by simply using a look-up table. We made look-up tables for two classifiers publicly available: SVM and AdaBoost. Furthermore, we propose a similarity measure for data sets that yields more comprehensible results than those using meta-features. We show how this similarity measure can be applied to surrogate models in the SMBO framework and empirically show that this change leads to better hyperparameter configurations in less trials.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-1-4673-9504-5; POD:978-1-4673-9505-2","10.1109/ICDM.2015.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373431","hyperparameter optimization;meta-learning;transfer learning","Adaptation models;Data models;Loss measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization;Tuning","pattern classification;support vector machines","AdaBoost;SMBO framework;SVM;acquisition function;automatic tuning;classifiers;complex hyperparameter tuning strategies;data sets;hyperparameter combinations;hyperparameter configurations;look-up tables;meta-features;random hyperparameter search;sequential model-based optimization;sequential model-free hyperparameter tuning;static ranking;surrogate models","","2","","21","","","14-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The stable and unstable classes are expected to be exactly correct. Moreover, an SVM solver for large scale problem is designed based on sequential minimal optimization (SMO).

Moreover, the number of the hidden layer's neuron decreases layer-by-layer to eliminate the redundant information of the input data and accelerate the detection speed combining with the skin color detection.

First, each type of semantic features (e.g., human action trajectories) is fed into a corresponding multi-layer feature abstraction pathway, followed by a fusion layer connecting all the different pathways. Second, the correlations of how the semantic cues interacting with each other are learned in an unsupervised cross-modality autoencoder fashion. Finally, by fine-tuning a large-margin objective deployed on this deep architecture, we are able to answer the question on how the semantic cues of who, what, and where compose a complex event. As compared with the traditional feature fusion methods (e.g., various early or late strategies), our method jointly learns the essential higher level features that are most effective for fusion and recognition.

In this paper, we extend the PReSET toolset to allow the investigation, comparison and analysis of algorithms for anomaly traffic classification based on machine learning. PReSET was designed to allow the simulation-based evaluation of resilience strategies, thus enabling the comparison of optimal configurations and policies for combating different types of attacks (e.g., DDoS attacks, worms) and other anomalies. In such resilience strategies, policies written in the Ponder2 language can be used to activate/reconfigure traffic classification modules and other mechanisms (e.g., traffic shaping), depending on monitored results in the simulation environment.

One way to optimize these properties is feature selection. Computational cost and model size can be reduced by discarding features with low relevance. Furthermore, feature selection can provide a deeper understanding of the feature's importance. This work focuses on the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance algorithm (mRMR) which is a filter-method for feature selection that uses pair wise mutual information as a measure to decide which feature is relevant. The algorithm is initialized with the feature with the highest relevance according to the measure and an iterative algorithm selects the next feature which optimizes for a high relevance while maintaining a low redundancy to the previously selected features. This work extensively studies distinct feature sets which can be generated when running the mRMR algorithm multiple times using features of descending relevance as initialization. By exploiting information about the order in which the iterative algorithm chooses the features in the various runs, a strategy is proposed to generate a new combined feature set from all initializations. Applying the proposed strategy to four datasets of different sizes and two classification algorithms shows that the resulting feature sets are significantly better compared to the original mRMR algorithm for the given classification task. The proposed method is well-suited for cases where it is not feasible to use wrapper-methods to increase classification accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7560-0; POD:978-1-4799-7561-7","10.1109/SSCI.2015.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7376629","","Error analysis;Iterative methods;Machine learning algorithms;Merging;Mutual information;Redundancy;Search problems","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","classification performance;classification task;distinct feature sets;feature selection;filter-method;machine learning algorithms;minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance algorithm;multiple mRMR initializations;pairwise mutual information;wrapper-methods","","","","25","","","7-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results show that neighborhood analysis should be combined with stacked auto encoders to achieve some notable promotions of their performances.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8697-2; POD:978-1-4799-8698-9","10.1109/SMC.2015.513","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7379645","feature learning;locally linear embedding;manifold regularization;stacked autoencoder","Artificial neural networks;Machine learning;Manifolds;Optimization;Sparse matrices;Training;Yttrium","learning (artificial intelligence)","MNIST database;Yale Faces database;deep learning;deep multilayer substructures;feature learning;hierarchical framework;intrinsic information;locally linear embedding;manifold regularized stacked autoencoder","","","","14","","","9-12 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To automatically find a good similarity measure from datasets, metric learning and similarity learning are proposed and studied extensively. Metric learning will learn a Mahalanobis distance based on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix, to measure the distances between objectives, while similarity learning aims to directly learn a similarity function without PSD constraint so that it is more attractive. Most of the existing similarity learning algorithms are online similarity learning method, since online learning is more scalable than offline learning. However, most existing online similarity learning algorithms learn a full matrix with d<sup>2</sup> parameters, where d is the dimension of the instances. This is clearly inefficient for high dimensional tasks due to its high memory and computational complexity. To solve this issue, we introduce several Sparse Online Relative Similarity (SORS) learning algorithms, which learn a sparse model during the learning process, so that the memory and computational cost can be significantly reduced. We theoretically analyze the proposed algorithms, and evaluate them on some real-world high dimensional datasets. Encouraging empirical results demonstrate the advantages of our approach in terms of efficiency and efficacy.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-1-4673-9504-5; POD:978-1-4673-9505-2","10.1109/ICDM.2015.100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373357","Data stream mining;High-dimensional similarity learning;Sparse Online learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Data mining;Image retrieval;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement;Sparse matrices","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence)","SORS learning algorithms;data mining;learning process;machine learning tasks;sparse model;sparse online relative similarity learning","","","","44","","","14-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An ensemble method for unbalanced sentiment classification","D. Zhang; J. Ma; J. Yi; X. Niu; X.

Most study on sentiment classification has been done on the balanced data, so these methods perform well on balanced data, while are unable to maintain the same performance on unbalanced data set. This paper proposed a method for unbalanced sentiment classification that combines unbalanced classification method and ensemble learning technique. Both algorithm and data set are considered to enhance the classification performance of imbalance sentiment data set. Under the framework of ensemble learning, this hybrid method integrates three different methods: under-sampling, bootstrap re-sampling and random feature selection to process the data set. Experiments on the unbalanced data set prove that this ensemble method can improve the classification performance of unbalanced sentiment data set.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7678-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-7679-2; POD:978-1-4673-7680-8","10.1109/ICNC.2015.7378029","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378029","Ensemble learning;Sentiment classification;Unbalanced data classification","Bagging;Classification algorithms;Computer science;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Training data","Internet;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sentiment analysis","binary sentiment classification;bootstrap resampling method;ensemble learning technique;imbalance sentiment data set;random feature selection;unbalanced sentiment classification;undersampling method","","","","40","","","15-17 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a decomposed version of the KKN (DKNN) method, which classifies an unseen object based on the distances to the centroids of the KNNs. DKNN has a training process to learn the local-optimafree distance metric by solving a convex optimization problem. The optimization problem not only learns a metric that minimizes classification errors and maximizes the margin between intraclass and interclass distances. In addition, it also selects important features and removes irrelevant features when L1 regularization is incorporated in the optimization model. The feature selection component is extremely useful for high-dimensional classification problems. Tested on public datasets, the proposed DKNN is competitive and often outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2429637","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110385","Classification;convex optimization;feature selection;k-nearest neighbors (KNNs);metric learning;regularization","Convex functions;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement;Modeling;Optimization;Support vector machines;Training","convex programming;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence)","KNN method;convex optimization problem;decomposed nearest neighbor;feature selection;k-nearest neighbor method;local-optima-free distance metric","","1","","32","","20150519","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We discussed the novel channel-wise convolutional neural network (CCNN) and CCNN-R which is a CCNN variation that uses Restricted Boltzmann Machine in order to replace the convolutional filter. We also consider bagging classifiers based on DL hidden units as an alternative to the conventional DL solutions. To test the performance of the proposed methods, a large EEG dataset from 3 studies of driver's fatigue that includes 70 sessions from 37 subjects is assembled. All proposed methods are tested on both raw EEG and Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-transformed data for cross-session predictions. The results show that CCNN and CCNN-R outperform deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as well as other non-DL algorithms and DL with raw EEG inputs achieves better performance than ICA features.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1963-5; POD:978-1-4799-1964-2","10.1109/CAMSAP.2015.7383844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383844","","Backpropagation;Bagging;Convolution;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Prediction algorithms","Boltzmann machines;driver information systems;electroencephalography;independent component analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing","CCNN-R;EEG signal;ICA;bagging classifier;channel-wise convolutional neural network;cognitive state;deep learning;driver alert state;driver drowsy state;independent component analysis;restricted Boltzmann machine","","1","","18","","","13-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
