The first stage of the proposed method is an automatic separation of unambiguous affective and judgmental adjectives from those that express appreciation or different attitudes depending on context. In our experiments with machine learning algorithms we employed three feature sets based on Pointwise Mutual Information, word-pattern co-occurrence, and minimal path length. The next stage of the proposed method is to estimate the potentials of miscellaneous adjectives to convey affect, judgment, and appreciation. Based on the sentences automatically collected for each adjective, the algorithm analyses the context of phrases that contain sentiment words by considering morphological tags, high-level concepts, and named entities, and then makes decisions about contextual attitude labels. Finally, the appraisal potentials of a word are calculated based on the number of sentences related to each type of attitude. Our two-stage method was evaluated on two data sets, and promising results were obtained.

In Machine Learning, for instance, a decision is made through the use of a learning algorithm and the characterization process is represented by the corresponding datasets. In this context, classification algorithms can be applied, individually or through the use of ensemble systems (combination of classification methods), in the decision-making process. The concept of ensemble systems has emerged in the last decades as a strategy for combining independent classifiers (components), aiming to provide a decision that is potentially more effective than any single component. However, the design of the ensemble structure is not an easy task and it can have an important impact in the performance of these systems. In this paper, we investigate the use of meta-learning on the selection of the best configuration parameters (learning strategy, size and individual classifiers) for homogeneous structures of ensemble systems. The main aim of this analysis is to assess the effect of using meta-learning in the design of efficient and robust ensemble systems.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4673-6129-3; POD:978-1-4673-6127-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707016","","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Bagging;Entropy;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Support vector machines","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","classifier committee;configuration parameters;decision making process;ensemble systems;homogeneous structures;meta-learning;multiclassifier systems","","2","","27","","","4-9 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.","2324-898X;2324898X","Electronic:978-0-7695-5022-0; POD:978-1-4799-1444-9","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847","Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection","Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation","","2","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When different sensors acquire data over the same region of the Earth, a direct comparison between pixels acquired from one sensor to pixels acquired from a another sensor becomes difficult. For example, there could be different number of bands, or the sensors could measure drastically different spaces (hyperspectral and LIDAR). A solution to this problem is Feature Space Rotation, which realizes the sensor data independently in separate feature spaces via a machine learning algorithm and then a rotation is learned to bring the separate feature spaces into a common feature space. This rotation, in it original form, requires some amount of overlap between the data sets. We propose a study to determine the effect of decreasing the amount of overlap between the two sensors has on the classification accuracy. For this study, we shall rely on hyperspectral data that has been simulated to come from two disjoint sensors.","1550-5219;15505219","Electronic:978-1-4799-2540-7; POD:978-1-4799-2541-4","10.1109/AIPR.2013.6749316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6749316","","Data integration;Extraterrestrial measurements;Hyperspectral imaging;Laplace equations;Machine learning algorithms;Sensors","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;image fusion;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);optical radar","LIDAR;classification accuracy;common feature space;disjoint sensors;diverse-heterogeneous data set fusion;feature space rotation;hyperspectral data;machine learning algorithm;overlapping segments;sensor data;separate feature spaces","","2","","30","","","23-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many concept drift applications require fast response, which means an algorithm must always be (re)trained with the latest available data. But the process of data labeling is usually expensive and/or time consuming when compared to acquisition of unlabeled data, thus usually only a small fraction of the incoming data may be effectively labeled. Semi-supervised learning methods may help in this scenario, as they use both labeled and unlabeled data in the training process. However, most of them are based on assumptions that the data is static. Therefore, semi-supervised learning with concept drifts is still an open challenging task in machine learning. Recently, a particle competition and cooperation approach has been developed to realize graph-based semi-supervised learning from static data. We have extend that approach to handle data streams and concept drift. The result is a passive algorithm which uses a single classifier approach, naturally adapted to concept changes without any explicit drift detection mechanism. It has built-in mechanisms that provide a natural way of learning from new data, gradually ""forgetting"" older knowledge as older data items are no longer useful for the classification of newer data items.

Stochastic gradient descent is the currently preferred solution methodology but the number of iterations required to approximate optimal arguments can be prohibitive in high dimensional problems. BFGS modifies gradient descent by introducing a Hessian approximation matrix computed from finite gradient differences. This paper utilizes stochastic gradient differences and introduces a regularization to ensure that the Hessian approximation matrix remains well conditioned. The resulting regularized stochastic BFGS method is shown to converge to optimal arguments almost surely over realizations of the stochastic gradient sequence. Numerical experiments showcase reductions in convergence time relative to stochastic gradient descent algorithms and non-regularized stochastic versions of BFGS.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0248-4; POD:978-1-4799-0246-0","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6737088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737088","","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Convergence;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Linear programming;Machine learning algorithms;Vectors","Newton method;approximation theory;convergence of numerical methods;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;optimisation","BFGS quasi-Newton method;Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm;Hessian approximation matrix;convergence time;finite gradient differences;large scale machine learning;optimal arguments;optimization problems;regularization;regularized stochastic BFGS algorithm;stochastic gradient descent;stochastic gradient differences;stochastic objectives","","4","","10","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A concern arises that the sensory information collected by the providers, although coarse-grained, can be subject to analysis that reveals private information about the users of the building. Oftentimes, multiple services are provided by the same company, in which case the potential for leakage of private information increases. Our research seeks to investigate the extent to which easily available sensory information may be used by external service providers to make occupancy-related inferences. Particularly, we focus on inferences from two different sources: motion sensors, which are installed and monitored by security companies, and smart electric meters, which are deployed by electric companies for billing and demand-response management. We explore the motion sensor scenario in a three-person single-family home and the electric meter scenario in a twelve-person university lab. Our exploration with various inference methods shows that sensory information available to service providers can enable them to make undesired occupancy related inferences, such as levels of occupancy or even the identities of current occupants, significantly better than naive prediction strategies that do not make use of sensor information.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3445-4; POD:978-1-4799-3446-1; USB:978-1-4799-3444-7","10.1109/PerCom.2014.6813945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6813945","","Companies;Data models;Educational institutions;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring;Security","building management systems;buildings (structures);control engineering computing;security of data;sensors;smart meters","billing;commercial buildings;demand-response management;electric company;external service provider;motion sensor;occupancy-related inference;opportunistically available sensor data;prediction strategy;private information;residential buildings;security company;sensory information;service providers;smart electric meter;utility infrastructure","","2","","18","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nonnegative spectral clustering is developed to learn more accurate cluster labels of the input samples, which guide feature selection simultaneously. Meanwhile, the cluster labels are also predicted by exploiting the hidden structure shared by different features, which can uncover feature correlations to make the results more reliable. Row-wise sparse models are leveraged to make the proposed model suitable for feature selection. To optimize the proposed formulation, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm.

Current reverse-engineering techniques focus either on control-specific behaviour (e.g. in the form of Finite State Machines), or data-specific behaviour (e.g. as pre/post-conditions or invariants). However, typical software behaviour is usually a product of the two; models must combine both aspects to fully represent the software's operation. Extended Finite State Machines (EFSMs) provide such a model. Although attempts have been made to infer EFSMs, these have been problematic. The models inferred by these techniques can be non deterministic, the inference algorithms can be inflexible, and only applicable to traces with specific characteristics. This paper presents a novel EFSM inference technique that addresses the problems of inflexibility and non determinism. It also adapts an experimental technique from the field of Machine Learning to evaluate EFSM inference techniques, and applies it to two open-source software projects.","1095-1350;10951350","Electronic:978-1-4799-2931-3; POD:978-1-4799-2932-0","10.1109/WCRE.2013.6671305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671305","","Automata;Data models;Inference algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Merging;Software;Software algorithms","finite state machines;learning (artificial intelligence);program verification;project management;public domain software;reverse engineering;software maintenance","EFSM inference technique;control-specific behaviour;data-specific behaviour;extended finite state machine models;machine learning;open-source software projects;reverse-engineering techniques;software behaviour;software executions;software maintenance;software validation;software verification tasks","","6","","30","","","14-17 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An algorithm can be selected using only image features, however such selected algorithms will often generate errors due to occlusion, shadows and other environmental conditions. To avoid such errors, it is necessary to understand processing errors on a symbolic level. Using symbolic information to determine the best algorithm is however difficult task because the possible combinations of elements and environmental conditions are almost infinite. Consequently it is impossible to predict best algorithm for all possible combinations of objects, environment conditions and context variations. In this paper we investigate selection of algorithms using symbolic image description and the determination of algorithms' error from high level image description. The proposed method transforms and minimize the high level information contained in the symbolic image description in such manner that will preserve the algorithm selection quality. The transformation takes a high level information label and transforms it into a set of generic features while the minimization uses hierarchy to reduce the specific nature of the information. Both methods of information reduction are used in a Bayesian Network because a BN is well known for using the generalization and hierarchy. As is shown in this paper, such representation efficiently reduces the fine grain high-level symbolic description to a coarser-grain hierarchy that preserves the selection quality but reduces the number of nodes.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2364-9; POD:978-1-4799-4400-2","10.1109/ICAwST.2013.6765411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6765411","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bayes methods;Context;Feature extraction;Image recognition;Machine learning algorithms;Object recognition","belief networks;image processing","BN;Bayesian network;algorithm selection;algorithm selection quality;context variations;environmental conditions;high level image description;high level information;high level information label;image features;image understanding;node reduction;real-world hierarchy;symbolic image description;symbolic information","","1","","16","","","2-4 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of just checking whether there is one phrase adjacent to a given phrase, our method firstly uses a compact structure named reordering graph to represent all phrase segmentations of a parallel sentence, then the effect of the adjacent phrase number can be quantified in a forward-backward fashion, and finally incorporated into the estimation of reordering models.

We used feature selection techniques, Consistency Subset Evaluation, at the beginning to remove insignificant attributes of data. The remaining attributes were fed into over-sampling phase to adjust instances in the minority class. After preprocessed the dataset, we classified data using three classification algorithms, decision tree, BayesNet, and OneR.

Deep-Packet Inspection (DPI) has been a very important research topic within the traffic classification field and its concept consists of the analysis of the contents of the captured packets in order to accurately and timely discriminate the traffic generated by different Internet protocols. DPI was devised as a means to address several issues associated with port-based and statistical-based classification approaches in order to achieve an accurate and timely traffic classification. Many research works proposed different DPI schemes while many open-source modules have also become available for deployment. Surveys become then valuable tools for performing an overall analysis, study and comparison between the several proposed methods. In this paper we present a survey in which a complete and thorough analysis of the most important open-source DPI modules is performed. Such analysis comprises an evaluation of the classification accuracy, through a common set of traffic traces with ground truth, and of the computational requirements.

The emergence of the white space bands for data usage enables increased flexibility for vehicular networks with distinct propagation characteristics across frequency bands from 450 MHz to 6 GHz. Since wireless propagation largely depends on the environment in operation, a historical understanding of the frequency bands' performance in a given environment could expedite band selection as vehicles transition across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we leverage knowledge of in-situ operation across frequency bands with real-time measurements of the activity level to select the the band with the highest throughput. To do so, we perform a number of experiments in typical vehicular topologies. With two models based on machine learning algorithms and an in-situ training set, we predict the throughput based on: (i.) prior performance for similar context information (e.g., SNR, GPS, relative speed, and link distance), and (ii.) real-time activity level and relative channel quality per band.

Wainwright","Microsoft Res., New York, NY, USA","2014 48th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)","20140512","2014","","","1","2","Summary form only given. Stochastic optimization algorithms have many desirable features for large-scale machine learning, and accordingly have been the focus of renewed and intensive study in the last several years (e.g., see the papers [2], [5], [14] and references therein). The empirical efficiency of these methods is backed with strong theoretical guarantees, providing sharp bounds on their convergence rates. These convergence rates are known to depend on the structure of the underlying objective function, with faster rates being possible for objective functions that are smooth and/or (strongly) convex, or optima that have desirable features such as sparsity. More precisely, for an objective function that is strongly convex, stochastic gradient descent enjoys a convergence rate ranging from O(1/T ), when features vectors are extremely sparse, to O(d/T ) when feature vectors are dense [10], [6]. A complementary type of condition is that of sparsity, either exact or approximate, in the optimal solution. Sparse models have proven useful in many application areas (see the overview papers [4], [9], [3] and references therein for further background), and many optimization-based statistical procedures seek to exploit such sparsity via ℓ1-regularization. A significant feature of optimization algorithms for sparse problems is their mild logarithmic scaling with the problem dimension [11], [12], [5], [14]. More precisely, itis known [11], [12] that when the optimal solution θ has at most s non-zero entries, appropriate versions of the stochastic mirror descent algorithm ',/ converge at a rate O(s (log d)/T ). Srebro et al. [13] exploit the smoothness of many common loss functions; in application to sparse linear regression, their analysis yields improved rates ',/ of the form O(η (s log d)/T), where η is the noise variance. While the Vlog d scaling of the dimension makes these methods attractive in high dimensions, the scaling with respe- t to the number V of iterations is relatively slow-namely, O(1/ T ) versus O(1/T) for strongly convex problems.The algorithm proposed in this paper aims to use both strong convexity and sparsity. We show that the algorithm has convergence rate O((s log d)/T) for a strongly convex problem with an s-sparse optimum in d dimensions. Moreover, this rate is unimprovable up to constant factors, meaning that no algorithm can converge at a substantially faster rate. The method builds off recent work on multi-step methods for strongly convex problems [7], [8], but involves some new ingredients that are essential to obtain optimal rates for statistical problems with sparse optima. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical predictions regarding the convergence rate of the algorithm, and demonstrate its performance in comparison to other methods: regularized dual averaging [14] and stochastic gradient descent algorithms. We refer the reader to the full report [1] for more details.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3001-2; POD:978-1-4799-3003-6","10.1109/CISS.2014.6814157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814157","","Convergence;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Stochastic processes","gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis;stochastic programming","convergence rates;feature vectors;large-scale machine learning;objective function;optimal algorithm;optimization-based statistical procedures;regularized dual averaging algorithm;sparse statistical recovery;sparsity feature;stochastic gradient descent;stochastic optimization;strongly convex problem","","0","","14","","","19-21 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

State-of-the-art PAclassification systems use threshold-based techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Each PA may exhibitinter-subject and intra-subject variability which is a major drawback for threshold and machine learning based techniques. Due to lack of empirical data in order to train classifier for ML clustering algorithms, there is a need to develop a mechanism which requires less training data for PA clustering. This paper describes a novel personalized PArecognition model framework based on a semi-supervised clustering approach to avoid fixed threshold techniques and traditional clustering methods by using a single accelerometer. The proposed methodology requires limited amount of data to compute (initial) centroids for PA clusters and achieved an accuracy of about 93% on average, moreover it has the potential capability of recognizing subjects' behavioral shifts and exceptional events, falls, etc.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2577-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-2578-0; POD:978-1-4799-2579-7","10.1109/EMS.2013.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779819","Ambient assisted living;Independent living;Physical activity recognition;Physical activity transition model;Semi-supervised clustering","Accelerometers;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Sensors","assisted living;image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;planning (artificial intelligence)","MEMS technology;ML clustering algorithms;PA clustering;activity recognition systems;assisted living;exceptional events recognition;exhibit inter-subject variability;exhibit intra-subject variability;fall recognition;healthcare;machine learning algorithms;personalized PA recognition model framework;physical activities;semisupervised clustering;single accelerometer;subject behavioral shifts recognition;subject-dependent physical activity recognition model framework;threshold-based techniques;wearable accelerometers","","0","","28","","","20-22 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of active learning is to maximize the performance of a learning model using as few labeled training data as possible, thereby minimizing the cost of data annotation. So far, there is still very limited work on active learning for regression. In this paper, we propose a new active learning framework for regression called Expected Model Change Maximization (EMCM), which aims to choose the examples that lead to the largest change to the current model. The model change is measured as the difference between the current model parameters and the updated parameters after training with the enlarged training set. Inspired by the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) update rule, the change is estimated as the gradient of the loss with respect to a candidate example for active learning. Under this framework, we derive novel active learning algorithms for both linear regression and nonlinear regression to select the most informative examples. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark data sets from UCI machine learning repository have demonstrated that the proposed algorithms are highly effective in choosing the most informative examples and robust to various types of data distributions.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-0-7695-5108-1; POD:978-1-4799-1328-2","10.1109/ICDM.2013.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6729489","Active learning;Expected Model Change Maximization;Linear Regression;Nonlinear regression","Current measurement;Data models;Linear regression;Machine learning algorithms;Regression tree analysis;Training;Training data","expectation-maximisation algorithm;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;stochastic processes","EMCM;SGD update rule;UCI machine learning repository;active learning algorithms;active learning framework;data annotation;data distributions;enlarged training set;expected model change maximization;labeled training data;nonlinear regression;stochastic gradient descent update rule;supervised learning;unlabeled data","","6","","18","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A main issue in these algorithms is choosing the proper distance metric. In recent years, learning an appropriate distance metric has become a very active research field. In the kernelised version of distance metric learning algorithms, the data points are implicitly mapped into a higher dimensional feature space and the learning process is performed in the resulted feature space. The performance of the kernel-based methods heavily depends on the chosen kernel function. So, selecting an appropriate kernel function and/or tuning its parameter(s) impose significant challenges in such methods. The Multiple Kernel Learning theory (MKL) addresses this problem by learning a linear combination of a number of predefined kernels. In this paper, we formulate the MKL problem in a semi-supervised metric learning framework. In the proposed approach, pairwise similarity constraints are used to adjust the weights of the combined kernels and simultaneously learn the appropriate distance metric. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that the proposed method outperforms some recently introduced semi-supervised metric learning approaches.","2166-6776;21666776","Electronic:978-1-4673-6184-2; POD:978-1-4673-6183-5","10.1109/IranianMVIP.2013.6780028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6780028","Distance Metric Learning;Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL);Pairwise similarity constraints;Semi-supervised clustering","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement;Optimization","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;pattern recognition","MKL;distance metric learning algorithms;feature space;kernel function;kernelised version;linear combination;machine learning algorithms;multiple Kernel learning theory;novel multiple kernel learning approach;pattern recognition algorithms;semisupervised clustering","","1","","16","","","10-12 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Under-representation of one or more of the target classes (minority class(es)) as compared to others (majority class(es)) can restrict the application of conventional classifiers directly on the data. In addition, emerging challenges such as overlapping classes, make class imbalance even harder to solve. Class overlap is caused due to ambiguous regions in the data where the prior probability of two or more classes are approximately equal. We are motivated to address the challenge of class overlap in the presence of imbalanced classes by a problem in pervasive computing. Specifically, we are designing smart environments that perform health monitoring and assistance. Our solution, ClusBUS, is a clustering-based under sampling technique that identifies data regions where minority class samples are embedded deep inside majority class. By removing majority class samples from these regions, ClusBUS preprocesses the data in order to give more importance to the minority class during classification. Experiments show that ClusBUS achieves improved performance over an existing method for handling class imbalance.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-1-4799-3142-2; POD:978-1-4799-3144-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753930","Class imbalance;automated prompting;overlapping classes;sampling","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring;Noise;Smart homes;Support vector machines","home automation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;ubiquitous computing","ClusBUS;class imbalance;class overlap;classification challenge;clustering-based undersampling technique;health monitoring;machine learning;pervasive computing;prompt situation detection;smart environments;smart homes","","0","","35","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The theory developed is demonstrated on a nonlinear-polarization-rotation-based laser using waveplate and polarizer angles to achieve optimal passive mode-locking despite large disturbances to the system. The physically realizable objective function introduced divides the energy output by the fourth moment of the pulse spectrum, thus balancing the total energy with the time duration of the mode-locked solution. Moreover, its peaks are high-energy mode-locked states that have a safety margin near parameter regimes where mode-locking breaks down or the multipulsing instability occurs.

In this paper, we study the problem of using high dimensional medication data to predict the probability of 30-Day heart failure readmission. We propose a feature reduction method for high dimensional dataset using a combination of two drug ontologies. By creating a tree structure of the combination, the method uses a greedy strategy to obtain a subset of features, which may have higher correlation with the class label but lower correlation with each other. Experimental results show that our methods improve the performance of heart failure readmission prediction (using only drug data) comparing to existing feature reduction methods without drug domain ontologies.","","Electronic:978-1-936968-92-3; POD:978-1-4799-2754-8; USB:978-1-936968-91-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680015","Domain Ontology;Feature Reduction;Feature Selection;Heart Failure Readmission Prediction;High Dimensional Data","Drugs;Heart;Hospitals;Information filters;Machine learning algorithms;Ontologies","diseases;drugs;feature extraction;greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;probability;tree data structures","30-day heart failure readmission prediction;class label;clustering concepts;domain ontology-based feature reduction;drug domain ontologies;drug ontologies;feature reduction method;features subset;greedy strategy;high dimensional dataset;high dimensional drug data;high dimensional feature space;high dimensional medication data;learning algorithms;machine learning;probability;tree structure","","0","","19","","","20-23 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Idea of this study is to examine the competence and effectiveness of machine learning regression techniques which are experimented here to build precise and constructive evaluation model that can assess the reusability of Object Oriented based software components based on the values of five metrics of metrics suite presented by “Shyam R.

By setting different values of parameters of these algorithms, it is also concluded that which specific algorithm or class of algorithms is appropriate for reusability evaluation and with which parameter's values.

In this work, we use the machine learning-based classification method to identify the classes of the flows. According to previous work, we choose transfer learning algorithm to classify the traffic, and improve classified results. Finally we compare and evaluate the classification results in terms of the two metrics such as true positive ratio and time expense. Our experiments show that the machine learning algorithm is an efficient algorithm for traffic identification and is able to build a quick identification system.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1282-7","10.1109/GrC.2013.6740374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6740374","P2P;traffic flow identification;transfer learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Training data","computer network management;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","Internet;P2P traffic identification;flow class identification;machine learning algorithm;machine learning-based classification method;network management;network monitoring;network operators;peer-to-peer networks;time expense metrics;transfer learning algorithm;true positive ratio metrics","","0","","18","","","13-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the promising approaches is the application of machine learning techniques to classify alerts based on a set of artifact characteristics. In this work, we evaluate this approach in the context of an industrial case study to classify the alerts generated for a digital TV software.

Despite its importance, most studies of feature selection are restricted to batch learning. Unlike traditional batch learning methods, online learning represents a promising family of efficient and scalable machine learning algorithms for large-scale applications. Most existing studies of online learning require accessing all the attributes/features of training instances. Such a classical setting is not always appropriate for real-world applications when data instances are of high dimensionality or it is expensive to acquire the full set of attributes/features. To address this limitation, we investigate the problem of online feature selection (OFS) in which an online learner is only allowed to maintain a classifier involved only a small and fixed number of features. The key challenge of online feature selection is how to make accurate prediction for an instance using a small number of active features. This is in contrast to the classical setup of online learning where all the features can be used for prediction. We attempt to tackle this challenge by studying sparsity regularization and truncation techniques. Specifically, this article addresses two different tasks of online feature selection: 1) learning with full input, where an learner is allowed to access all the features to decide the subset of active features, and 2) learning with partial input, where only a limited number of features is allowed to be accessed for each instance by the learner. We present novel algorithms to solve each of the two problems and give their performance analysis. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for online feature selection on several public data sets, and demonstrate their applications to real-world problems including image classification in computer vision and microarray gene expression analysis in bioinformatics. The encouraging results of our experiments validate the efficacy and efficiency of th- proposed techniques.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522405","Feature selection;big data analytics;classification;large-scale data mining;online learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Training","Big Data;data mining;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence)","Big Data analytics;OFS;batch learning;bioinformatics;computer vision;data mining;image classification;large-scale applications;machine learning algorithms;microarray gene expression analysis;online feature selection;online learner;online learning;performance analysis;performance evaluation;sparsity regularization technique;sparsity truncation technique","","25","","54","","20130531","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Identification of (pre-) miRNAs helps in understanding regulatory processes. Machine learning methods have been designed for pre-miRNA identification. However, most of them cannot provide reliable predictive performances on independent testing data sets. We assumed this is because the training sets, especially the negative training sets, are not sufficiently representative. To generate a representative negative set, we proposed a novel negative sample selection technique, and successfully collected negative samples with improved quality. Two recent classifiers rebuilt with the proposed negative set achieved an improvement of ~6 percent in their predictive performance, which confirmed this assumption. Based on the proposed negative set, we constructed a training set, and developed an online system called miRNApre specifically for human pre-miRNA identification. We showed that miRNApre achieved accuracies on updated human and non-human data sets that were 34.3 and 7.6 percent higher than those achieved by current methods. The results suggest that miRNApre is an effective tool for pre-miRNA identification. Additionally, by integrating miRNApre, we developed a miRNA mining tool, mirnaDetect, which can be applied to find potential miRNAs in genome-scale data. MirnaDetect achieved a comparable mining performance on human chromosome 19 data as other existing methods.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2013.146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661313","MicroRNA;high-quality negative set;microRNA identification;multi-level negative sample selection","Biological processes;Data mining;Genetics;Machine learning;RNA","RNA;biochemistry;bioinformatics;classification;data mining;genomics;information services;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics","MirnaDetect mining performance;biological process regulator;classifier predictive performance;genome-scale data;high-quality negative training set incorporation;human chromosome 19 data;human microRNA identification;human pre-miRNA identification;independent testing data sets;machine learning methods;miRNA mining tool;miRNApre accuracy;mirnaDetect;negative sample collection;negative sample quality;negative sample selection technique;nonhuman data sets;online system;representative negative set generation;training set construction","0","47","","33","","20131111","Jan.-Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Simultaneous consideration of these objectives makes online distributed scheduling a very challenging problem. Prior distributed scheduling approaches are limited to shared memory or primarily use work-stealing across distributed memory nodes for load-balancing or depend on the programmer specified affinity. However, the performance of affinity driven scheduling and work stealing based algorithms degrades when the input is irregular(UTS) and/or sparse. In this paper we present a novel adaptive distributed scheduling algorithm (ALDS) for multi-place parallel computations, that uses a unique combination of remote (inter-place) spawns and remote work steals to reduce the overheads in the scheduler, which helps to dynamically maintain load balance across the compute nodes of the system, while ensuring affinity maximally. Using parallel machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Regression running concurrently with program execution on the target architecture, ALDS can automatically and adaptively tune the parameters for scalable performance. Our design was implemented using GASNet API and POSIX threads.

One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection. A Genetic algorithm was applied with deterministic crowding niching technique, to generate a set of detectors from a single run.

However, its distributed nature leads to operational brittleness and difficulty in identifying the root causes of performance and availability issues, especially when the involved systems span multiple administrative domains. The first step to address this fragmentation is coordinated measurement: we propose to complement the current Internet's data and control planes with a measurement plane, or mPlane for short. mPlane's distributed measurement infrastructure collects and analyzes traffic measurements at a wide variety of scales to monitor the network status. Its architecture is centered on a flexible control interface, allowing the incorporation of existing measurement tools through lightweight mPlane proxy components, and offering dynamic support for new capabilities. A focus on automated, iterative measurement makes the platform well-suited to troubleshooting support. This is supported by a reasoning system, which applies machine learning algorithms to learn from success and failure in drilling down to the root cause of a problem. This article describes the mPlane architecture and shows its applicability to several distributed measurement problems involving content delivery networks and Internet service roviders.

While this has many benefits, it also makes some software engineering tasks,such as software testing, much harder. This is because, in theory,unique errors could be hiding in any configuration, and, therefore,every configuration may need to undergo expensive testing. As this is generally infeasible, developers need cost-effective technique for selecting which specific configurations they will test. One popular selection approach is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), where the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array (a set of configurations) in which all t-way combinations of configuration option settings appear at least once. In prior work, we demonstrated several limitations of the CIT approach. In particular, we found that a given system's effective configuration space - the minimal set of configurations needed to achieve a specific goal - could comprise only a tiny subset of the system's full configuration space. We also found that effective configuration space may not be well approximated by t-way covering arrays. Based on these insights we have developed an algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree). iTree is an iterative learning algorithm that efficiently searches for a small set of configurations that closely approximates a system's effective configuration space. On each iteration iTree tests the system on a small sample of carefully chosen configurations, monitors the system's behaviors, and then applies machine learning techniques to discover which combinations of option settings are potentially responsible for any newly observed behaviors. This information is used in the next iteration to pick a new sample of configurations that are likely to reveal further new behaviors. In prior work, we presented an initial version of iTree and performed an initial evaluation with promising results. This paper presents an improved iTree algorithm in greater detail. The - ey improvements are based on our use of composite proto-interactions - a construct that improves iTree's ability to correctly learn key configuration option combinations, which in turn significantly improves iTree's running time, without sacrificing effectiveness. Finally, the paper presents a detailed evaluation of the improved iTree algorithm by comparing the coverage it achieves versus that of covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets, including a significantly expanded scalability evaluation with the ~ 1M-LOC MySQL. Our results strongly suggest that the improved iTree algorithm is highly scalable and can identify a high-coverage test set of configurations more effectively than existing methods.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2013.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671585","Empirical software engineering;software configurations;software testing and analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Machine learning algorithms;Software algorithms;Software engineering;Software systems;Testing","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);program testing;software engineering","CIT;combinatorial interaction testing;cost-effective technique;efficiently discovering high-coverage configurations;iTree;iTree algorithm;interaction tree discovery;interaction trees;iterative learning algorithm;machine learning techniques;software engineering;software systems;software testing","","1","","39","","20131120","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we focus our research on effective term weighting and propose a novel Term weighting approach i.e. Positive Impact Factor (PIF). PIF is a supervised variation of traditional term weighting models.

Due to its irregularity in spatial shape and lack of spectral information, it is a challenging issue to utilize machine learning algorithms to classify this region accurately. Recently, two studies [1,2] shed some light on this topic by considering its spectral information jointly with spatial one as features and evaluated the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms for classification and measurement of CSA. Their experimental studies indicated that it is feasible to classify the CSA region based on its spectral and spatial information. However, the accuracy heavily relies on decent training samples picked from a region which could only be provided from manual marks of experienced doctors. This manuscript aimed to propose an automatic method to remove requirement of human intervention to determine the training region, and further make the supervised classification methods proposed in [1,2] become unsupervised classification methods.

The first one is the Simple Matching Dissimilarity Measure (SMDM), which is one of the simplest and the most used metric for categorical attribute. The other two are context-based approaches (DIstance Learning in Categorical Attributes - DILCA and Domain Value Dissimilarity-DVD), and the last one is an extension of the SMDM, which is proposed in this paper.

Pairwise constraints and constraint projections are two popular techniques in semi-supervised clustering. However, both of them only consider the given constraints and do not consider the neighbors around the data points constrained by the constraints. This paper presents a new technique by utilizing the constrained pairwise data points and their neighbors, denoted as constraint neighborhood projections that requires fewer labeled data points (constraints) and can naturally deal with constraint conflicts. It includes two steps: 1) the constraint neighbors are chosen according to the pairwise constraints and a given radius so that the pairwise constraint relationships can be extended to their neighbors, and 2) the original data points are projected into a new low-dimensional space learned from the pairwise constraints and their neighbors. A CNP-Kmeans algorithm is developed based on the constraint neighborhood projections. Extensive experiments on University of California Irvine (UCI) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our study also shows that constraint neighborhood projections (CNP) has some favorable features compared with the previous techniques.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2263383","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705638","Constraint neighborhood projections (CNP);pairwise constraints;semi-supervised clustering","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Educational institutions;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Inference algorithms;Machine learning algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","CNP-Kmeans algorithm;UCI datasets;University of California Irvine;constrained pairwise data points;constraint neighborhood projections;labeled data points;pairwise constraints;semisupervised clustering;semisupervised clustering algorithm","","3","","28","","20140109","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, most of the proposed PUFs have been shown to be vulnerable to modeling attacks, especially against Machine Learning algorithms. A subset of challenge-response pairs can leak the required information to break a PUF due to the presence of a linear separating boundary between the PUF responses. In this paper, we propose a strong and secure PUF based on non-linear current mirrors. The fundamental idea is to propagate a current through two identical chains of non-linear current mirrors. The current through a single stage is shifted by some amount based on the strength of the input current. As the current shift is not a fixed value anymore, strong non-linearity is introduced into the challenge-response relationship. The proposed PUF shows excellent properties upon statistical circuit simulation. The average inter-distance and intra-distance of the proposed PUF are 49.9% and 0.8% respectively. One of the most striking features of the proposed PUF is the low information leakage measured in terms of its modeling attack resistance. By employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) based attacks, we observed that the proposed PUF is almost 10-30x stronger than the delay-based PUFs. Moreover, the current mode nature of the PUF circuit enables low power operation. The proposed PUF consumes about 15% lower energy than an arbiter PUF to produce a single response bit.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4114-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-4112-4; POD:978-1-4799-4111-7","10.1109/HST.2014.6855565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6855565","Hardware security;Modeling attacks;PUFs","Delays;Integrated circuit modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Mirrors;Reliability;Security;Support vector machines","circuit simulation;current mirrors;digital signatures;electronic engineering computing;integrated circuit manufacture;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis;support vector machines","SVM based attacks;information leakage measure;lightweight hardware security primitives;linear separating boundary;machine learning algorithm;modeling attack resistance;nonlinear current mirror;physically unclonable function;secure PUF;statistical circuit simulation;support vector machine;unique signature generation","","9","","13","","","6-7 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even the suitability of the free parameters of the NbSSL algorithms varies according to the available labeled data. Indeed, we propose a method for selecting representative data instances for labeling for NbSSL. In our sense the represent ability of a node is related to how inhomogeneous is its profile concerning the whole network. The proposed method uses Complex Networks centrality measures to identify which nodes present inhomogeneous profile. We perform this study by applying three NbSSL algorithms on Girvan-Newman and Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi modular networks. In the former, the nodes with high clustering coefficient are good representatives of the data and the nodes with high betweenness are the good representatives ones in the later. A high clustering coefficient means that the node lies in a much connected motif (clique) whereas a high betweenness means that the node lies interconnecting the modular structures.

McFIS has two components: a cognitive component and a metacognitive component. A neuro-fuzzy inference system forms the cognitive component of the McFIS, and a self-regulatory learning mechanism forms its metacognitive component. The learning ability of the cognitive component is monitored and controlled by the self-regulatory learning mechanism. For each sample in the training dataset, the metacognitive component uses its self-adaptive thresholds to choose one of the following learning strategies based on the criteria that depends on class-specific knowledge: 1) sample deletion; 2) sample learning; and 3) sample reserve. Thus, the metacognitive component decides what-to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn the training samples. When a new rule is added, the parameters of the new rule are assigned such that the rule has minimum overlapping with the adjacent rules as well as the localization property of the Gaussian rules is efficiently exploited. Performance of the McFIS is evaluated using several well-known benchmark multicategory/binary classification datasets from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository and on a practical human action recognition problem. The results clearly indicate that the proposed metacognitive learning helps the McFIS achieve better performance than other existing classifiers.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2242894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6420927","Classification;hinge-loss function;metacognition;neuro-fuzzy systems;self-regulatory learning","Fuzzy logic;Humans;Inference algorithms;Learning systems;Machine learning;Measurement uncertainty;Monitoring","Gaussian processes;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","Gaussian rules localization property;Irvine machine learning repository;McFIS learning algorithm;University of California;benchmark multicategory-binary classification datasets;classifiers;human action recognition problem;human learning strategy;metacognitive component;metacognitive neuro-fuzzy inference system;metacognitive sequential learning algorithm;sample deletion;sample learning;sample reserve;self-adaptive thresholds;self-regulatory learning strategy;sequential classification problems","","52","","90","","20130125","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we introduce an adaptive naïve Bayes tree (NBTree) algorithm for scaling up the classification accuracy of multi-class classification problems, which considers the attributes that are used in the decision tree for the calculation of the naïve assumption of class conditional independence. The NBTree is a hybrid classifier of decision tree and naïve Bayes classifiers. In NBTree nodes contain and split as regular decision tree, but the leaves are replaced by naïve Bayes classifier. We tested the performance of proposed algorithm against those of the existing decision tree and naïve Bayes classifiers respectively using the classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity-specificity analysis, and 10-fold cross validation on 10 real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improved the classification accuracy of real life challenging multi-class problems.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5180-2; POD:978-1-4799-5181-9","10.1109/ICIEV.2014.6850698","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6850698","Classification;NBTree;data mining;decision tree;naïve Bayes classifier","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Decision trees;Machine learning algorithms;Niobium;Training","Bayes methods;data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","10-fold cross validation;UCI machine learning repository;adaptive naïve Bayes tree algorithm;class conditional independence;classification accuracy;data mining;decision tree classifier;naïve Bayes classifier;scalable multiclass classification;sensitivity-specificity analysis","","1","","20","","","23-24 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is achieved by using image descriptors that interpret these variations as shifts in the feature vector. We model these variations as a covariate shift in the data. This shift is then reduced by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and estimated distributions using importance weights (IW). These IWs are used in support vector machines (SVMs) to formulate the IW-SVMs. The experimental results show that IW-SVMs exhibit good invariance characteristics and outperform other state-of-the-art classification methods. The proposed methodology gives a generic solution that can be applied to any texture descriptor that models the transformations as a shift in the feature vector.","1070-9908;10709908","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2302576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6722919","Covariate shift and support vector machines;rotation and scale invariance","Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Standards;Support vector machines;Testing;Training;Vectors","image classification;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","IW;Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation;SVM;covariate shift methodology;feature vector shift;image descriptor;importance weight;machine learning level;rotation invariant texture classification;scale invariant texture classification;support vector machine;texture descriptor","","2","","15","","20140124","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To keep the efficiency of these techniques, the training and adaptation schedule must be constant. In this paper we study the behaviour of an automatic updating perceptron, with variable training frequency and using as input samples with increasing freshness. Other variable parameters are the features set and training set dimensions. The collected samples, clean and malicious are from the last year. We conclude with the observed optimal parameters which can be used to obtain a good proactivity.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3036-4; POD:978-1-4799-3037-1","10.1109/SYNASC.2013.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821164","automatic update;malware detection;optimization;perceptron;proactivity","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Malware;Software;Training","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","adaptation schedule;automatic updating perceptron behavior;automatic updating perceptron-based system;machine learning techniques;malware detection;online threats;shape-shifting malware;training schedule;variable parameters;variable training frequency","","0","","10","","","23-26 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An adaptive method to determine the number of clusters in clustering process","H. Doan; D. T. Nguyen","HCM, Univ. of Inf. Technol., Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","2014 International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences (ICCOINS)","20140731","2014","","","1","6","A difficult problem of most clustering algorithms is how to specify the appropriate number of clusters. This paper proposes an adaptive method of selecting of number of clusters in clustering process by making coefficients indicated the appropriate number of clusters. The intra-cluster coefficient reflects intra distortion of cluster through maximum distance and a mean distance of cluster's extremely marginal objects. The inter-cluster coefficient reflects distance among clusters. It is ratio between closest distance from this cluster's centre to an extremely marginal object of other cluster and mean distance from this cluster's centre to all of extremely marginal object of other cluster respectively. A new coefficient that indicates the appropriate number of clusters is build from the intra-cluster coefficient and inter-cluster coefficient. The looking for extremely marginal objects and the new coefficient are integrated in a weighted FCM algorithm and it is calculated adaptively while the weighted FCM is processing. The weighted FCM algorithm integrated new coefficient is called FCM++. We experiment with FCM++ on some data sets of UCI: Iris, Wine, Soybean-small and show encouraging results.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4392-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-4390-6; POD:978-1-4799-4081-3","10.1109/ICCOINS.2014.6868373","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6868373","clustering algorithm;determine the number of clusters;fuzzy c-means","Buildings;Clustering algorithms;Computational complexity;Educational institutions;Iris;Machine learning algorithms;Market research","fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering","FCM++;Iris data set;Soybean-small data set;TICI data set;Wine data set;adaptive method;cluster intra distortion;cluster maximum distance;cluster mean distance;cluster number determination;clustering process;fuzzy c-means;intercluster coefficient;intracluster coefficient;weighted FCM algorithm","","1","","9","","","3-5 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
