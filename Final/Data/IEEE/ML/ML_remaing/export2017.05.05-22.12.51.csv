In this paper, we present an effective image-based CAPTCHA based on the orientation of N-gonal cropped sub-images as a solution of CAPTCHAs. Our CAPTCHA is based on the difficulty of detecting the orientation of N-gonal sub-images. In our CAPTCHA, the number of orientations and the crop size are important considerations, since our CAPTCHA requires users to find the orientation of sub-images cropped in the form of a regular polygon. So, we discuss usability of our CAPTCHA and the efficient values of the number of orientations and the crop size through user experiments and SVM-based machine learning tests in this paper.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7548-3; POD:978-1-4244-7547-6","10.1109/CIT.2010.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578156","Image-based CAPTCHA;Machine learning;Perceptual recognition;Random attack;Usability","Accuracy;Agriculture;Humans;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training;Usability","Web services;image processing","N-gonal cropped sub-images;SVM-based machine learning;completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart;image-based CAPTCHA;public Web services","","1","","18","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a great need for sharing the generated data sets to enable timely decision-making across various agencies/institutions. However, this requires tremendous efforts and coordination among different sensor network agencies to come to a shared understanding for disseminating the information in a uniform and standardized way. To address these needs and achieve interoperability, syntactic standardization provides to a certain extent the data description models. In addition, semantic enrichment of the information sources is also required to understand the context of the data. In this paper we adopt standardized data models based on the Open Geospatial Consoritum (OGC) sensor web enablement framework for coastal sensor networks, which facilitates improved information retrieval on a variety of spatio-temporal scales. The semantic enrichment is achieved in terms of conceptualization of selected sensor types and other terminology involved in the coastal domain in the form of Ontologies. A coastal semantic mapping (COSEM-Map) tool developed as a part of this work facilitates the harmonization of different representations. This ontological model is amenable to querying using SPARQL, which is a standardized RDF query language. Further, sensor web services discovery aspects have been addressed by augmenting the Universal Description, discovery and Integration (UDDI) registry with Web Ontology Language for Services (OWL-S) and using a semantic matching algorithm for services discovery. Both web-based and mobile-enabled clients were developed to process syntactic and semantic queries.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2056674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540243","Machine learning;mobile platform;ontology;sensor web;web services","Machine learning;Ocean temperature;Ontologies;Real time systems;Sea measurements;Semantics;Web services","Web services;atmospheric measuring apparatus;decision making;geophysics computing;middleware;oceanographic techniques;oceanography;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;remote sensing","COSEM-Map tool;OWL-S;Open Geospatial Consoritum sensor;SPARQL;UDDI registry;Universal Description, discovery and Integration;Web Ontology Language for Services;atmospheric measurements;coastal buoys;coastal semantic mapping;coastal sensor Web applications;decision making;high quality marine observations;interoperability;oceanography;ontologies;public safety;semantic queries;sensor network agencies;standardized RDF query language;standards-based middleware;syntactic standardization;weather service;web enablement framework","","14","","77","","20100805","Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The genetic-programming-based approach includes three strategies for modeling with multiple software projects: Baseline Classifier, Validation Classifier, and Validation-and-Voting Classifier. The latter is shown to provide better generalization and more robust software quality models. This is based on a case study of software metrics and defect data from seven real-world systems. A second case study considers 17 different (nonevolutionary) machine learners for modeling with multiple software data sets. Both case studies use a similar majority-voting approach for predicting fault-proneness class of program modules.

The use of the web as a corpus to support automating knowledge acquisition has been gaining in popularity in the recent years. This approach tends to introduce noise at the early stages of learning which can have a compounding impact on the quality of the final results. If the goal is to alleviate the expense of manual knowledge acquisition in the short term, a combination of automatic knowledge learning and human validation/correction must be considered. People can either post-edit automatically produced candidate knowledge elements or intervene at various stages in the acquisition process to facilitate high-quality automatic output.

Computer models are convenient tools for scanning pathogen genomes to preselect candidate immunogenic peptides for experimental validation. Current methods predict many false positives resulting from a low prevalence of true positives. We develop a test reject method based on the prediction uncertainty estimates determined by Gaussian process regression. This method filters false positives among predicted epitopes from a pathogen genome. The performance of stand-alone Gaussian process regression is compared to other state-of-the-art methods using cross validation on 11 benchmark data sets. The results show that the Gaussian process method has the same accuracy as the top performing algorithms. The combination of Gaussian process regression with the proposed test reject method is used to detect true epitopes from the Vaccinia virus genome. The test rejection increases the prediction accuracy by reducing the number of false positives without sacrificing the method's sensitivity. We show that the Gaussian process in combination with test rejection is an effective method for prediction of T-cell epitopes in large and diverse pathogen genomes, where false positives are of concern.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2008.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4695825","False positive;Gaussian processes;Immunology;Immunology, amino acid sequence, epitope, machine learning, Gaussian processes, regression, false positives.;Machine learning;Regression;amino acid sequence","Bioinformatics;Filters;Gaussian processes;Genomics;Immune system;Pathogens;Peptides;Testing;Uncertainty;Vaccines","Gaussian processes;drugs;genomics;microorganisms;regression analysis","Gaussian process regression;T-cell epitope detection;Vaccinia virus genome;computer models;false positives;immunogenic element;pathogen genomes;peptide-based vaccines;prediction uncertainty;test reject method;test rejection;true epitopes","Algorithms;Epitope Mapping;Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte;Genome, Viral;Normal Distribution;Vaccinia virus","2","","23","","20081209","October 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The learning procedure is performed by means of a expectation maximization (EM) methodology. The key feature of our approach is related to a top-down hierarchical search for the number of components, together with the integration of the model selection criterion within a modified EM procedure, used for the learning the mixture parameters. We start with a single component covering the whole data set. Then new components are added and optimized to best cover the data.

This unique source of data provides a rapid means of customer feedback that is used to support a number of business areas. Towards this purpose, we describe a methodology for the identification of topics associated with customer sentiment. This process first employs a Fisher Classification based approach towards sentiment analysis. By considering specific mutual information and word frequency distribution, topics are then identified within sentiment categories. The goal is to provide overall trends in sentiment along with associated subject matter (ie. why) as it supports a company's business.

No wonder automatic face expression recognition has become an area of immense interest within the computer science, psychology, medicine and human-computer interaction research communities. Various feature extraction techniques based on statistical to geometrical data have been used for recognition of expressions from static images as well as real time videos. In this paper we present a method for automatic recognition of facial expressions from face images by providing Texture features to a bank of five parallel Bayesian classifiers. Each Bayesian classifier is trained to recognize a particular facial expression, so that it is most sensitive to that expression. Multi-classification is achieved by combining multiple Bayesian classifiers each performing binary classification using one-against-all approach. The outputs of all classifiers are combined using a maximum function. The classification efficiency is tested on static images from the publicly available JAFFE database. The experiments using the proposed method demonstrate promising results.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8003-6; POD:978-1-4244-8001-2","10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625676","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625676","Classifier Combination;Facial Expressions;Machine Learning;Multiple Classifier Systems;Naïve Bayesian Classifier;Texture Analysis","Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Databases;Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Training","Bayes methods;face recognition;human computer interaction;image texture","Bayesian classifiers;JAFFE database;automatic recognition;computer science;facial expression recognition;geometrical data;human computer interaction;human face;persons emotional state;statistical data;texture analysis","","0","","24","","","14-16 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In response to this problem Pattern Based Algorithm is proposed which has high detection rate as well as low false alarm rate. In this algorithm decision stumps are used as weak classifier. The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features.

Due to the constraint of the communication bandwidth, only a limited number of information items may be transmitted upon a vehicle-to-vehicle communication opportunity. Ranking becomes critical in this situation, by enabling the most important information to be transmitted under the bandwidth constraint. In this paper we propose a method for online learning of spatio-temporal information ranking for a travel time dissemination application within a VANET. In this method, vehicles judge the relevance of incoming information items and use them as training examples for Naive Bayesian learning. Additionally, a separate machine learning algorithm is used to estimate the probability of a duplicate item being transmitted.

In addition, Arabic is a highly inflective language and is morphologically much more complex than languages written with Latin characters. One cannot, therefore, easily take for granted that using Boosting to automatically classify Arabic documents is as effective as it is with documents written in Latin characters.

The research about social structures and a conceptualization of group problem solving have a long and rich history. Heider, a founder of the theory of perceptual balance, defined the relationship between three notions (P, O, X) as “positive (+1),” “negative (-1)” and judged the “balance” or “imbalance” of the group by using the product of these three signs in this cycle. Cartwright and Harary expanded Heider's balance theory (structural balance) to the groups consist of more than three actors in order to explain more realistic social problems. We use these theories to social simulations. Furthermore, we adopt the idea of communication network and reinforce learning to the agents. The model simulates social actors making positive and negative selection of each other in efforts to reach balanced cognitive states. We observe the influence on dissimilarity or the formation of groups on our social simulations as a result of several communication networks and the ways of choosing communication partners, especially for sharing common perceptions, which influences their society.","2154-4824;21544824","Electronic:978-1-889335-42-1; POD:978-1-4244-9673-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5665677","Cognitive Theory;Machine Learning;Small World;Social Simulation","Cognition;Communication networks","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;problem solving;social sciences;telecommunication networks;virtual reality","Cartwright;Harary;Heider balance theory;cognitive balance;communication network;complex human relationship;interaction style;modern society;multiagent system;perception sharing;perceptual balance;problem solving;reinforce learning;social actor;social simulation;social structure;structural balance;virtual society","","0","","12","","","19-23 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thresholds of membership functions, weight vectors of membership degrees and classification thresholds were all learned by the proposed learning algorithm, according to the classification error minimization inductive principle. Experiments were conducted on two different test sets. The overall accuracies of the proposed algorithm are 97.70% and 96.20%, respectively.

These mask the statistical characteristics of traffic flows. Different algorithms and statistical features also affect the classification performance. In this paper, an approach for optimising the classifier has been presented, which uses independent binary detectors to handle different traffic types separately. Meanwhile, the algorithms and statistical features for detectors are optimised and the size of detection windows are also optimised in order to find the best detection periods for avoiding the statistical characteristics deteriorated by the overwhelming number of MTU packets.

The OAD covariance function makes use of the properties of the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) which is used frequently for classifying hyperspectral data. Results show that it is possible to identify and classify rocks in an `One vs. One' and an `One vs. All' approach using the entire spectral curve (0.35-2.5 μm). The results show an average classification accuracy of 98% and an F-score of 92% for the new method in an `One vs. All' approach. Slightly higher classification accuracy and F-measure for the new method can be achieved for the `One vs. One' binary approach.

In this paper, we will further show that the goal net model can simulate motivated learning of goal selections. More specifically, a reorganization algorithm is proposed to convert an original goal net to its counterpart that our learning algorithm can operate on.

However, the small feature size also suggests that the effect of process variations is more pronounced. In this paper, we design a mask that is robust against focus variations within the inverse lithography framework. Each iteration involves more computation than a similar method designed for the nominal conditions, but we simplify the task by using stochastic gradient descent, which is a technique from machine learning.

In this paper, we exclusively survey the fusion techniques used in various audiovisual information fusion tasks. The fusion strategy used tends to depend mainly on the model, probabilistic or otherwise, used in the particular task to process sensory information to obtain higher level semantic information. The models themselves are task oriented. In this paper, we describe the fusion strategies and the corresponding models used in audiovisual tasks such as speech recognition, tracking, biometrics, affective state recognition, and meeting scene analysis. We also review the challenges and existing solutions and also unresolved or partially resolved issues in these fields.

The allocation of advertisements based on both individual information and social relationships is becoming ever more important. In this study, we first propose the notion of social filtering and compare it with content-based filtering and collaborative filtering for advertisement allocation in a social network. Second, we apply content-boosted and social-boosted methods to enhance existing collaborating filtering models. Finally, an effective learning-based framework is proposed to combine filtering models to improve social advertising. The experiments are conducted based on datasets collected from a social finance web site called Morgenstern. We performed a series of comparison experiments between filtering approaches.

Based on generation/validation paradigm, we first segment images to detect character regions with a multiresolution algorithm able to manage large character size variations.

Prior to classification, given the high dimensionality of functional MRI (fMRI) data, a dimension reduction stage comprising two steps is performed: first, a one-sample univariate t-test mean-difference <i>T</i><sub>score</sub> approach is used to reduce the number of significant discriminative functional activated voxels, and then singular value decomposition is performed to further reduce the dimension of the input patterns to a number comparable to the limited number of subjects available for each of the three classes.

However, this master node also manages communications between all the other system nodes, and in that sense it is a peer-to-peer architecture. It is a loosely-coupled system in that node slaves only know about the existence of the master node, and are only concerned with their work load (portion of the terrain). As part of this architecture, we show how agents are allowed to communicate with other agents in the same or different nodes and share information that pertains to all agents, including the agent obstacle barriers. In particular, one main contribution of the paper is multi-agent reenforcement learning in a distributed system, where the agents do not have complete knowledge and information of their environment, other than what is available on the computing node, the particular agent (s) is (are) running on.

A foreground object in the first frame is segmented by training the CRF on user interaction, i.e., by using user scribbles corresponding to foreground and background respectively for CRF training. The data term of the energy function in this CRF framework is designed as a function of the score of texture-color classifier trained by AdaBoost. From the second frame, a weighted data term that encodes the shape of the object is added to this energy function. The boundary pixels of the current frame are predicted by the optical flow, and a smaller cost is given to a pixel closer to the boundary and vice versa. Also, a confidence of optical flow is defined, and a larger weight is given to the data term when the confident is high. As a result, the data term related with the shape becomes important when the motion estimation is reliable, and conversely the color-texture term becomes important otherwise. Experimental results show that the proposed data term keeps the boundary correctly in most cases and provides comparable result when compared to a state-of-the-art method.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4244-7994-8; POD:978-1-4244-7992-4; USB:978-1-4244-7993-1","10.1109/ICIP.2010.5650802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5650802","AdaBoost;machine learning;object segmentation;optical flow;shape tracking","Adaptive optics;Image segmentation;Object segmentation;Optical imaging;Pixel;Shape;Video sequences","feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);motion estimation;object tracking","CRF;adaboost classifier;color texture;conditional random field;feature learning;motion estimation;shape tracking;video object segmentation","","1","","13","","","26-29 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though HSC can be extended to deal with high dimensional data with dimension reduction or ensemble techniques, it is not trivial to tackle high dimensional data directly. Inspired by the decision tree idea, an improvement of HSC is proposed to deal with high dimensional data directly in this work. Furthermore, we parallelize the improved HSC algorithm (PHSC) to handle large scale high dimensional data based on MapReduce framework, which is a current and powerful parallel programming technique used in many fields.

"Massive-Training Artificial Neural Network Coupled With Laplacian-Eigenfunction-Based Dimensionality Reduction for Computer-Aided Detection of Polyps in CT Colonography","K. Suzuki; J. Zhang; J. Xu","Department of Radiology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","20101101","2010","29","11","1907","1917","A major challenge in the current computer-aided detection (CAD) of polyps in CT colonography (CTC) is to reduce the number of false-positive (FP) detections while maintaining a high sensitivity level. A pattern-recognition technique based on the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) as a filter, which is called a massive-training ANN (MTANN), has been developed recently for this purpose. The MTANN is trained with a massive number of subvolumes extracted from input volumes together with the teaching volumes containing the distribution for the “likelihood of being a polyp;” hence the term “massive training.” Because of the large number of subvolumes and the high dimensionality of voxels in each input subvolume, the training of an MTANN is time-consuming. In order to solve this time issue and make an MTANN work more efficiently, we propose here a dimension reduction method for an MTANN by using Laplacian eigenfunctions (LAPs), denoted as LAP-MTANN. Instead of input voxels, the LAP-MTANN uses the dependence structures of input voxels to compute the selected LAPs of the input voxels from each input subvolume and thus reduces the dimensions of the input vector to the MTANN. Our database consisted of 246 CTC datasets obtained from 123 patients, each of whom was scanned in both supine and prone positions. Seventeen patients had 29 polyps, 15 of which were 5-9 mm and 14 were 10-25 mm in size. We divided our database into a training set and a test set. The training set included 10 polyps in 10 patients and 20 negative patients. The test set had 93 patients including 19 polyps in seven patients and 86 negative patients. To investigate the basic properties of a LAP-MTANN, we trained the LAP-MTANN with actual polyps and a single source of FPs, which were rectal tubes. We applied the trained LAP-MTANN to simulated polyps and rectal tubes. The results showed that the performance of LAP-MTANNs with 20 LAPs was advantageous over that of the origi- al MTANN with 171 inputs. To test the feasibility of the LAP-MTANN, we compared the LAP-MTANN with the original MTANN in the distinction between actual polyps and various types of FPs. The original MTANN yielded a 95% (18/19) by-polyp sensitivity at an FP rate of 3.6 (338/93) per patient, whereas the LAP-MTANN achieved a comparable performance, i.e., an FP rate of 3.9 (367/93) per patient at the same sensitivity level. With the use of the dimension reduction architecture, the time required for training was reduced from 38 h to 4 h. The classification performance in terms of the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve of the LAP-MTANN (0.84) was slightly higher than that of the original MTANN (0.82) with no statistically significant difference (p-value= 0.48).","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2010.2053213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491180","Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD);nonlinear dimension reduction;pixel-based machine learning;virtual colonoscopy","Artificial neural networks;Colonic polyps;Computer networks;Databases;Education;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Filters;Laplace equations;Testing;Virtual colonoscopy","cancer;computerised tomography;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;medical image processing;neural nets;pattern recognition;sensitivity analysis","CT colonography;LAP-MTANN;Laplacian eigenfunction;computer-aided detection;dimensionality reduction;false-positive detections;filter;input voxels;massive-training artificial neural network;pattern recognition;polyps;receiver-operating-characteristic curve;rectal tubes","Algorithms;Colonic Polyps;Colonography, Computed Tomographic;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","23","","46","","20100621","Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We extract a set of anaphora ambiguities from a range of requirements documents, and collect multiple human judgments on their interpretations. The judgment distribution is used to determine if an ambiguity is nocuous or innocuous. We investigate a number of antecedent preference heuristics that we use to explore aspects of anaphora which may lead a reader to favour a particular interpretation. Using machine learning techniques, we build an automated tool to predict the antecedent preference of noun phrase candidates, which in turn is used to identify nocuous ambiguity. We report on a series of experiments that we conducted to evaluate the performance of our automated system. The results show that the system achieves high recall with a consistent improvement on baseline precision subject to some ambiguity tolerance levels, allowing us to explore and highlight realistic and potentially problematic ambiguities in actual requirements documents.","1090-705X;1090705X","Electronic:978-0-7695-4162-4; POD:978-1-4244-8022-7","10.1109/RE.2010.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636921","NL requirements;anaphora ambiguity;antecedent preference heuristics;machine learning;nocuous ambiguity","Context;Humans;Manuals;Pragmatics;Prototypes;Semantics;Syntactics","formal specification;formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages;systems analysis","anaphora;antecedent preference heuristics;automated system;baseline precision;human judgment;judgment distribution;machine learning technique;natural language requirement;nocuous ambiguity analysis;noun phrase;requirements document","","10","","25","","","Sept. 27 2010-Oct. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies a new setting of missing data imputation, i.e., imputing missing data in data sets with heterogeneous attributes (their independent attributes are of different types), referred to as imputing mixed-attribute data sets. Although many real applications are in this setting, there is no estimator designed for imputing mixed-attribute data sets. This paper first proposes two consistent estimators for discrete and continuous missing target values, respectively. And then, a mixture-kernel-based iterative estimator is advocated to impute mixed-attribute data sets.

Firstly, the appropriate eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the set of eyes images are selected by comparing the value of the classification accuracy. Secondly, the threshold for the classifier is determined by using the selected eigenvectors and the accuracy. Lastly, the unknown image region is projected into the selected eigenvectors having the largest accuracy, and the absolute values of the projection coefficients and the corresponding accuracy can be expressed as the total sum of products, which is compared with the threshold to determine whether the unknown region contains the human eye. The algorithm is called the AWPCA because the projection coefficient is multiplied by the accuracy. The performance of our automatic eye location technique is subsequently validated by using the CAS-PEAL database. The experiment results show that the AWPCA algorithm may locate eye more effectively than the original PCA algorithm based on the reconstruction error, especially for the face images with glasses.","2164-5221;21645221","Electronic:978-1-4244-5900-1; POD:978-1-4244-5897-4","10.1109/ICOSP.2010.5656725","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5656725","Eye location;Machine learning;the Accuracy-Weighted Principal Component Analysis(A WPCA)","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Face;Face recognition;Principal component analysis;Training","computer vision;covariance matrices;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;face recognition;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis","AWPCA algorithm;CAS-PEAL database;accuracy-weighted principal component analysis;automatic eye location technique;automatic face recognition;automatic facial feature location;computer vision;covariance matrix;eigenvectors;eye image location;image reconstruction error;image region;machine learning;projection coefficients","","0","","9","","","24-28 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our previous researches we showed that the foundry process can be modelled as an expert knowledge cloud to anticipate the value of the UTS with outstanding results.

The algorithm produces correct segmentations even in the presence of large background motion with a nearly stationary foreground. This research makes three key contributions: First, we introduce a novel motion representation, referred to as “motons,” inspired by research in object recognition. Second, we propose estimating the segmentation likelihood from the spatial context of motion. The estimation is efficiently learned by random forests. Third, we introduce a general taxonomy of tree-based classifiers that facilitates both theoretical and experimental comparisons of several known classification algorithms and generates new ones. In our bilayer segmentation algorithm, diverse visual cues such as motion, motion context, color, contrast, and spatial priors are fused by means of a conditional random field (CRF) model. Segmentation is then achieved by binary min-cut. Experiments on many sequences of our videochat application demonstrate that our algorithm, which requires no initialization, is effective in a variety of scenes, and the segmentation results are comparable to those obtained by stereo systems.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432210","Computer vision;boosting;decision tree;image understanding;machine learning;motion analysis.;random forests","Cameras;Classification algorithms;Classification tree analysis;Image segmentation;Lighting;Motion estimation;Object recognition;Robustness;Taxonomy;Videos","computer vision;decision trees;image classification;image motion analysis;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation;object recognition;video communication;video signal processing","bilayer segmentation;computer vision;conditional random field;decision tree;image motion analysis;image understanding;likelihood estimation;machine learning;monocular Webcam video;object recognition;stereo camera;tree based classifier","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Motion;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Video Recording","20","","39","","20100318","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a proof of concept, a thorough evaluation of automatic classification of short circuits in transmission lines is discussed. Simulations with different preprocessing (e.g., wavelets) and learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machines) are presented.

Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) is an indicator showing how well the constellation of GPS satellites is geometrically organized. GPS positioning with a low GDOP value usually gains better accuracy. However, the calculation of GDOP is a time- and power-consuming task that involves complicated transformation and inversion of measurement matrices. When selecting from many GPS constellations the one with the lowest GDOP for positioning, methods that can fast and accurately obtain GPS GDOP are imperative. Previous studies have shown that numerical regression on GPS GDOP can get satisfactory results and save many calculation steps. This paper deals with the approximation of GPS GDOP using statistics and machine learning methods. The technique of support vector machines (SVMs) is mainly focused. This study compares the performance of several methods, such as linear regression, pace regression, isotonic regression, SVM, artificial neural networks, and genetic programming (GP). The experimental results show that SVM and GP have better performance than others.","0018-9456;00189456","","10.1109/TIM.2010.2049228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467147","Computational intelligence;Global Positioning System (GPS);Kernel-based method;genetic programming (GP);geometric dilution of precision (GDOP);machine learning;neural networks;regression;support vector machine (SVM)","Artificial neural networks;Clocks;Genetic programming;Global Positioning System;Learning systems;Radio navigation;Receivers;Satellite broadcasting;Satellite navigation systems;Support vector machines","Global Positioning System;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;support vector machines","GPS GDOP approximation;SVM;artificial neural networks;genetic programming;geometric dilution of precision;isotonic regression;linear regression;pace regression;support-vector machines","","23","","33","","20100520","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We introduce in this paper a novel image retrieval framework based on a new class of kernels referred to as “network-dependent”. The main contribution of our method includes (i) a variational framework which helps designing a kernel using both the intrinsic image features and the underlying contextual informations resulting from different (e.g. social) links and (ii) the proof of convergence of the kernel to a fixed-point, that is positive definite and thus associated with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).

However, to obtain performance improvements, the computational requirements are heavily increased because of the need to train the ANN. Departing from the observation of the remarkable skewness of speech data, this paper proposes sifting out the training set and balancing the amount of samples per class. With this method, the training time has been reduced 18 times while obtaining performances similar to or even better than those with the whole database, especially in noisy environments. However, the application of these reduced sets is not straightforward. To avoid the mismatch between training and testing conditions created by the modification of the distribution of the training data, a proper scaling of the a posteriori probabilities obtained and a resizing of the context window need to be performed as demonstrated in this paper.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2010.2050513","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466113","ANN/HMM;Active learning;MLP/HMM;additive noise;artificial neural networks (ANNs);hidden Markov models (HMMs);hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR);machine learning;multilayer perceptrons (MLPs);robust ASR","Artificial neural networks;Automatic speech recognition;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Noise reduction;Speech recognition;State estimation;Testing;Training data;Working environment noise","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);speech recognition","Gaussian mixture models;a posteriori probability;artificial neural networks;data balancing;hidden Markov models;hybrid ANN/HMM automatic speech recognition;training set","","7","","61","","20100518","March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For efficient User-centric management it is imperative to have a precise metric for perceived quality. Quality of Experience (QoE) is such a metric, which captures many different aspects that compose the perception of quality. The drawback of using QoE is that due to its subjectiveness, accurate measurement necessitates execution of cumbersome subjective studies. In this work we propose a method that uses Machine Learning techniques to build QoE prediction models based on limited subjective data. Using those models we have developed an algorithm that generates the remedies for improving the QoE of observed multimedia stream. Selecting the optimal remedy is done by comparing the costs in resources associated to each of them. Coupling the QoE estimation and calculation of remedies produces a tool for effective implementation of a User-centric management loop for multimedia streaming services.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4141-9; POD:978-1-4244-7778-4","10.1109/CENTRIC.2010.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5600357","Machine Learning;QoE;Quality of Experience;Subjective Testing","Classification algorithms;Distortion measurement;Estimation;Multimedia communication;Predictive models;Quality of service;Streaming media","learning (artificial intelligence);media streaming;quality of service","QoE prediction model;machine learning techniques;multimedia network service management;multimedia streaming services;quality of experience;user-centric management loop","","4","","15","","","22-27 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a simple and efficient algorithm-called EXAMCE-for this class of problems that is inspired from a Set-Partitioning formulation of the original clustering problem. We prove some theoretical properties of the solutions produced by our algorithm, and in particular that, under general assumptions, though the algorithm recombines solution fragments so as to find the solution of a Set-Covering relaxation of the original formulation, it is guaranteed to find better solutions than the ones in the ensemble. For the MSSC problem in particular, a prototype implementation of our algorithm found a new better solution than the previously best known for 21 of the test instances of the 40-instance TSPLIB benchmark data sets used in, and and found a worse-quality solution than the best known only five times. For other published benchmark data sets where the optimal MSSC solution is known, we match them. The algorithm is particularly effective when the number of clusters is large, in which case it is able to escape the local minima found by K-means type algorithms by recombining the solutions in a Set-Covering context. We also establish the stability of the algorithm with extensive computational experiments, by showing that multiple runs of EXAMCE for the same clustering problem instance produce high-quality solutions whose Adjusted Rand Index is consistently above 0.95. Finally, in experiments utilizing external criteria to compute the validity of clustering, EXAMCE is capable of producing high-quality results that are comparable in quality to those of the best known clustering algorithms.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444880","Clustering;combinatorial algorithms.;constrained optimization;machine learning","","algorithm theory;data handling;relaxation theory;set theory","K-means type algorithm;TSPLIB benchmark data set;adjusted Rand index;cluster ensemble;clustering algorithm;exact method;minimum-sum-of-squares-clustering;optimization-based method;set-covering context;set-covering relaxation;set-partitioning formulation","","14","","33","","20100408","Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we use a distributed host based traffic collection platform (DHTCP) to gather traffic samples with accurate application information on user hosts. Then probabilistic neural network was used to traffic classification. Web and P2P traffics were studied since they are the most predominant internet traffic types. experimental results show that probabilistic neural network is an effective machine learning technique for traffic identification.","2157-9555;21579555","Electronic:978-1-4244-5961-2; POD:978-1-4244-5958-2","10.1109/ICNC.2010.5584648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5584648","Machine learning;Probabilistic neural network;Traffic classification","Artificial neural networks;Internet;Machine learning;Probabilistic logic;Servers;Support vector machines;Training","Internet;computer network management;cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;peer-to-peer computing;probability;telecommunication traffic","Internet applications;P2P traffics;Web traffics;distributed host based traffic collection platform;dynamic port number;encryption techniques;machine learning based techniques;network management;neural computation techniques;passive network measurement;payload-based techniques;port-based techniques;probabilistic neural networks;traffic classification techniques;traffic identification","","10","","28","","","10-12 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
