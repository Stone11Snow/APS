Then SVMs are used to model each of the subseries so as to achieve more accurate forecast respectively. Finally, the forecasts of all subseries are aggregated by a SVMs model to formulate an ensemble forecast for the erratic demand series.

Hourly cooling load forecasting is a difficult work as the load at a given point is dependent not only on the load at the previous hour but also on the load at the same hour on the previous day. So the accuracy of forecasting is influenced by many unpredicted factors. Support vector machine (SVM) is a novel type of learning machine, which has been successfully employed to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. The key problem of SVM is the selection of SVM free parameters. In this paper, it is proposed a new optimal model, which is based on Simulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (SAPSO) that combines the advantages of PSO algorithm and SA algorithm. The strong searching ability of SA was employed to PSO algorithm to avoid the premature convergence with better stability and astringency. The SA based PSO algorithm was used to optimize the free parameters of SVM model. The study used the proposed model to forecast load of cooling load system.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for supervised dictionary learning (SDLM) which seamlessly combines an unsupervised model (a Gaussian Mixture Model) and a supervised model (a logistic regression model) in a probabilistic framework. In the model, image category information directly affects the generation of a dictionary. A dictionary obtained by this approach is a trade-off between minimization of distortions of clusters and maximization of discriminative power of image-wise representations, i.e. histogram representations of images. We further extend the model to incorporate spatial information during the dictionary learning process in a spatial pyramid matching like manner.

As kernel machines are difficult to scale to large training sets, it has been proposed to perform an explicit mapping of the data and to learn directly linear classifiers in the new space. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning image categorizers on large image sets (e.g. > 100k images) using bag-of-visual-words (BOV) image representations and Support Vector Machine classifiers. We experiment with three approaches to BOV embedding: 1) kernel PCA (kPCA), 2) a modified kPCA we propose for additive kernels and 3) random projections for shift-invariant kernels. We report experiments on 3 datasets: Cal-tech101, VOC07 and ImageNet. An important conclusion is that simply square-rooting BOV vectors - which corresponds to an exact mapping for the Bhattacharyya kernel - already leads to large improvements, often quite close to the best results obtained with additive kernels.

We show how structured estimation methods from machine learning can be used to combine such variants into a single version of graph matching.

This paper seeks to address the problem related to the design of PP index functions for the linear feature extraction case. We achieve this using an evolutionary search framework, capable of building new indices to fit the properties of the available datasets. The high expressive power of this framework is sustained by a rich set of function primitives.

Applying data mining and machine learning techniques to network intrusion detection often faces the problem of very large training dataset size. For example, the training dataset commonly used for the DARPA KDD-1999 offline intrusion detection project contained approximately five hundred thousand (10% sample of the original five million) observations, which were used to build intrusion detection classification models. The practical problems associated with such a large dataset include very long model training times, redundant information, and increased complexity in understanding the domain-specific data. We demonstrate that a simple active learning procedure can dramatically reduce the size of the training data, without significantly sacrificing the classification accuracy of the intrusion detection model. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 intrusion detection project is used in our work. The network traffic instances are classified into one of two categories - normal and attack. A comparison of the actively trained neural network model with a C4.5 decision tree indicated that the actively learned model had better generalization accuracy. In addition, the training data classification performance of the actively learned model was comparable to that of the C4.5 decision tree.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8099-9; POD:978-1-4244-8097-5","10.1109/IRI.2010.5558967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558967","","Artificial neural networks;Biological system modeling;Data models;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Training;Training data","data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","C4.5 decision tree;DARPA KDD-1999;active learning;computer network intrusion detection;data mining;machine learning techniques;network traffic instances;neural networks;very large training dataset size","","6","","29","","","4-6 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then learn to rank the object hypotheses by training a continuous model to predict how plausible the segments are, given their mid-level region properties. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC09 segmentation dataset. It achieves the same average best segmentation covering as the best performing technique to date, 0.61 when using just the top 7 ranked segments, instead of the full hierarchy in.

An ensemble of the reduced datasets based on these rules is used as the inputs to ANN classifier with back propagation algorithm.

We represent each image using one set of binary latent features that model the image-specific covariance and a separate set that model the mean.

In this paper, a new algorithm TFEL (Threshold for Each Label) is proposed. An optimal threshold will be set for each label by learning from the training data set.

We propose here a compositional method for multiple kernels. The new composed kernel matrix is an extension and union of the original kernel matrices. Generally, multiple kernels approaches relied heavily on the training data and had to learn some weights to indicate the importance of each kernel. Our compositional method avoids learning any weight and the importance of the kernel functions are directly derived in the process of learning kernel machines. The performance of the proposed compositional kernel method is illustrated by some experiments in comparison with single kernel.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7164-5; POD:978-1-4244-7162-1","10.1109/ICCDA.2010.5540918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540918","kernel function;multiple kernel learning;support vector machine","Automation;Data analysis;Kernel;Lagrangian functions;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;support vector machines","compositional kernel method;kernel matrix;kernel-based learning algorithms;multiple kernels","","0","","12","","","25-27 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fast implementation of the existing methods is of great economical importance. Almost all categories of weed seeds have different size, shape and texture, and even the same species are quantitatively diverse in feature. Therefore, feature extraction is a tough, time consuming and labor-intensive task. In this paper, we use the compressive sensing theory, which has been applied to the field of machine learning, to do some dimension reduction treatment such as principle component analysis, downsampling and random projection to avoid careful selection of the feature set. As long as the dimension of the extracted features is beyond the theoretical threshold, we can achieve the desired classification results. It is worth mentioning that on account of humidity, bacteria and many other factors,the seeds are prone to have mould blocks or scabs. Thus, it is extremely necessary to do some simulations like contiguous occlusion.

This paper presents two SVM-based learning approaches for target tracking using WSNs. In the first approach, a black-box relationship between the acoustic measurements and the location of object is learned using least-square support vector regression (LSSVR). The other approach is multi-class classification with cell decomposition, which employ posterior probability regression with Platt's method to learn the sensor model. We describe both approaches and evaluate their performance in terms of the accuracy and robustness.

We propose a novel solution which uses a machine learning approach to generate confidence scores for each system for every instance of decision by implicitly modelling the redundancy (all classifiers making the same decision) and diversity (each classifier making a different decision and only a subset of classifiers is right at one time)from the training data. These confidence scores are used as weights for votes and the final decision is made using weighted sum of votes. Experimental results are provided by comparing this method with more conventional methods like majority voting, and majority voting with confidence.

The proposed algorithm is based on well-established machine learning and numerical analysis techniques, without making any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. It is capable of processing many thousands of features within minutes on a personal computer while maintaining a very high accuracy that is nearly insensitive to a growing number of irrelevant features.

Imperfect search results frequently appear due to the mismatch between the textual features and the actual visual content. Visual reranking, in which visual information is applied to refine text based search results, has been proven to be effective. However, the improvement brought by visual reranking is limited, and the main reason is that the errors in the text-based results will propagate to the refinement stage. In this paper, we propose a Content-Aware Ranking model based on “learning to rank” framework, in which textual and visual information are simultaneously leveraged in the ranking learning process. We formulate the Content-Aware Ranking based on large margin structured output learning, by modeling the visual information into a regularization term. The direct optimization of the learning problem is nearly infeasible since the number of constraints is huge. The efficient cutting plane algorithm is adopted to learn the model by iteratively adding the most violated constraints. Extensive experimental results on a large-scale dataset collected from a commercial Web image search engine, as well as the TRECVID 2007 video search dataset, demonstrate that the proposed ranking model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ranking and reranking methods.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4244-6985-7; POD:978-1-4244-6984-0","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540003","","Asia;Chaos;Constraint optimization;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Search engines;Video sharing","learning (artificial intelligence);search engines","content-aware ranking model;image search engines;learning problem;learning to rank framework;ranking learning process;regularization term;text based search;textual information;video search engines;visual content;visual information;visual reranking;visual search","","20","1","26","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new swap-based local search algorithm, Smart Swap, which preserves the stability of the previous solutions but is more efficient. It performs the swap by finding the nearest pair among the centroids and sorting the clusters by their distortion values. Then it swaps one of the nearest pair centroids to any position in that cluster. K-means iteration is employed to repartition the dataset and to fine-tune the swapped solution. The algorithm is easy to implement and iterates less than the previous swap-based local search algorithms. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm keeps at least 97% stability for the synthetic datasets and 0.577 of standard deviation for the real data. It is also much faster than the other swap-based algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6878-2; POD:978-1-4244-6876-8; USB:978-1-4244-6877-5","10.1109/ICGCS.2010.5543022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5543022","","Clustering algorithms;Computational efficiency;Cost function;Data mining;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern recognition;Sorting;Stability","computational complexity;iterative methods;pattern clustering;search problems","deterministic swap-based clustering;k-means iteration;randomized swap-based clustering;smart swap algorithm;swap-based local search algorithm","","0","","7","","","21-23 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main reason for this shortcoming is explained by the fact that even if dynamic Bayesian networks encode statistical relationships; they are not embedded in a Euclidean space where mathematical structures abound. The goal is to embed DBNs into a Euclidean space such that these topological features can be exploited. This extension of DBNs to topological DBNs (TDBNs) leapfrogs the task of pattern recognition and machine learning by not only classifying objects but revealing how they are related topologically. We have applied the TDBN formalism to facial aging for person identification. Preliminary results reveal that the TDBNs outperform the traditional DBN with an accuracy margin of 8% in average.","2160-7508;21607508","Electronic:978-1-4244-7030-3; POD:978-1-4244-7029-7","10.1109/CVPRW.2010.5543817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5543817","","Aging;Bayesian methods;Cognitive robotics;Face;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Machine learning;Network topology;Pattern recognition;Statistics","belief networks;biometrics (access control);face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);topology","Euclidean space;facial aging;human face identification;machine learning;object classification;pattern recognition;person identification;topological dynamic Bayesian networks","","2","","15","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The implementations have so far been in software, limiting their speed and power efficiency. Photonics could be an excellent platform for a hardware implementation of this concept because of its inherent parallelism and unique nonlinear behaviour. We propose using a network of coupled Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOA) and show in simulation that it could be used as a reservoir by comparing it on a benchmark speech recognition task to conventional software implementations.

As a result, the user obtains pixelwise labelled video sequences along with the class probabilities at each pixel. Our novel algorithm provides an essential tool to reduce tedious hand labelling of video sequences, thus producing copious amounts of useable ground truth data. A novel application of this algorithm is in semi-supervised learning of discriminative classifiers for video segmentation and scene parsing. The label propagation scheme can be based on pixel-wise correspondences obtained from motion estimation, image patch based similarities as seen in epitomic models or even the more recent, semantically consistent hierarchical regions. We compare the abilities of each of these variants, both via quantitative and qualitative studies against ground truth data. We then report studies on a state of the art Random forest classifier based video segmentation scheme, trained using fully ground truth data and with data obtained from label propagation.

The principal benefit of our method is that it can be applied without human intervention to a particular application or data set, learning the specific invariances necessary for excellent feature performance on that data. Our algorithm relies on the ability to track image patches over time using optical flow. With the wide availability of high frame rate video (eg: on the web, from a robot), good tracking is straightforward to achieve. The algorithm then optimizes feature parameters such that patches corresponding to the same physical location have feature descriptors that are as similar as possible while simultaneously maximizing the distinctness of descriptors for different locations. Thus, our method captures data or application specific invariances yet does not require any manual supervision. We apply our algorithm to learn domain-optimized versions of SIFT and HOG. SIFT and HOG features are excellent and widely used. However, they are general and by definition not tailored to a specific domain. Our domain-optimized versions offer a substantial performance increase for classification and correspondence tasks we consider. Furthermore, we show that the features our method learns are near the optimal that would be achieved by directly optimizing the test set performance of a classifier. Finally, we demonstrate that the learning often allows fewer features to be used for some tasks, which has the potential to dramatically improve computational concerns for very large data sets.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4244-6985-7; POD:978-1-4244-6984-0","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539773","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539773","","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Image motion analysis;Laboratories;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization methods;Streaming media;Surgery;Testing;Unsupervised learning","feature extraction;image sequences;unsupervised learning;video signal processing","HOG feature;SIFT feature;feature descriptors;high frame rate video;image patches;invariant features learning;optical flow;unsupervised learning","","12","","31","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The effectiveness of the transfer is affected by the relationship between source and target. Rather than improving the learning, brute force leveraging of a source poorly related to the target may decrease the classifier performance. One strategy to reduce this negative transfer is to import knowledge from multiple sources to increase the chance of finding one source closely related to the target. This work extends the boosting framework for transferring knowledge from multiple sources. Two new algorithms, MultiSource-TrAdaBoost, and TaskTrAdaBoost, are introduced, analyzed, and applied for object category recognition and specific object detection.

IPSO inherits the incremental learning ability of AIS. In IPSO, training data is presented to the algorithm one by one, and the training proceed is a one-shot incremental algorithm. Besides, the swarm does not converge to a single solution; instead, each particle is a part of the classifier, and the whole memory population is taken as the integral classifier to the problem. Compared the results of standard PSO and IPSO in several benchmark problems from the UCI data sets, we found that IPSO achieved a better classification accuracy than standard PSO in most cases.

In this paper, by adopting the idea of hierarchical clustering, we propose a new adaptive fuzzy clustering algorithm A-FCM that can determine the optimal cluster number automatically and efficiently.

The family includes the intersection, Hellinger's, and χ<sup>2</sup> kernels commonly employed in computer vision. Using the framework we are able to: (i) provide explicit feature maps for all homogeneous additive kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; (ii) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on the Fourier sampling theorem; and (iii) quantify the extent of the approximation. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernel on a number of standard datasets, yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVM implementations. We show that the χ<sup>2</sup> kernel, which has been found to yield the best performance in most applications, also has the most compact feature representation.

To overcome the deficiencies of traditional traffic classification methods with port mapping and signature matching, several machine learning techniques were proposed. However, there are two main challenges for classifying network traffic using machine learning method. Firstly, labeled samples are scarce and difficult to obtain. Secondly, not all types of applications are known a priori, and new ones may appear over time. To address the above-mentioned problems, This paper proposed a semi-supervised classification method that allows classifier to be designed from training dataset consisting of a few labeled and many unlabeled samples. This method consist two steps: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) clustering algorithm was employed to partition a training dataset that mixed few labeled samples with abundant unlabeled samples. Then, available labeled samples were used to map the clusters to the application classes. Two host features: IP Address Discreteness and Success Rate of Connections had been proposed and used in this paper.

In this paper, we used a corpus of behavioral data of judgments on different trait dimensions to automatically learn a trait predictor from facial pixel images.

Traditional methods based on machine learning or computer vision are still in the stage of tackling hundreds of object categories.

However, due to the limited dataset size and imperfect image crawling strategy, previous work can only address a biased small subset of image concepts. Here we introduce the Arista project, which aims to build a practical image annotation engine targeting at popular concepts in the real world. In this project, we are particularly interested in understanding how many image concepts can be addressed by the data-driven annotation approach (coverage) and how good the performance is (precision). This paper reports the first stage of the work. Two billions web images were indexed, and based on simple yet effective near-duplicate detection, the system is capable of automatically generating accurate tags for popular web images having near-duplicates in the database. We found that about 8.1% web images have more than ten near duplicate and the number increases to 28.5% for top images in search results.

We consider the problem where at each iteration the active learner must select a set of examples meeting a given budget of supervision, where the budget is determined by the funds (or time) available to spend on annotation. We formulate the budgeted selection task as a continuous optimization problem where we determine which subset of possible queries should maximize the improvement to the classifier's objective, without overspending the budget. To ensure far-sighted batch requests, we show how to incorporate the predicted change in the model that the candidate examples will induce.

In the standard approach, a boundary detector is trained by minimizing its pixel-level disagreement with human boundary tracings. This naive metric is problematic because it is overly sensitive to boundary locations. This problem is solved by metrics provided with the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset, but these can be insensitive to topological differences, such as gaps in boundaries. Furthermore, the Berkeley metrics have not been useful as cost functions for supervised learning. Using concepts from digital topology, we propose a new metric called the warping error that tolerates disagreements over boundary location, penalizes topological disagreements, and can be used directly as a cost function for learning boundary detection, in a method that we call Boundary Learning by Optimization with Topological Constraints (BLOTC). We trained boundary detectors on electron microscopic images of neurons, using both BLOTC and standard training. BLOTC produced substantially better performance on a 1.2 million pixel test set, as measured by both the warping error and the Rand index evaluated on segmentations generated from the boundary labelings.

An effective solution for defining such a metric is to learn it from a set of labeled training samples. In this work, we propose a fast and scalable algorithm to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric. The Mahalanobis metric can be viewed as the Euclidean distance metric on the input data that have been linearly transformed. By employing the principle of margin maximization to achieve better generalization performances, this algorithm formulates the metric learning as a convex optimization problem and a positive semidefinite (p.s.d.) matrix is the unknown variable. Based on an important theorem that a p.s.d. trace-one matrix can always be represented as a convex combination of multiple rank-one matrices, our algorithm accommodates any differentiable loss function and solves the resulting optimization problem using a specialized gradient descent procedure. During the course of optimization, the proposed algorithm maintains the positive semidefiniteness of the matrix variable that is essential for a Mahalanobis metric. Compared with conventional methods like standard interior-point algorithms or the special solver used in large margin nearest neighbor , our algorithm is much more efficient and has a better performance in scalability.

Among a gamut of technical solutions, cognitive approaches have long been perceived as a catalyst for the above goals by facilitating the coexistence of primary and secondary users by means of efficient dynamic spectrum management. While most available techniques today are essentially opportunistic in nature, a truly cognitive device needs to exhibit a certain degree of intelligence to draw optimum decisions based on prior observations and anticipated actions. Said intelligence however, comes along with high complexity and poor convergence, which currently prevents any viable deployment of cognitive networks. We thus introduce an emerging and largely unexplored concept of docitive networks, where nodes effectively teach other nodes with the prime aims of reducing cognitive complexity, speeding up the learning process, and drawing better and more reliable decisions. To this end, we review some important concepts borrowed from the machine learning community for both centralized and decentralized systems, in order to position the emerging docitive with known cognitive approaches. Finally, we validate introduced concepts in the context of a primary digital television system dynamically coexisting with IEEE 802.22 secondary networks.

Furthermore, two kernel-view extensions of this method are provided to handle the situations where descriptors and similarity functions are in the form of kernel matrices. We then investigate into two applications of our algorithm to feature combination: 1) fusing gray-level and LBP features for face recognition, and 2) combining multiple kernels for object categorization. Experimental results on challenging real-world datasets show that the feature combination capability of our proposed algorithm is competitive to the state-of-the-art multiple kernel learning methods.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4244-6985-7; POD:978-1-4244-6984-0","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539967","","Acceleration;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Gradient methods;Image reconstruction;Kernel;Linear regression;Machine learning;Optimization methods;Testing","face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;image representation;matrix algebra","face recognition;multiple kernel-based representations;multitask joint covariate selection model;multitask joint sparse representation;proximal gradient method;supervised visual recognition applications;visual classification","","127","","26","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
