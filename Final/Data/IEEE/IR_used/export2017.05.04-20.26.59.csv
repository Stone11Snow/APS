Temporal information plays an important role in the webpage retrieval. The webpage has both the temporal metadata and temporal semantics in the content. However, the existing search engines conduct the information retrieval based on text keywords rather than temporal semantics. To address this issue, a Temporal semantics Information Retrieval (TSIR) System is proposed to deal with the Chinese temporal information retrieval. The TSIR system is deployed on Hadoop and implemented by the means of MapReduce. Firstly, the Chinese temporal regular expression rule is introduced to extract the explicit and implicit temporal phrases in the query keywords and webpages. Secondly, the scores of webpages are re-evaluated by taking text relevance and temporal semantics relevance into account and the returned results are ranked according to re-evaluation. Experiment shows that TSIR system could precisely and effectively match the keywords queries related to temporal expression.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3776-9; POD:978-1-4799-3777-6; USB:978-1-4799-3775-2","10.1109/CSCWD.2014.6846852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846852","Chinese temporal semantics;Information retrieval;MapReduce;Temporal ranking","Data mining;Earthquakes;Educational institutions;Search engines;Semantics;Standards","Internet;information retrieval systems;meta data;natural language processing;parallel programming;public domain software;query processing;text analysis","Chinese temporal regular expression rule;Chinese temporal semantic information retrieval system;Hadoop;MapReduce;TSIR system;Web page retrieval;explicit temporal phrase extraction;implicit temporal phrase extraction;information consumption;information production;information retrieval research;query keywords;temporal metadata;temporal semantics relevance;text relevance","","0","","15","","","21-23 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Private information retrieval (PIR) aims to hide search histories from service providers by allowing a user to retrieve the wth record of a database without revealing w to the server. However, most known PIR schemes are either very inefficient (and therefore unlikely to gain traction in a practical sense) or reliant on some restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we consider an efficient class of schemes called multi-server PIR. Multi-server PIR assumes that the client communicates with multiple, non-colluding servers, each possessing an identical copy of the database. The current literature does not address the assumption that servers store perfectly-synchronized databases. This seems implausible, especially if servers are not meant to collude. We propose the first multiserver PIR scheme to return the desired record even when servers' databases are not perfectly synchronized. Our scheme asymptotically has the same computational and communication complexity as state-of-the-art PIR schemes for synchronized databases; this comes at the expense of probabilistic success guarantees and two rounds of communication. As a secondary result, our approach can efficiently process multiple concurrent queries in one round of PIR.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8009-3; POD:978-1-4799-8010-9; USB:978-1-4799-8008-6","10.1109/ALLERTON.2014.7028488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028488","","Decoding;Indexes;Polynomials;Servers;Synchronization;Vectors","communication complexity;data privacy;database management systems;information retrieval;synchronisation","PIR scheme;communication complexity;computational complexity;multiserver PIR;multiserver private information retrieval;noncolluding server;perfectly-synchronized database;search history;service provider;unsynchronized databases","","1","","24","","","Sept. 30 2014-Oct. 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multimedia is Big Data, not only in terms of their volume, but also with respect to their heterogeneous nature. This also includes the variety of the queries to be executed. Current approaches for searching in big multimedia collections mainly rely on keywords. However, manually annotating every single object in a large collection is not feasible. Therefore, content-based multimedia retrieval -using sample objects as query input - is increasingly becoming an important requirement for dealing with the data deluge. In image databases, for instance, effective methods exploit the use of exemplary images or hand-drawn sketches as query input. In this paper, we introduce ADAM, a novel multimedia retrieval system that is tailored to large collections and that is able to support both Boolean retrieval for structured data and similarity-based retrieval for feature vectors extracted from the multimedia objects. For efficient query processing in such big multimedia data, ADAM allows the distribution of the indexed collection to multiple shards and performs queries in a MapReduce style. Furthermore, it supports a signature-based indexing strategy for similarity search that heavily reduces the query time. The efficiency of ADAM has been successfully evaluated in a content-based image retrieval application on the basis of 14 million images from the ImageNet collection.","2379-7703;23797703","Electronic:978-1-4799-5057-7; POD:978-1-4799-5058-4","10.1109/BigData.Congress.2014.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906809","Big Multimedia;Boolean retrieval;databases;multimedia;similarity search","Data mining;Feature extraction;Multimedia communication;Multimedia databases;Vectors","Big Data;image retrieval;multimedia databases;visual databases","ADAM;Boolean retrieval;ImageNet collection;MapReduce;big multimedia collections;content-based image retrieval;database and information retrieval system;feature vectors;multimedia objects;multimedia retrieval system;query processing;query time reduction;signature-based indexing strategy;similarity search;similarity-based retrieval;structured data","","4","","18","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The high computational cost of similarity evaluation based on musical features between a pair of music clips is a crucial problem especially for searching large music database. To reduce the computational time in similarity evaluation process, the proposed method adopts an approach called indirect matching. In the approach, a small number of music clips called representative queries, which are randomly selected from a database, are used for fast computation. As an offline process, the similarities of each music clip in the database to the representative queries are recorded as a similarity table. In the online phase, the similarity between the actual query (the music clip given by a user) and each music clip in the database is quickly estimated by referring the similarity table. Experimental results have shown that the execution time of retrieval can be greatly reduced by the indirect matching without much deterioration of retrieval accuracy.","2219-5491;22195491","Electronic:978-0-9928-6261-9; POD:978-1-4799-4603-7; USB:978-0-9928-6262-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6952573","Music information retrieval;content-based retrieval;indirectmatching;similarity evaluation of music","Accuracy;Computational efficiency;Databases;Feature extraction;Music information retrieval;Silicon carbide;Vectors","content-based retrieval;music;pattern matching;query processing","computational time reduction;fast content-based music information retrieval method;high computational cost;indirect matching approach;music clip pair;music database;representative queries;similarity evaluation process;similarity table","","0","","11","","","1-5 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem the paper addresses specifically is the issue of large scale pattern recognition during the processes of information retrieval for e.g. in web search engines. The solution proposed is a novel genetic algorithm for the pattern recognition step, which utilizes the concepts of adaptive operator switching and the probability structure of the solution space. These two concepts have not been explored earlier within a single frame work by other researchers in the context of genetic algorithm for pattern recognition. The algorithm utilizes the probability structure of the solution space at every iteration to find better combinations of mutation and crossover operators. The operators are chosen from operator sets based on a mapping between the individual members of the sets and the probability distribution of the solutions. This mapping between the sets and distributions is changed as per the quality of the solutions at every iteration. This algorithm is highly scalable and is easily generalizable to strings, sets, sequences and graphs. This algorithm provides a significant improvement over some presently available optimization based algorithms for pattern recognition based information retrieval. The authors justify and validate the algorithm and its suitability through several theoretical arguments and inferences.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2397-7; POD:978-1-4799-2405-9","10.1109/ICCPCT.2014.7054823","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7054823","Pattern recognition;genetic algorithm;operator sets;probability structure","Algorithm design and analysis;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Pattern matching;Web search","Internet;genetic algorithms;graph theory;information retrieval;pattern recognition;search engines;set theory","Web search engines;adaptive operator set switching based genetic algorithm;crossover operator;graphs;information retrieval problems;mutation operator;pattern recognition step;probability structure utilization;sequences;solution space probability structure based genetic algorithm;strings","","0","","12","","","20-21 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automated recommendation systems are essential for users to discover music they love and for artists to reach appropriate audience. When manual annotations and user preference data is lacking (e.g. for new artists) these systems must rely on content based methods. Besides powerful machine learning tools for classification and retrieval, a key component for successful recommendation is the audio content representation. Good representations should capture informative musical patterns in the audio signal of songs. These representations should be concise, to enable efficient (low storage, easy indexing, fast search) management of huge music repositories, and should also be easy and fast to compute, to enable real-time interaction with a user supplying new songs to the system. Before designing new audio features, we explore the usage of traditional local features, while adding a stage of encoding with a pre-computed codebook and a stage of pooling to get compact vectorial representations. We experiment with different encoding methods, namely the LASSO, vector quantization (VQ) and cosine similarity (CS). We evaluate the representations' quality in two music information retrieval applications: query-by-tag and query-by-example. Our results show that concise representations can be used for successful performance in both applications. We recommend using top- τ VQ encoding, which consistently performs well in both applications, and requires much less computation time than the LASSO.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2014.2337842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6851913","Audio content representations;music information retrieval;music recommendation;sparse coding;vector quantization","Dictionaries;Encoding;Hidden Markov models;Speech;Speech processing;Training;Vectors","","","","10","","51","","20140710","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

According to the work in this paper, a new data structure called Dynamic Ordered Multi-field Index (DOMI) for information retrieval has been introduced. It is based on radix trees organized in segments in addition to a hash table to point to the roots of each segment, where each segment is dedicated to store the values of a single field. The hash table is used to access the needed segments directly without traversing the upper segments. So, DOMI improves look-up performance for queries addressing to a single field. In the case of multiple queries addressing, each segment of the radix tree is traversed sequentially without visiting the unrelated branches. The use of segmentation for the proposed DOMI provides flexibility for minimizing communication overhead in the distributed system. Every field in the radix tree is represented by one segment, where each segment can be stored as one block. Moreover, the proposed DOMI consumes less space comparing to indexes which are built using B or B+ trees. Hence, it is more suitable for intensive-data such as Big Data.","","CD-ROM:978-977-403-689-7; Electronic:978-977-403-695-8; POD:978-1-4799-4018-9","10.1109/INFOS.2014.7036684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036684","Big Data;Data query;Dynamic Order Multi-field Index (DOMI);Indexing structures","Computers;Data structures;Distributed computing;Educational institutions;Indexing;Informatics","data structures;indexing;query processing","Big Data;DOMI data structure;dynamic ordered multifield index;hash table;indexing structure;information retrieval;query addressing;radix tree","","0","","23","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IR systems have been widely used for the task of ranking documents accurately for a given keyword query from the vast collection. Typically, web search engines are required to satisfy diverse information needs of user i.e. different users may have different search intention when they submit the same query to a search engine. Since there is a huge amount of user data available, it becomes possible to build user model so as to identify the more relevant documents based on individual users interest. This paper focuses on such a model suitable for IR especially for web search. It requires very less effort from the user side. The proposed user modeling would be helpful when the keyword query issued by the user is short and ambiguous i.e. most of the users provide inaccurate keyword query which is imprecise and they often under-specify their exact information needs. Thus query becomes ambiguous which needs to be understood by the retrieval system. Hence, personalization strategy needs to be adopted in order to solve these problems faced by the retrieval system. In order to personalize web search, the user profile model is formulated by using users browsing history. In the same way, past queries and clicks made by the user can also be used for building user search model. This approach is implemented and tested using real time user data.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3506-2; POD:978-1-4799-3507-9","10.1109/ICACCS.2013.6938717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6938717","Information retrieval;personalization;probabilistic model;user modeling;web search","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;History;Probabilistic logic;Probability distribution;Search engines;Web search","Internet;query processing;search engines;statistical analysis","IR systems;Web search engines;Web search process;diverse information needs;information retrieval personalization;keyword query;made clicks;past queries;personalization strategy;retrieval system;search intention;statistical language modeling;user profile model;user search model","","1","","19","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To meet the different objectives varieties of sensors are designed. Sometimes the derived information from these specific sensors individually is not enough to meet the objective of current application. There is a need to improve the accuracy of the information with confidence over period of time. In such circumstances, fusion of two or more sensors' data improves the accuracy and confidence in information extraction. In this paper, we propose novel fusion approaches developed by exploring the benefits of the spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions of space borne sensors, and multi-modalities of bio sensors. Spatial-spectral fusion method is developed by using Fast Discrete Curvelet Transforms (FDCT). It improves the spatial resolution of a coarser multispectral image. Spatial-radiometric fusion method is developed by using Wavelet Transforms. It improves the radiometric resolution of the high spatial multispectral image. Spatial-temporal fusion method is developed through temporal high pass modulation. It improves the temporal resolution of the high spatial multispectral image. In medical imaging modalities, MRI has an advantage of high spatial resolution compared to the CT, PET, and SPECT imaging modalities. But each one of them has a specific advantage in diagnosing the disease. In this paper, we presented MRI-CT, MRI-PET and MRI-SPECT image fusion approaches by using Wavelet Transforms. Experimental results of MRI-CT image fusion demonstrated which can obtain the benefits of multi-modalities fusion in information retrieval. The tomographic sections of fused images are used for constructing 3D model to derive the complete information. Experimental results of these methods are discussed for the potential opportunities to improve accuracy and confidence in precise information retrieval.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6629-5; POD:978-1-4799-6630-1; USB:978-1-4799-6628-8","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019736","Accuracy and precision;Image Fusion;Information retrieval;Multi-Sensors Data","Computed tomography;Image fusion;Magnetic resonance imaging;Sensors;Spatial resolution;Transforms","biomedical MRI;curvelet transforms;discrete transforms;image fusion;information retrieval;medical image processing;positron emission tomography;single photon emission computed tomography;wavelet transforms","3D model;FDCT;MRI-CT image fusion;MRI-PET image fusion;MRI-SPECT image fusion;bio sensors;computed tomography;fast discrete curvelet transforms;fused image tomographic sections;information retrieval;magnetic resonance imaging;medical imaging modalities;multisensor data fusion;positron emission tomography;single photon emission tomography;space borne sensors;spatial multispectral image;spatial-radiometric fusion method;spatial-spectral fusion method;spatial-temporal fusion method;temporal high pass modulation;wavelet transforms","","0","","25","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, access to information requires the use of web tools for information retrieval (IR). Many methods from traditional IR were extended to structured documents. On the other hand, approaches have been proposed to regard specifically semantics in structured documents by using external semantic resources while collecting original documents on which it is necessary to provide semantic similarity measures in order to perform comparisons between concepts. Most previous approaches did not take into account the relations between concepts and are not tailored to the specific needs of learners. In this paper a semantic IR system of structured educational documents is proposed and adapted to the needs and preferences of the learner.

To support ITS services, architecture is required to retrieve information and data from moving vehicles and roadside facilities in an efficient manner. A two-tier system that integrates low-tier vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and a high-tier infrastructure-based peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay, which can achieve a high lookup success rate and low lookup latency for information retrieval, has been developed. However, conventional information lookups in the two-tier VANET/P2P system may introduce extra lookup messages and latencies because the lookup queries are simultaneously performed over the VANET/P2P networks. This paper proposes an adaptive lookup protocol for the two-tier VANET/P2P system to improve the efficiency of information retrieval. The proposed protocol uses a Bloom filter, which is a space-efficient data structure, to collect reachability information of road segments; therefore, adaptive routing of queries between low- and high-tier networks according to reachability probability can be employed. Simulations based on the SUMO traffic simulator and QualNet network simulator demonstrate that compared with the conventional two-tier lookup mechanism, the adaptive lookup protocol can reduce the lookup latency by 12%, reduce the P2P lookup overhead by 20%-33%, and achieve a high success rate in information lookups.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2014.2329015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826585","Information retrieval;intelligent transportation systems (ITS);peer-to-peer (P2P) computing;vehicular network","Information retrieval;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Roads;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Wireless communication","data structures;intelligent transportation systems;peer-to-peer computing;protocols;query processing;telecommunication network routing;vehicular ad hoc networks","Bloom filter;ITS services;P2P lookup overhead reduction;QualNet network simulator;SUMO traffic simulator;adaptive lookup protocol;adaptive query routing;data retrieval;efficiency improvement;high lookup success rate;high-tier infrastructure-based peer-to-peer overlay;information lookups;intelligent transportation system services;lookup latency reduction;low-tier vehicular ad hoc networks;moving vehicles;roadside facilities;space-efficient data structure;two-tier P2P information retrieval services;two-tier VANET information retrieval services","","4","","28","","20140605","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In Tamil documents, Morphology (separating noun and verb) concept is used to retrieve the text. In this paper we use new approach on text processing in the information retrieval system. So we can widen our search criteria namely, Vowel - Kuril (Short), Nedil (Long); Consonant - Vallinam (Hard), Mellinam (Soft) and Idaiyinam (Medium). So it would not wait for the entire word to enter; perhaps the searching process starts immediately after the first letter is entered, because the Database table is segregated into 5 components rather than a single Database table. So to minimise the time constraint, memory space and to do a smart search a new IR system is introduced. In the proposed system, searches can be divided into three categorise, namely (i) Main topic search (ii) Subtitle search and (iii) Keyword search. So the system would search quickly and retrieve required information only. In addition to that, every poem is displayed with related pictures. So users will show more interest and desire to read those poems. In the classical system, the user should give the exact word to retrieve the information. But in the proposed system the misspelled word could be corrected and the information can be retrieved, because internally the system has its own spell checker. This would be useful for Tamil literates, Tamil students, Tamil scholars, etc.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3834-6; POD:978-1-4799-3698-4","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033837","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033837","Information Retrieval;Tamil Language;Text processing;Vector Space Model","Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Indexing;Information retrieval;Text processing;Vectors","database management systems;information retrieval systems;natural language processing;text analysis;vectors;word processing","IR system;database table;information retrieval system;tamil language;text processing;vector space model","","1","","16","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It also uses an n-ary tree data structure which is a hierarchy of keywords which is used to map in case of inexact match. As a proof of concept, a small application is built for a project manager to organize and retrieve resources efficiently.

Research in intention recognition has also progressed substantially, yet very little has been done to recognize query intents to search, select, map and extract responses from such enormous pools of candidate databases. Query mapping becomes truly complicated particularly in scientific databases where tools and functions are needed to interpret the database contents, semantics of which are usually hidden inside the functions. In this paper, we present a declarative meta-language, called BioVis, using which biologists potentially are able to express their “intentional queries” with the expectation that a mapping function μ is able to accurately understand the meaning of the queries and map them to the underlying resources appropriately. We show that such a function is technically feasible if we can design a schema mapping function that can tailor itself according to a knowledgebase and recognize entities in schema graphs. We offer this idea as a possible research problem for the community to address.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3481-2; POD:978-1-4799-3482-9","10.1109/ICDEW.2014.6818304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6818304","","Abstracts;Data integration;Databases;Organisms;Proteins;Semantics;Vegetation","Big Data;database management systems;human factors;query processing","Big data Web resources;BioVis;Web services;XML;abstract query mapping;big databases;candidate databases;cloud computing;declarative meta-language;information extraction;information retrieval;intentional queries;mapping function;on-the-fly data integration;query intention recognition;schema graphs;scientific databases","","0","","22","","","March 31 2014-April 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to identify, understand, and characterize such structural differences, we build a framework using point set topology to analyze document-query sets. Our framework tailors topological notions such as subbasis, cover, compactness, towards IR. Unlike previous topological approaches, we use the reverse of the relevance map to topologize the set of queries, not the set of documents. We show that the topological approach exposes sharp differences between enterprise and web-collected standard research document-query sets.

On the other hand, text recognition has been thoroughly studied for a long time, especially for vision-based intelligent transportation systems. However, LED text recognition still remains a challenge due to its different types and consisting of discontinuous character. Therefore, this work addresses a method to recognized LED text contained on electronic road sign, as an application to intelligent transportation systems (ITS).Our proposed method extracts supporting points representing as a center of LED segment on binary map of the input image. Character region generating is applied using density-based spatial region generation (DBSREN) method. The spatial information of each point contained on region is utilized for acquiring region feature. Nearest Cluster Neighbor (NCN) classifier is then used for training as well as recognizing stage. In experiment, our method achieves 87.4% and 61% of detection and recognition rate, respectively. The processing time is almost 12 frames per second.

In his chapter on Information, Language, and Society, he points out the “well-known tendency of libraries to become clogged by their own volume” and notes the limitations of classification schemes, largely because of the problem of integrating new subject matter into a predetermined classification code. This paper introduces a self-organizing system that builds on Norbert Wiener's thoughts. It addresses the problem of information overload we are all currently experiencing in “big data” environments. Analyses of command information flows during military crises have suggested an approach to ontogenetic learning that avoids both the problem of describing the subject covered in a document and the problem of integrating new subject matter into a predetermined classification code. “Reference-connected sets” are constructed from message traffic dealing with a crisis and have been found to uniquely identify operational events during the crisis. Such sets (and subsets if further refinement is desired} can be obtained in real-time and a method is demonstrated that automatically classifies messages as they enter the system. The system thus focuses on the evolution of subjects as represented by referenced documents upon which any “new” information is based, in a manner similar to Norbert Wiener's “emergent behavior”. The paper then develops measures of effectiveness and shows how reference-connected sets can be used in filtering and organizing information in both hierarchical and non-hierarchical organizations across local, national, and international boundaries.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4562-7; POD:978-1-4799-4561-0","10.1109/NORBERT.2014.6893902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6893902","behavior;communication;control;emergence;reference-connecting;sets","Cybernetics;Data visualization;Information filters;Libraries;Organizations","Big Data;classification;cybernetics;information filtering;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);military computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);self-organising feature maps","Big Data environments;Norbert Wiener's emergent behavior;automatic information classification;automatic information retrieval;automatic message classification;command information flow;cybernetics;information filtering;information overload;international boundaries;local boundaries;message traffic;military crises;national boundaries;ontogenetic learning;operational events;predetermined classification code;reference-connected sets;self-organizing system","","0","","7","","","24-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Utilizing distinct terms for proximity and phrases in the document for better information retrieval","M. I. Rafique; M.

Users want their queries to be more relevant to the documents. For this purpose, the idea of proximity is utilized where close query terms in the document show high proximity and hence the document is likely to be more relevant. But almost every retrieval function (e.g., BM25) uses bag-of-words technique, thus ignoring the importance of proximity. In this paper, we find such short sentences (sub-sentences) or group of words that are made by distinct words or terms on their first occurrence in the documents to calculate the proximity and subsequently incorporate it into a retrieval function to improve the ranking of the documents. We have shown that there are significant numbers of short sentences formed by distinct words that can be used to exploit proximity and phrase search. Furthermore, turning the non-positional (record level) inverted index into partial-positional inverted index by utilizing distinct terms (UDT), the UDT partial-positional inverted index has been separated from the full positional (word level) inverted index to calculate proximity among the distinct terms efficiently. As calculating proximity with full positional inverted index is complex and computationally expensive, the proximity with the UDT partial-positional inverted index can be computed easily and efficiently. Experiments on various data sets have shown that the proposed approach has improved the precision of the documents.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6089-7; POD:978-1-4799-6090-3","10.1109/ICET.2014.7021024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7021024","Inverted Index;Phrase Search;Proximity","Computer science;Dictionaries;Educational institutions;Indexes;Query processing;Standards","document handling;indexing;query processing","UDT partial-positional inverted index;bag-of-words technique;document phrase;document proximity;document ranking;full positional inverted index;information retrieval;query terms;utilizing distinct terms","","0","","22","","","8-9 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unsupervised feature learning techniques, such as sparse coding and deep belief networks have been utilized to represent music information as a term-document structure comprising of elementary audio codewords. Despite the widespread use of such bag-of-frames (BoF) model, few attempts have been made to systematically compare different component settings. Moreover, whether techniques developed in the text retrieval community are applicable to audio codewords is poorly understood. To further our understanding of the BoF model, we present in this paper a comprehensive evaluation that compares a large number of BoF variants on three different MIR tasks, by considering different ways of low-level feature representation, codebook construction, codeword assignment, segment-level and song-level feature pooling, tf-idf term weighting, power normalization, and dimension reduction. Our evaluations lead to the following findings: 1) modeling music information by two levels of abstraction improves the result for difficult tasks such as predominant instrument recognition, 2) tf-idf weighting and power normalization improve system performance in general, 3) topic modeling methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation does not work for audio codewords.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2014.2311016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6763025","Bag-of-frames model;music information retrieval;sparse coding;unsupervised feature learning","Frequency measurement;Matching pursuit algorithms;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Spectrogram;Training","information retrieval;music;unsupervised learning","BoF model;MIR;audio codewords;bag-of-frames representation;feature representations;music information modeling;music information retrieval problems;power normalization;tf-idf weighting;unsupervised feature learning","","18","","64","","20140311","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It then has a large volume of information, but without mastery of content. In this immense data warehouse research of current information retrieval systems do not allow users to obtain results to their requests that meet exactly their needs. This is due in large part to indexing techniques (key words, thesaurus). The result is that the user of the web wasting much of his time to examine a large number of Web page by searching for what he needs, because the Web does not provide service in this direction. The Semantic Web is the solution; this new vision of the web is to make web resources not only understandable by humans but also by machines. To improve the relevance of information retrieval, we propose in this paper an approach based on the use of domain ontology for indexing a collection of documents and the use of semantic links between documents in the collection to allow the inference of all relevant documents. The work involves the implementation of a system based on the use of OWL ontology for research pedagogical documents. In this case, the descriptors are not directly chosen in the documents but in the ontology and are indexed by concepts that reflect their meaning rather than words are often ambiguous. To perform a search based on meaning, documents and their descriptors are stored in OWL ontologies describing the documentary features of a document. The objective is to design two types of OWL ontologies: document ontology reserved for storage of all pedagogical documents and domain ontology reserved for well-structured of documents stored in the level of the document ontology and each document is indexed by its keywords and their synonyms.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3823-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-3824-7; POD:978-1-4799-3825-4","10.1109/ICMCS.2014.6911361","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6911361","Information retrieval;Pedagogical document;indexation;ontology;sematic web","Boolean functions;Data structures;Indexing;OWL;Ontologies;Search problems;Thesauri","document handling;indexing;information retrieval;knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;thesauri","OWL ontologies;Web resources;data warehouse research;descriptors;document ontology;documentary features;domain ontology;indexing techniques;information retrieval system based ontology;research pedagogical documents;semantic Web;thesaurus","","0","","16","","","14-16 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It offers two layers of protection. First, robust hash values are used as queries to prevent revealing original content or features. Second, the client can choose to omit certain bits in a hash value to further increase the ambiguity for the server. Due to the reduced information, it is computationally difficult for the server to know the client's interest. The server has to return the hash values of all possible candidates to the client. The client performs a search within the candidate list to find the best match. Since only hash values are exchanged between the client and the server, the privacy of both parties is protected. We introduce the concept oftunable privacy, where the privacy protection level can be adjusted according to a policy. It is realized through hash-based piecewise inverted indexing. The idea is to divide a feature vector into pieces and index each piece with a subhash value. Each subhash value is associated with an inverted index list. The framework has been extensively tested using a large image database. We have evaluated both retrieval performance and privacy-preserving performance for a particular content identification application. Two different constructions of robust hash algorithms are used. One is based on random projections; the other is based on the discrete wavelet transform. Both algorithms exhibit satisfactory performance in comparison with state-of-the-art retrieval schemes. The results show that the privacy enhancement slightly improves the retrieval performance. We consider the majority voting attack for estimating the query category and identification. Experiment results show that this attack is a threat when there are near-duplicates, but the success rate decreases with the number of omitted bits and the number of distinct items.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2365998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940262","Multimedia database;content-based retrieval;data privacy;image hashing;indexing;multimedia database","Data privacy;Indexes;Multimedia communication;Privacy;Robustness;Servers","client-server systems;content-based retrieval;data privacy;discrete wavelet transforms;indexing;visual databases","concept oftunable privacy;content identification application;discrete wavelet transform;feature hash-based;hash algorithms;hash-based piecewise inverted indexing;inverted index list;large image database;large-scale content-based information retrieval;privacy protection level;privacy-preserving framework;privacy-preserving performance;query category;random projection;subhash value","","9","","59","","20141030","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Document centroid normalization helps to achieve more effective information retrieval as it enables good discrimination between documents. In the context of a machine learning application, namely unsupervised document indexing and retrieval, we compared the effectiveness of the proposed weighting scheme to the `Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency' or TF-IDF, which is commonly used and considered as one of the best existing weighting schemes. The paper shows how the document centroid is used to remove less significant weights from documents and how this helps to achieve better retrieval effectiveness. Most of the existing weighting schemes in information retrieval research assume that the whole document collection is static. The results presented in this paper show that the proposed weighting scheme can produce higher retrieval effectiveness compared with the TF-IDF weighting scheme, in both static and dynamic document collections. The results also show the variation in information retrieval effectiveness that is achieved for static and dynamic document collections by using a specific weighting scheme.

The literature on PIR considers only replication-based systems, wherein each storage node stores a copy of the entire data. However, systems based on erasure codes are gaining increasing popularity due to a variety of reasons. This paper initiates an investigation into PIR in erasure-coded systems by establishing its capacity and designing explicit codes and algorithms. The notion of privacy considered here is information-theoretic, and the metric optimized is the amount of data downloaded by the user during PIR. In this paper, we present four main results. First, we design an explicit erasure code and PIR algorithm that requires only one extra bit of download to provide perfect privacy. In contrast, all existing PIR algorithms require a download of at least twice the size of the requisite data. Second, we derive lower bounds proving the necessity of downloading at least one additional bit. This establishes the precise capacity of PIR with respect to the metric of download. These results are also applicable to PIR in replication-based systems, which are a special case of erasure codes. Our third contribution is a negative result showing that capacity-achieving codes necessitate super-linear storage overheads. This motivates the fourth contribution of this paper: an erasure code and PIR algorithm that requires a linear storage overhead, provides high reliability to the data, and is a small factor away from the capacity.","2157-8095;21578095","Electronic:978-1-4799-5186-4; POD:978-1-4799-5187-1; USB:978-1-4799-5185-7","10.1109/ISIT.2014.6874954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6874954","","Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Encoding;Information retrieval;Measurement;Reliability;Vectors","codes;data privacy;information retrieval systems;storage management","PIR algorithms;PIR systems;download metric;erasure codes;erasure-coded systems;information-theoretic notion;linear storage overhead;lower bounds;perfect privacy;privacy notion;private information retrieval;public database;replication-based systems;storage node","","6","","15","","","June 29 2014-July 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this implies an expensive computation or communication cost of all the data on the server. Existing solutions are not efficient due to their impractical communication and computation cost. Besides, most of them do not support keyword search. In this paper, we introduce the mechanism of pricing to solve the problem of impractical cost. Using our scheme called KSPIR, we achieve the minimum communication and computation cost according to the flexible privacy and budget specified by users. It is indeed a kind of tradeoff between the cost of retrieval and the degree of privacy. It is worth noting that it also supports keyword search.

We show that how this representation model can reduce the size of an inverted index as well as the time to build it.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3062-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-3064-7; POD:978-1-4799-3065-4","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056941","Free text quires;Inverted index;term weight","Indexes;Optimized production technology;Payloads;Standards;Uniform resource locators","document handling;information retrieval;information storage;trees (mathematics)","content sharing;document collection system;document representation model;information retrieval system;information storage;inverted index;tree representation","","0","","26","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The great challenge of the information retrieval system is to retrieve the related relevant information from the heterogeneous web resources. This paper aims for the retrieval of the relevant geo-spatial concepts from the geo-spatial ontology which aids application in quality testing of water and flood prediction. In the geo-spatial concept space, the retrieval of relevant geo-spatial concepts depends on the distance separating the two geo-spatial concepts and the context of the concepts. Research in geo-spatial information retrieval has used either the semantic distance between the geo-spatial concepts or the context of the concepts for computing the relevancy. This paper proposes HCC (Hybrid Conceptual Context) algorithm which aims at retrieving relevant geo-spatial concepts by considering both the semantic distance and the context on which the concepts occur in the geo-spatial space. This work computes the semantic similarity by measuring the semantic distance using Euclidean and Manhattan distance measure. This computation is carried out in two steps such as retrieval of semantically similar geo-spatial concepts and the retrieval of context dependent geo-spatial concepts. Semantic similarity computation in HCC algorithm retrieves contextually and semantically similar relevant geo-spatial concepts using Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance measures. Experiments have been done using Ordnance Survey Master Map datasource and geo-spatial ontology. The precision and recall show Manhattan based semantic similarity computation improves relevancy by 10%.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1024-3; POD:978-1-4799-1023-6","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844175","Distance Measures;Geographical Features;Hybrid Model;Semantic Description;Semantic Similarity;Spatial Relations","Computational modeling;Context;Equations;Euclidean distance;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;Semantics","geophysics computing;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","Euclidean distance measure;HCC algorithm;Manhattan distance measure;Ordnance Survey Master Map datasource;concepts context;context dependent geo-spatial concept retrieval;flood prediction;geo-spatial ontology;geospatial information retrieval;hybrid conceptual context algorithm;hybrid semantic similarity distance measures;semantic distance;semantic similarity computation;semantically similar geo-spatial concept retrieval;water quality testing","","0","","17","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) computations are done on input data streams to produce reduced rank matrix approximation and orthogonal transformations. With this reduced matrix we got promising results in terms of computation time when GA is applied for IR. Experiments were performed on sample dataset of 2500 input documents and weighted vectors are generated.

In this paper we present pCloud, a distributed system that constitutes the first attempt towards practical cPIR. Our approach assumes a disk-based architecture that retrieves one page with a single query. Using a striping technique, we distribute the database to a number of cooperative peers, and leverage their computational resources to process cPIR queries in parallel. We implemented pCloud on the PlanetLab network, and experimented extensively with several system parameters. Our results indicate that pCloud reduces considerably the query response time compared to the traditional client/server model, and has a very low communication overhead.

To address this problem, information retrieval (IR) based bug localization has increasingly been used to suggest potential buggy files given a bug report. To date, researchers have proposed a number of IR techniques for bug localization and empirically evaluated them to understand their effectiveness. However, virtually all of the evaluations have been limited to the projects written in object-oriented programming languages, particularly Java. Therefore, the effectiveness of these techniques for other widely used languages such as C is still unknown. In this paper, we create a benchmark dataset consisting of more than 7,500 bug reports from five popular C projects and rigorously evaluate our recently introduced IR-based bug localization tool using this dataset. Our results indicate that although the IR-relevant properties of C and Java programs are different, IR-based bug localization in C software at the file level is overall as effective as in Java software. However, we also find that the recent advance of using program structure information in performing bug localization gives less of a benefit for C software than for Java software.","1063-6773;10636773","Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4","10.1109/ICSME.2014.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976082","Bug Localization;Information Retrieval;Search","Accuracy;Java;Kernel;Linux;Measurement","C language;Java;information retrieval;object-oriented programming;program debugging","C programs;Java programs;bug localization;buggy files;information retrieval;object-oriented programming languages;software projects","","2","","22","","","Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the existing model they did not take the context into consideration so the information cannot be retrieved efficiently. In this paper, we propose a context-sensitive document indexing approach for information retrieval. The content carrying terms and background terms are separated by using lexical association. Indexing weight is calculated for content carrying terms. The term having the highest indexing weight is considered as the most salient sentence and these sentences are extracted and the document summarization is done. Then according to the user query the information is retrieved, the query is considered as the keyword. Then this keyword is matched with the summarized document. Once the keyword is matched, the particular sentences were extracted by using indexing algorithm. Finally these sentences are provided as the responses for the user. By using this approach, the information retrieval can be done effectively.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3356-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-3358-7; POD:978-1-4799-3359-4","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6949870","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949870","Content carrying term and background term;indexing approach;keyword matching;sentences splitting","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Clustering algorithms;Context;Gases;Heating;Indexing","indexing;information retrieval","background terms;content carrying terms;context sensitive document indexing;document summarization;indexing weight;information retrieval;lexical association;user query","","0","","9","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nowadays many researchers and users work on Open Source Software to enhance its functionalities and to mould it according to their needs. Most of the time, a user or developer wants to locate a specific feature in software for the purpose of enhancement or removing a fault, which is known as concept localization. Automatic concept localization gives relevant files to the users as per the requirement. We have implemented n-gram, an Information Retrieval model to retrieve the names of the relevant files from the source code and incorporated Control Flow Graph (CFG) which helped us to determine the files encapsulating the functionality, in the correct order.

The number of published scientific studies has grown, increasing effort in carrying out this review. In this paper, we proposed two strategies to rank studies in decreasing order of importance, for a SLR, regarding the terms in the search string. These strategies are based on the Information Retrieval technique Vector Model. We implemented those strategies and conducted a case study to evaluate their applicability.

Relevance Feedback (RF) is an effective technique for improving IR and it consists of gathering further data representing the user's information need and automatically creating a new query. As RF relies on the ability of an IR system to learn new queries and is mostly based on statistical methods, a parallel between RF and statistical Machine Learning (ML) can be drawn. However, the effectiveness of RF is due to the biased selection of the sample data, thus contradicting the requirement that effective statistical learning is based on unbiased sample data. This paper studies this contradiction and suggests that RF cannot be straightforwardly studied within statistical ML without considering the intrinsic nature of the data managed by an IR system and of the user's information need. In particular, the paper reports that an RF algorithm is mostly influenced by the distance between the informative content of the training set and the informative content of the test set and is not influenced by sample selection bias.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6991-3; POD:978-1-4799-6982-1","10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058056","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Machine learning algorithms;Probability distribution;Radio frequency;Training;Vectors","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","IR system;ML;RF algorithm;information retrieval;informative content;relevance feedback algorithm;sample selection bias;statistical machine learning;training set;vector space model","","0","","11","","","Oct. 30 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Often the sheer quantities of data that is stored or archived in repositories or digital libraries make it difficult to navigate data; information in the data is obscured, particularly where we have Big Data. Traditionally, we record metadata on our data items to assist data classification and some information retrieval. The Semantic Web enables us to further unlock and enrich our data, by exploring how different data are related or connected. Using ontologies and Linked Data we can declare, navigate and discover semantic relationships. Relationships exist both locally, within the data, and globally, such that we can enhance our data with information retrieved from a wider context. To illustrate how the application of Semantic Web technologies aids data discovery and information retrieval, I discuss two case studies: (1) Sharing Ancient Wisdoms (SAWS), a Dynamic Library of information on selected ancient wisdom literature; and (2) the DEFRA DTC archive, a repository of data about freshwater quality in the UK.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-5531-2; Electronic:978-1-4799-5532-9; POD:978-1-4799-5533-6","10.1109/ETTLIS.2015.7048181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7048181","data repositories;digital libraries;information retrieval and discovery;linked data;ontologies;semantic web","Libraries;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantics;Surface acoustic waves;Vocabulary","Big Data;data mining;information resources;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;semantic Web","Big Data;DEFRA DTC archive;Linked Data;SAWS;data classification;data discovery;digital libraries;dynamic library;freshwater quality;information resource discovery;information retrieval;ontologies;semantic Web;semantic relationships;sharing ancient wisdoms","","0","","22","","","6-8 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides sophisticated chemical and physical methods for a direct material analysis, an indirect method based on information retrieval provides a less costly and more efficient alternative. During the process of information retrieval, PCBs and their components need to be recognized based on their appearance and the corresponding text information. Their material composition is then available through a pre-established database. Therefore, a practical text recognition is necessary for a successful data analysis prior to PCB recycling. Our paper is focusing on two key aspects of text recognition: binarization and final recognition of text objects using optical character recognition (OCR) engines. For binarization of text contents, a novel local thresholding method using an adaptive window size along with background estimation is presented. Several state-of-the-art algorithms and the proposed method were evaluated for comparing their binarization performance on text objects in PCB images. With respect to a data set containing manually created references, our novel method provides superior results. Furthermore, in contrast to previous work on text recognition, an additional evaluation of available open source OCR engines was conducted to asses technical limitations of OCR applications. We show that the quality of text recognition can be significantly improved if the binarization approach accounts for these technical limitations of OCR software. The presented method and results are expected to provide improved OCR performance also in other applications.","1553-572X;1553572X","Electronic:978-1-4799-4032-5; POD:978-1-4799-4031-8; USB:978-1-4799-4033-2","10.1109/IECON.2014.7049016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7049016","","Engines;Estimation;Image color analysis;Materials;Optical character recognition software;Recycling;Text recognition","electronic engineering computing;image retrieval;image segmentation;information retrieval;optical character recognition;printed circuit design","OCR engine;PCB recycling;adaptive window size;background estimation;binarization approach;environment-friendly recycling;image retrieval;information retrieval;local thresholding method;optical character recognition;printed circuit board;text recognition","","3","","26","","","Oct. 29 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides, the bag-of-words representation does not detect the differences of context in ambiguous terms, what reduces precision in search results. The objective of our research is to evaluate the applicability of the bag-of-concepts paradigm to information retrieval of educational resources. We built an information retrieval system that follows that approach and evaluated it with final users. The main contribution of this paper is the description of the architecture of the information retrieval system. First evaluation results show that the information retrieval system based on bag-of-concepts works well for retrieving educational resources.

A 10.5% relative gain in mean average precision (MAP) is obtained after fusing the k-means and DLVQ results together.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4799-2893-4; POD:978-1-4799-2894-1; USB:978-1-4799-2892-7","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853817","Deep neural network;information retrieval;k-means;learning vector quantization","Acoustics;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Speech;Training;Vector quantization;Vectors","acoustic signal processing;audio signal processing;information retrieval;neural nets;vector quantisation","DLVQ algorithm;DNN;acoustic information retrieval;audio information retrieval task;code-constrained codebook;deep learning vector quantization;deep neural network;k-means VQ technique;mean average precision","","2","","28","","","4-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
