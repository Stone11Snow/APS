To improve the effectiveness of similarity search we propose an extension to the well-known edit distance that we call the extended edit distance.

In this paper, we present a privacy-aware information brokerage framework called MUPPET that incorporates three novel techniques to give users control over the release of their data. First, it introduces operation-focused access control, a purpose-based access control model that supports flexible and fine-grain policies using typed operation labels. Second, MUPPET includes a purpose detector that has a number of techniques to detect the active purpose in a pervasive environment. Third, our system allows reward-driven information exchange, a protocol for explicit communication and negotiation of justifications and rewards supporting tunable privacy policies based on ongoing evaluation of the information exchange.

In this paper, we propose domain-based recommendation and retrieval of relevant materials in e- learning. Since relevancy is often domain dependent. Materials that are highly related in one domain might be irrelevant in another domain, we group users by their domains. Based on the content, multiple sets of relevant documents, one for each chosen domain, are prepared. In a search scenario, search sites are selected by domain and search is performed on the chosen relevant sites only. To demonstrate our idea, we use Virtual Conference on Genomic and Bioinformatics as the test bed and develop a presentation video access platform. The implementation involves techniques in image and video processing, database management, programming, and multimedia learning materials presentation.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3317-9","10.1109/IWSCA.2008.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4573160","Relevant document extraction;e-learning;multimedia","Biological materials;Biology;Computational modeling;Computer science;Electronic learning;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Recommender systems;Videoconference","computer aided instruction;information filters;information retrieval","domain-based recommendation;e-learning;relevant learning material retrieval","","1","","15","","","10-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

User queries are matched against the image annotations using the Cosine Similarity Measure, and the best matching images are displayed. To enable browsing of the image collection, the images are clustered according to time and location, the two main factors of episodic memory. User studies were conducted to compare the two annotation systems with time and location clustering alone, using searching time, recall and precision, and user satisfaction as criteria for success.

In this paper, the concept of group testing is generalized to applications with correlated source models to derive scheduling policies for sensors' adopting cooperative transmissions. The tenet of our work is that in a wireless sensor network it is advantageous to allocate the same channel dimensions to all sensor sources that have the same response to a sequence of queries or tests. That is, nodes that have the same data attributes should transmit as a cooperative super-source. Specifically, we consider the case where sensors' data are modeled spatially as a one-dimensional Markov chain. Two strategies are considered: the recursive algorithm and the tree-based algorithm. The recursive scheme allows us to illustrate the performance of group testing for finite populations while the tree-based algorithm is used to derive the achievable scaling performances of the class of group testing strategies as the number of sensors increases. We show that the total number of queries required to gather all sensors' data scales in the order of the joint entropy. A further generalization of this concept provides the basis of deriving efficient data-gathering algorithms for correlated sources.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2008.926363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567578","Cooperative communications;data gathering in sensor networks;distributed source coding;group testing;multiple access","Application software;Blood;Entropy;Information retrieval;Performance evaluation;Performance gain;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Source coding;Testing;Wireless sensor networks","Markov processes;channel allocation;entropy;group theory;queueing theory;recursive estimation;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","binary Markov sources;channel dimension allocation;cooperative sensor networks;data-driven group queries;data-gathering algorithms;group testing;joint entropy;queries sequence;recursive algorithm;scheduling policy;tree-based algorithm;wireless sensor network","","0","","47","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The use of multibiometrics is considered one of the keys to overcome the weakness and improve the accuracy of biometrics systems.

A major focus of this effort has been on the understanding of human activity as input to enable the design and implementation of context-aware applications. Context-awareness is a vital enabling technology for ubiquitous virtual reality applications. However, it is only recently that we have developed both the ability to sense human activity and model it for appropriate use in these applications. Now that we can build interesting and useful applications, one of the challenges is in making the leap from modeled human behavior to inferring human intent in context aware applications. With the expectation that many applications will make incorrect inferences, I argue that what is needed is a focus on intelligibility, or an understanding of why an application is behaving in a particular way. We also need to focus on making these applications usable by end-users. I will describe my grouppsilas work in sensing and modeling human activity in a variety of domains including office work, driving, and health.

"Localized asynchronous packet scheduling for buffered crossbar switches","D. Pan; Y. Yang","Dept. of Comput. Sci., State Univ. of New York, Stony Brook, NY","2006 Symposium on Architecture For Networking And Communications Systems","20080725","2006","","","153","162","In such a switch, besides normal input queues and output queues, a small buffer is associated with each crosspoint. Due to the introduction of crosspoint buffers, output and input contention is eliminated, and the scheduling process for buffered crossbar switches is greatly simplified. Moreover, crosspoint buffers enable the switch to work in an asynchronous mode and easily schedule and transmit variable length packets. Compared with fixed length packet scheduling or cell scheduling, variable length packet scheduling, or packet scheduling for short, has some unique advantages: higher throughput, shorter packet latency and lower hardware cost. In this paper, we present a fast and practical scheduling scheme for buffered crossbar switches called Localized Asynchronous Packet Scheduling (LAPS). With LAPS, an input port or output port makes scheduling decisions solely based on the state information of its local crosspoint buffers, i.e., the crosspoint buffers where the input port sends packets to or the output port retrieves packets from. The localization property makes LAPS suitable for a distributed implementation and thus highly scalable. Since no comparison operation is required in LAPS, scheduling arbiters can be efficiently implemented using priority encoders, which can make arbitration decisions quickly in hardware. Another advantage of LAPS is that each crosspoint needs only L (the maximum packet length) buffer space, which minimizes the hardware cost of the switches. We also theoretically analyze the performance of LAPS, and in particular we prove that LAPS achieves 100% throughput for any admissible traffic with speedup of two. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the analytical results and measure the performance of LAPS.","","POD:1-59593-580-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579533","100% throughput;buffered crossbar switches;packet scheduling;priority encoders","Costs;Delay;Hardware;Information retrieval;Packet switching;Performance analysis;Scheduling algorithm;Switches;Throughput;Traffic control","packet switching;queueing theory;scheduling","buffered crossbar switches;cell scheduling;fixed length packet scheduling;input queues;localized asynchronous packet scheduling;output queues;priority encoders;scheduling process","","0","","29","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, let us mention the entropy and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Accurate estimation of these measures requires to adapt to the local sample density, especially if the data are high-dimensional. The k nearest neighbor (kNN) framework has been used to define efficient variable-bandwidth kernel-based estimators with such a locally adaptive property. Unfortunately, these estimators are computationally intensive since they rely on searching neighbors among large sets of d-dimensional vectors. This computational burden can be reduced by pre-structuring the data, e.g. using binary trees as proposed by the approximated nearest neighbor (ANN) library. Yet, the recent opening of graphics processing units (GPU) to general-purpose computation by means of the NVIDIA CUDA API offers the image and video processing community a powerful platform with parallel calculation capabilities. In this paper, we propose a CUDA implementation of the ldquobrute forcerdquo kNN search and we compare its performances to several CPU-based implementations including an equivalent brute force algorithm and ANN. We show a speed increase on synthetic and real data by up to one or two orders of magnitude depending on the data, with a quasi-linear behavior with respect to the data size in a given, practical range.","2160-7508;21607508","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2340-8; POD:978-1-4244-2339-2","10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4563100","","Binary trees;Concurrent computing;Density measurement;Entropy;Graphics;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Information theory;Libraries;Nearest neighbor searches","computer graphics;image retrieval;search problems;statistical analysis;video signal processing","GPU;Kullback-Leibler divergence;NVIDIA CUDA API;approximated nearest neighbor library;brute force algorithm;efficient variable-bandwidth kernel-based estimators;fast k nearest neighbor search;graphics processing units;image processing;image retrieval;information theory;quasi-linear behavior;statistical measures;video object tracking;video processing","","114","","9","","","23-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to build a similarity music melody model, several audio files, whose melody is perceptually similar, are collected in our experiment. Many features are extracted and a melodic similarity model is defined through analyzing each feature and combinations of them. The melody model is evaluated based on classification results of six categories of Chinese folk music using Support Vector Machine. The experiment results show that 36-dimensional Constant Q Transform (CQT) feature can represent the melody of audio music pieces accurately. Further more, the classification results for audio data with similar melody are good enough to be used in audio music classification or segmentation and subsequently are very helpful in music information retrieval system.","","POD:978-0-7695-3119-9","10.1109/CISP.2008.554","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4566790","Constant Q Transform (CQT);Perception Analysis;Pitch Class Profile (PCP);Similarity Matrix","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Digital audio players;Human voice;Instruments;Internet;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","","","","0","","13","","","27-30 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present advances in a method to retrieve the total water vapor (TWV) of the polar atmosphere from data from spaceborne microwave radiometers such as the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit B (AMSU-B) on the polar-orbiting satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NOAA-15, -16, and -17. The starting point of the retrieval is a recently proposed algorithm that uses the three AMSU-B channels centered around the 183-GHz water vapor line and the window channel at 150 GHz, and that can retrieve the TWV with little dependence on the surface emissivity. This works up to TWV values of about 7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. We extend the retrievable range toward higher TWV values by including the window channel at 89 GHz. However, now, the algorithm needs information on the surface emissivity, which we have extracted from emissivity measurements over sea ice and open water during the Surface Emissivities in Polar Regions-Polar Experiment campaign. The resulting algorithm can retrieve TWV up to about 15 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with reduced accuracy as compared to the original algorithm. It now allows the monitoring of the TWV over the central Arctic sea ice and over Antarctica, and the surrounding sea ice during most of the year with a spatial resolution of about 50 km. Such TWV fields can show details which might be missed out by standard weather model analysis data.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.918013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4578828","Microwave radiometry;polar regions;water vapor","Atmosphere;Data mining;Ice surface;Information retrieval;Microwave radiometry;Microwave theory and techniques;Satellite broadcasting;Sea ice;Sea measurements;Sea surface","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric radiation;atmospheric techniques;oceanographic regions;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice;water","AMSU-B microwave radiometer data;Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit B;Antarctica;H<sub>2</sub>O;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;central Arctic sea ice;frequency 150 GHz;frequency 183 GHz;frequency 89 GHz;polar atmosphere;polar regions;spaceborne microwave radiometry;surface emissivity;total water vapor;weather model analysis","","15","","40","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the key issues is how to construct effective organization and index to enhance image retrieval speed. Clustering is a kind of effective method. This paper presents a modified fuzzy C-means (MFCM) clustering index algorithm. In addition, in order to reduce the time of clustering, high-dimension feature space is transformed into lower-dimension space by using Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) transformation. The clustering step is performed in lower-dimension space, and image retrieval is only performed in clustered prototypes.

In spite of attention and success, however, there is still a lack of fundamental analysis and understanding of the elementary properties of these systems. In this paper we consider a class of P2P protocols suitable both for content delivery (file-based communications) and for high-bandwidth media streaming like video and TV, and explore its fundamental properties. The class considered is known as mesh-based swarming push-pull systems or interleave protocols. They split the content in pieces and alternate continuously two phases: One where the peer pushes a piece to another peer to percolate information in the system, and the other when it pulls a piece trying to retrieve missing information. We compare synchronous and asynchronous models and explore the impact of protocols parameters, such as the dimension of the active neighborhood, trying to identify the efficiency of these very simple protocols in different scenarios, gaining insight to design the next protocol generation with performance and efficiency in mind.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2426-9; POD:978-1-4244-2425-2","10.1109/CCE.2008.4578935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4578935","Chunk-Based Distribution;Distributed Systems;Information Exchange;Overlay;P2P networks;Push/Pull Protocols;Simulation;Streaming","Business communication;Content based retrieval;Foot;IP networks;Information retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Streaming media;TV;Web and internet services","Internet;media streaming;peer-to-peer computing;protocols","Internet;P2P push-pull protocols;file-based communications;high- bandwidth media streaming;interleave protocols;mesh- based swarming push-pull systems;peer-to-peer communication paradigm","","9","","20","","","4-6 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These algorithms are based on the neural networks (NNs) regression technique employed for the inversion of a radiative transfer equation (RTE). For the algorithm development the numerical integration of RTE was carried out for the channel characteristics of a Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), and brightness temperatures (T<sub>B</sub>) were simulated for non-precipitating conditions over the open ocean. Sets of sea surface temperatures (Ts), surface winds and radiosonde reports collected by Russian research vessels served as input data for the integration. Only data with Ts less than 15degC were selected for algorithm development. Simulated radiometer noise was added to the calculated values of TB. Once developed, using theoretically simulated values of T<sub>B</sub>, the Q algorithms were then validated both for SSM/I and AMSR-E retrievals using satellite radiometric measurements collocated in space and time with polar station radiosonde data. The resulting SSM retrieval error proved to be 1.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, AMSR-E retrieval error -0.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Considered case study was the polar low in the Norwegian Sea occurred 30-31 January 2008. NOAA AVHRR, Terra and Aqua MODIS images, QuikSCAT-retrieved wind fields, Envisat ASAR images as well as weather maps were used as ancillary data to passive microwave retrievals to study this phenomenon.","","POD:978-1-4244-1986-9","10.1109/MICRAD.2008.4579501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579501","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E);Neural Networks (NNs);Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE);Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I);brightness temperature;retrieval algorithm;total atmospheric water vapor content (Q);total cloud liquid water content (W)","Arctic;Clouds;Content based retrieval;Information retrieval;Microwave radiometry;Ocean temperature;Satellite broadcasting;Sea surface;Temperature sensors;Wind","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric techniques;clouds;neural nets;ocean temperature;radiative transfer;radiometry;regression analysis;wind","arctic polar algorithms;atmospheric water parameter retrievals;microwave radiometer;satellite passive microwave data;total atmospheric water vapor content;total cloud liquid water content","","0","","12","","","11-14 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The WCH produces a more accurate representation of the image features than does a histogram of edge direction angles in an image, since it captures the edge information and intensity variations in the image as well as the spatial separation of these features more accurately. We compare the results produced by our system to the results produced by the edge gradient histogram (EGH); a histogram of the direction angles of edges in an image.

Eleftheriou","","IEEE Control Systems","20080716","2008","28","4","26","35","Probe-based data-storage devices are being considered as an ultra-high-density, small- form-factor alternative to conventional data storage. The probe-based data-storage concept is derived from scanning-probe microscopy, where nanometer-sharp tips are used to interrogate and manipulate matter down to the atomic scale. One implementation of this concept is based on a thermomechanical principle for storing and retrieving data encoded as nanometer-scale indentations in thin polymer films. Ultra-high densities of more than 1 Tb/in<sup>2</sup> have been achieved with this scheme. A small-scaleprototype system comprising all of the elements of a probe- based data storage device has been developed. One of the key challenges is the positioning of the storage medium relative to the read/write probes with nanometer-scale accuracy. A microscanner with X/Y motion capability is used to position the storage medium. Position information along both scan directions is provided by a pair of thermal position sensors. In addition, medium-derived position information provides a measure of the cross-track deviations in the Y-scan direction. Control architectures for both scan directions are presented. The X control architecture relies on thermal position sensors alone, whereas the Y control architecture relies on both the thermal position sensors and the medium-derived PES. Nanometer-scale positioning accuracies are achieved over a bandwidth of a few hundred hertz. Read/write demonstrations with sufficiently low error rates demonstrate the efficacy of the nanopositioning schemes employed.","1066-033X;1066033X","","10.1109/MCS.2008.924795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4566028","","Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Memory;Microscopy;Nanopositioning;Polymer films;Position measurement;Probes;Thermal sensors;Thermomechanical processes","","","","30","","13","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For video search and retrieval, query by example is a common technique, which proved its capability even for image features. However, complex properties of video clips even in the temporal domain can hardly be described via examples as they often fail to capture the relevant information. Hence, high-level semantic information seems much more appropriate for future video search and retrieval engines fully based on user-friendly interfaces. Well known self-calibration techniques provide robust and reliable information on camera motion, but this rich source of information is not well exploited for high-level semantic video annotation, search and retrieval. The full temporal information along the sequence is evaluated and exploited for the annotation of meaningful high-level semantics such as turn, rotation, fast moving camera, transversal motion and so on. We present a first approach to derive generalmotion properties of the camera motion within video segments and show the potential for further investigations.","1949-3983;19493983","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2044-5; POD:978-1-4244-2043-8","10.1109/CBMI.2008.4564956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564956","","Cameras;Data mining;Face detection;Image reconstruction;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Material storage;Multimedia communication;Optical character recognition software","image sensors;user interfaces;video retrieval;video signal processing","3D camera motion information;self-calibration techniques;semantic annotation;unedited video;user-friendly interfaces;video retrieval;video search","","1","","7","","","18-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, to support the poetry appreciation learning, our idea is to provide the Immersive Poetry Learning with multimedia properties: the Vision such as scenic spot, the Reading with occasional poetry, and the Emotional Reinforcement such as background music. To construct the immersive poetry learning with multimedia environment, the Learning Context ontology, the Poetry Noun Ontology and the Music Emotion ontology are defined to annotate the context information poetry contents and music emotional properties.

At this step, we can build a contingency table crossing rdquovisual wordsrdquo as terms/words and images as documents. In spite of its successful applications in information retrieval, FCA suffers from large dimension problem because of the diagonalization of a large matrix. We propose a new algorithm, CABoost, which overcomes this large dimension problem of FCA. The data are sampled by column (word) and a FCA is applied on the sample. After some samplings, we finally combine separated results by a weighting - principle component analysis (PCA).

An image retrieval method combined color and texture features is proposed in this paper. According to image texture characteristic, a kind of image feature statistic is defined. By using feature weight assignment operators designed here, the method can assign weight to the color and texture features according to image content adaptively and realize image retrieval based on combined image features.

Unlike other shape representation schemes, the proposed scheme is able to extract attributes from both contour as well as region information without the need for special landmarks or key-points. It does not require points on the edge with their orders, but it can capture the feature of shapes with holes or even with separated regions. In addition, the proposed method is shown to be unaffected by image translation, rotation and scaling; at the same time, it is robust to minor occultation, non-rigid deformations, distortions and corruption due to noise. Several experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the chord context descriptor methodology and also highlight its advantages over other existing methodologies.","","POD:978-0-7695-3271-4","10.1109/VIS.2008.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4568674","Feature extraction;chord;histogram;shape description;shape retrieval","Feature extraction;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Noise robustness;Noise shaping;Object recognition;Robust stability;Shape measurement","content-based retrieval;image matching;image retrieval;matrix algebra;object recognition","chord context descriptor methodology;content-based image retrieval;feature matrix;frequency distribution;image translation;nonrigid deformations;object recognition;shape descriptor;shape matching","","3","","22","","","9-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of these monitoring approaches focus on bilateral agreements between partners. However, when monitoring composite services it is not only important to figure out whether SLAs are violated, but we also need to analyze why these violations have occurred. When offering a composite service a company depends on its content providers to meet the service level they agreed upon. Due to these dependencies a company should not only monitor the SLA of the composite service, but also the SLAs of the services it depends on. By analyzing and monitoring the composite service in this way, causes for SLA violations can be easier found. In this paper we demonstrate how to analyze SLAs during development phase and how to monitor these dependencies using event logs during runtime.

This language constitutes the interface between a client and a search engine for searching multimedia data. Another possible scenario is the use of a service provider, which accepts and understands a query from a client and forwards parts of the query to one or more specific databases. Furthermore the service provider is able to retrieve the reply from these databases and post processes this result in order to send it to this client. During the last years, the cross-modal search of video and audio signals became more and more important, since using both, the video and the audio signal together turned out to be much more robust for identification of video streams, than the image part of the video alone.This paper describes a cross-modal search based on the MPEG Query Format, using a service provider for splitting and aggregating the query and two different types of databases.","2158-5873;21585873","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3130-4; POD:978-0-7695-3344-5","10.1109/WIAMIS.2008.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4556921","","Content based retrieval;Image analysis;Image databases;Information retrieval;Information technology;Motion pictures;Multimedia databases;Music information retrieval;Robustness;Signal processing","multimedia databases;search engines;video retrieval","MPEG query format;audio signals;cross-modal search;distributed cross-modal search;multimedia content retrieval;multimedia content search;search engine;video signals","","4","1","6","","","7-9 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, we modify the composite descriptor by replacing contour features with corner-points features. The proposed descriptor is obtained from Generic FourierDescriptors (GFD) of the shape region and the GFD ofthe corner-points. We study the performance of the proposed composite descriptor.

Semantic matchmaker enhances the capability of UDDI service registries in the Semantic Web Services architecture by applying some matching algorithms between advertisements and requests described in OWL-S to recognize various degrees of matching for Web services.

The first step of our method is to divide all images into different scene planar regions and to retrieve all regions from the projective distortions, so that the visible information can be directly used; then a new inpainting algorithm with a pyramid approach to sub-pixel image fusion based on mutual information is applied.

Many home collections can contain hundreds and thousands of books and CDs. Managing a personal collection of such magnitude could be difficult if one were to rely on using databases or spread sheets. Entering detailed information of each item is a huge undertaking and tedious work. We present a solution to solve this complexity by building an online service to manage a home library. The online service maintains a database to record each userpsilas collection. The users will scan the bar code of the books and CDs. The detailed information of the items will be retrieved from Amazon.com via Amazon Associates Web Service interface and automatically entered into the database. Users are able to edit and search their items. A simple loan management functionality is provided to allow users to borrow out items. Doing so would allow them to share their collections with their friends. Compared to other commercial products for managing home libraries, our solution is a purely online service that absolves users from performing complicated installations and maintenance. The usage of Amazon.compsilas Web Service to retrieve item information provides a reliable source for information retrieval. This is due to the currency of information available and the fact that Amazon.com has one of the largest catalogues of items, from books, CDs to home appliances. All these are made available via the Amazon Associates Web Service. Our system can be extended to manage other items such as prescription medications, and kitchen items.

Every pieces of music must follow some rhythms and music of different regions differs from each other. To identify the difference we have to retrieve the hidden rhythms of music and also have to identify its properties. A common way to represent a rhythm is as a binary format where dasia1psila indicates a clap (sound) and dasia0psila indicates a wave (silence). In this paper, mathematical and geometrical representation of rhythms is analyzed with a view to building a classification system that cans categories rhythms of various regions. Based on various distance matrices, Toussaint has shown a single polygonal model to classify Africa, Brazilian and Cuban rhythms. The same mechanism is followed and also applied on The North Indian rhythms, used in India and Bangladesh. In this paper, turning function, a function for polygon similarity measurement, is used to measure the distance among various rhythms. Various types of phylogenetic trees are also used to represent the graphical classification system. Single polygonal model to represent the rhythm is easier but there are some North Indian rhythms which are not possible to represent in that format.

This method segments images into homogeneous regions and gives name for each region. In addition, the importance of each region is also taken into account. The Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) is employed to measure the image similarity.

It calculates the texture and fire & clinker features of the flame image, then, through the similarities comparison, it returns a set of original retrieval results. Moreover, with the users’ relevant feedbacks, it optimizes the final retrieval results. A prototype system was realized based on the rotary kiln image database that contained more than 500 rotary kiln flame images (Sampled in an alumina rotary kiln). Retrieval experiments with different features were carried out. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval methods, and among them, the integrated features based method has the highest precision (84%). The research can provide strong support for modern rotary kiln supervision and management.","","POD:978-0-7695-3119-9","10.1109/CISP.2008.578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4566352","content-based image retrieval;fire & clinker features;relevance feedback;rotary kiln flame image;texture features","Content based retrieval;Digital images;Feature extraction;Feedback;Fires;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Kilns;Watches","","","","1","","11","","","27-30 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this research regionally differing Neural Networks (NN)-based algorithms for total and multiyear Arctic sea ice concentration retrievals from Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) data are developed using closed scheme of the numerical experiment. Era-40 Reanalysis data on atmospheric parameter profiles and sea ice temperature are used for the numerical integration of the radiation transfer of the microwave emission in the Atmosphere-Ocean-Ice System. The data on cloud liquid water content and cloud boundaries are modeled basing on the results of Arctic SHEBA experiment. Numerical values for first year and multiyear ice emissivities are taken from published experimental data. The calculated radiometer brightness temperature values are used for NN-based theoretical algorithm development. New weather filter is defined. The algorithms are validated for stable winter conditions using collocated SSM/I data and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, classified by an ice expert.","","POD:978-1-4244-1986-9","10.1109/MICRAD.2008.4579499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579499","Arctic;Neural Networks;physical modeling;satellite passive microwave","Arctic;Clouds;Image retrieval;Image sensors;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Neural networks;Satellite broadcasting;Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar","atmospheric humidity;climatology;clouds;neural nets;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radiative transfer;sea ice;seawater","Arctic SHEBA experiment;Arctic climate change;Arctic sea ice concentration retrievals;Era-40 reanalysis data;SAR image;atmosphere-ocean-ice system;cloud boundary;cloud liquid water content;global ice monitoring;ice emissivity;microwave emission;multiyear fraction calculation;multiyear ice cover;neural network based algorithm;radiation transfer;satellite passive microwave data;sea ice temperature;special sensor microwave imager;synthetic aperture radar image;weather filter","","0","","14","","","11-14 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, encryption does not provide security once the data are decrypted. Biometric watermarking can overcome this problem. The decrypted biometric data are still embedded in an image container and are only retrieved if a secret key is provided. It has been observed that retrieval error is very high if the embedded biometric data are numeric. We proposed a new method based on amplitude modulation and bit priority to embed high priority bits at good positions to reduce the retrieval error when they are converted to numeric data. Experimental results show a significant error reduction for the proposed method.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2426-9; POD:978-1-4244-2425-2","10.1109/CCE.2008.4578956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4578956","amplitude modulation;biometric watermark;bit priority","Authentication;Bioinformatics;Biometrics;Communication channels;Communication system security;Cryptography;Data security;Image databases;Information retrieval;Watermarking","amplitude modulation;biometrics (access control);cryptography;telecommunication channels;watermarking","amplitude modulation;bit priority-based biometric watermarking;communication channels;decrypted biometric data;encryption;image container;remote biometric authentication systems;retrieval error reduction;security purposes","","1","","21","","","4-6 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the JMA mesoscale model (MSM), retrievals of total column precipitable water (TCPW) and precipitation (PR) are assimilated. A MSC (Meteorological Satellite Center) algorithm is used to retrieve them. In the global spectral model (GSM), radiances of vertically polarized channels in less-cloudy area are assimilated. But cloud-affected radiances are also used. In our NWP experiments, retrievals of cloud liquid water (CLW) from AMSR-E with the MSC algorithm were used to remove the strongly cloud-affected data and to correct the bias which is derived from the thin cloud. The most significant impact on the forecast experiment was the improvement of the temperature at 850 hPa in the tropics.","","POD:978-1-4244-1986-9","10.1109/MICRAD.2008.4579457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579457","","Clouds;Data assimilation;Earth Observing System;GSM;Information retrieval;Meteorology;Microwave radiometry;Polarization;Satellite broadcasting;Weather forecasting","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric precipitation;atmospheric techniques;clouds;data assimilation;radiometry;weather forecasting","AMSR-E;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS;Earth Observing System;JMA MSM;JMA mesoscale model;Japan Meteorological Agency;MSC algorithm;Meteorological Satellite Center;NWP;cloud affected radiances;cloud liquid water;data assimilation systems;global spectral model;numerical weather prediction;total column precipitable water;total column precipitation","","0","","6","","","11-14 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key limitation of this interface is poor handling of iterative search. While browsing the results users have to memorize all new search constraints, go back to the form, and enter them into the appropriate fields. To overcome this obstacle we created Natural Search Pointers -a structured information search interface, which formulates search queries based on information highlighted by a user while browsing the search results. NSP can be used as an extension of any standard form-based interface for consumer-oriented database search engines. Comparison of traditional form-based interface and its NSP extension shows that in iterative search tasks NSP makes finding information faster and more convenient.","2158-2246;21582246","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1543-4; POD:978-1-4244-1542-7","10.1109/HSI.2008.4581436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4581436","","Cities and towns;Computer science;Databases;Information retrieval;Keyboards;Mice;Natural languages;Navigation;Search engines;Switches","application program interfaces;query formulation;search engines","NSP;consumer-oriented database search engines;form-based interface;natural search pointers;query formulation method;search queries;structured information search","","0","","17","","","25-27 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In RFID system, the reader needs the anti collision algorithm for fast identifying all of the tags in the interrogation zone. This paper proposes the tree based anti collision algorithm using parity bit (ACPB) to arbitrate the tag collision. The proposed algorithm identifies tags without checking all the bits in the tags. The reader uses the parity bit which is added to the tag IDs. If there are two collided bits in tags, then reader identify tags by the parity concept. The reader can identify two tags using ACPB algorithm. ACPB can reduce the number of the requests from the reader, thus it shortens the time of identifying all of the tags in the interrogation zone.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3192-2","10.1109/NCA.2008.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579660","Anti Collision;Parity Bit;RFID;Tag","Application software;Computer applications;Computer networks;Food technology;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Signal processing;Transponders","radiofrequency identification","RFID system;anti collision algorithm using parity bit;electronic tags;radio frequency identification","","5","","8","","","10-12 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
