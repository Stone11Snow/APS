At the same time, the traditional method ignored the true meaning of the terms. However, the semantic Web has been created to improve the disadvantage. Ontology is the fundamental element of the semantic Web that is a kind of knowledge presentation and can present the variety of property for concept. According to the regulation of Department of Health, Executive Yuan, R.O.C, the hospital has implemented the new hospital accreditation from 2005. Furthermore, the hospital accreditation evolves the variety of items of accreditation. Medical adverse event reporting is a kind of the hospital accreditation. The system which can deal with the medical adverse event reporting is operated by human at present. None the less, the system caused some questions, such as inconsistent knowledge and human negligence. The research proposed a new framework which can replace the human automatically. We get concepts through extraction of information and analyze sentences through classification of events. After that we analyze those classes which can construct variable and dynamic ontology in medical adverse event reporting.","","POD:978-0-7695-3745-0","10.1109/HIS.2009.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254360","Backpropagation;Classify;Knowledge Presentation;Medical adverse event;Ontology","Accreditation;Data mining;Hospitals;Humans;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Internet;Machine intelligence;Ontologies;Semantic Web","accreditation;information retrieval;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;semantic Web","Internet;domain knowledge extraction;hospital accreditation;information retrieval;knowledge presentation;knowledge sharing;medical adverse event reporting;medical adverse events classification;ontology;semantic Web","","0","","28","","","12-14 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents recent research on optimizing the simultaneous classification of documents, photos and logos. Each of these is handled during printing with a class-specific pipeline of image transformation algorithms, and misclassification results in pejorative imaging effects. This paper reports on replacing an existing classifier with a Weka-based classifier that simultaneously improves accuracy (from 85.3% to 90.8%) and performance (from 1458 msec to 418 msec/image). Generic subsampling of the images further improved the performance (to 199 msec/image) with only a modest impact on accuracy (to 90.4%). A staggered subsampling approach, finally, improved both accuracy (to 96.4%) and performance (to 147 msec/image) for the Weka-base classifier. This approach did not appreciable benefit the HP classifier (85.4% accuracy, 497 msec/image). These data indicate staggered subsampling using the optimized Weka classifier substantially improves the classification accuracy and performance without resulting in additional ldquoegregiousrdquo misclassifications (assigning photos or logos to the ldquodocumentrdquo class).","1520-5363;15205363","POD:978-1-4244-4500-4","10.1109/ICDAR.2009.167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5277475","","Image analysis;Image classification;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Pipelines;Printing;Rendering (computer graphics);Spatial databases;Text analysis","document image processing;image classification;image sampling;rendering (computer graphics)","Weka-based classifier;class-specific pipeline;image classification;image sampling;image transformation algorithm;mixed-type document;pejorative imaging effect;printing quality;task rendering","","2","","12","","","26-29 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the color descriptors, however, show severe limitations and drawbacks due to their incapability of modeling the human color perception. Moreover, they cannot characterize all the properties of the color composition in visual scenery. In this paper we present a perceptual color feature, which describes all major properties of prominent colors both in spatial and color domain. In accordance with the well-known Gestalt law, we adopt a top-down approach in order to model (see) the whole color composition before its parts and in this way we can avoid the problems of pixel-based approaches. In color domain the dominant colors are extracted along with their global properties and quad-tree decomposition partitions the image so as to characterize the spatial color distribution (SCD). The proposed color model distills the histogram of inter-color distances. Combination of the extracted global and spatial properties forms the final descriptor, which is neither biased nor become noisy from the presence of such color elements that cannot be perceived in both spatial and color domains. Finally a penalty-trio model fuses all color properties in a similarity distance computation during retrieval. Experimental results approve the superiority of the proposed technique against well-known global and spatial descriptors.","","POD:978-1-4244-3756-6","10.1109/MMCS.2009.5256714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5256714","Content-based Retrieval;Perceptual Color Model;Spatial Color Descriptor;component","Color;Colored noise;Content based retrieval;Distributed control;Histograms;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Performance evaluation","content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;image retrieval;quadtrees;statistical analysis","CBIR;Gestalt law;SCD;content-based image retrieval;perceptual color descriptor;pixel-based approach;proximity histogram;quad-tree decomposition;spatial color distribution;spatial distribution model;top-down approach","","0","","26","","","2-4 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence the traditional process relies significantly on humans and their personal interrelationship. However with an increasing in the availability and accessibility of R&D information in electronic forms, one can apply techniques in the fields of information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning to automatically retrieve experts and their areas of expertise from such information sources. In this paper, we present an approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method to discover experts and their associated areas of expertise from R&D bibliographic data. The LDA method could generate multiple hidden topics underlying the given data set. These topics are representatives for those multiple areas of expertise in which individual experts could be assigned into.

The SCORM standard has changed this by including contextual metadata as part of the resource. However, SCORM LOs are scarcely created, much as a result of high knowledge and time requirements needed for creating the necessary metadata. This research has been using Automatic Metadata Generation tools to assist in the metadata creation process, enabling LOs to share common contextual metadata while receiving additional high quality LO specific metadata without the need for manual metadata creation efforts.","2150-4938;21504938","POD:978-1-4244-2345-3","10.1109/DEST.2009.5276729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276729","Algorithms;Experimentation;Reliability;Verification","Data mining;Ecosystems;Electronic mail;Humans;Information retrieval;Information science;Least squares approximation;Standards publication;Technology management;Testing","Internet;computer aided instruction;meta data","Internet;SCORM learning objects;automatic metadata generation tools;contextual metadata;educational purposes;knowledge requirements;time requirements","","1","","41","","","1-3 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A related, far less explored primitive is to obtain the dataset elements which would have the query object within their own k-nearest neighbors, known as the reverse k-nearest neighbor query. We already have indices and algorithms to solve k-nearest neighbors queries in general metric spaces; yet, in many cases of practical interest they degenerate to sequential scanning. The naive algorithm for reverse k-nearest neighbor queries has quadratic complexity, because the k-nearest neighbors of all the dataset objects must be found; this is too expensive. Hence, when solving these primitives we can tolerate trading correctness in the solution for searching time. In this paper we propose an efficient approximate approach to solve these similarity queries with high retrieval rate. Then, we show how to use our approximate k-nearest neighbor queries to construct (an approximation of) the k-nearest neighbor graph when we have a fixed dataset. Finally, combining both primitives we show how to dynamically maintain the approximate k-nearest neighbor graph of the objects currently stored within the metric dataset, that is, considering both object insertions and deletions.","","POD:978-0-7695-3765-8","10.1109/SISAP.2009.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5271946","Metric space searching;Nearest neighbor queries;Reverse nearest neighbor queries","Application software;Computer science;Databases;Electronic mail;Extraterrestrial measurements;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Neural networks;Pattern classification","computational complexity;graph theory;query processing;search problems","naive algorithm;nearest neighbor graph;quadratic complexity;reverse nearest neighbor query;sequential scanning","","0","1","34","","","29-30 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A multimedia presentation contains various kinds of multimedia objects such as audio, video, images, and so on. The organization of a presentation is a complex task in that the display order of presentation content (in time and space) must be specified. The critical decisions for presentation construction include content selection, content organization, and content delivery. Once the decision is made on the organization of the presentation content, it must be conveyed to the end user in the correct organizational order and in a timely fashion. Assuming that a set of multimedia segments gets organized into a presentation graph, this conceptual model formalizes a complete presentation using event-points for these segments. End-user environments of multimedia presentation are considered for the playout such as (i) the one without any constraint, (ii) another one with a single constraint, and (iii) the third one with multiple constraints (one constraint for each type of segments in the organized presentation). In accordance with these limitations (without violating any of the specified constraints), three methods are given for constructed presentations to be presented.","2155-8728;21558728","POD:978-1-4244-4614-8","10.1109/NDT.2009.5272109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5272109","","Auditory displays;Collaboration;High-speed networks;Image segmentation;Information resources;Information retrieval;Internet;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Streaming media","data models;directed graphs;formal specification;multimedia computing;technical presentation","audio object;conceptual model;content delivery;content organization;content selection;directed acyclic graph;end-user environment;image object;multimedia presentation;multimedia segment;presentation graph;temporal event specification model;tuple-based model;video object","","0","","25","","","28-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a feature representation scheme as visual concept structure descriptor (VCSD) that overcomes this challenge and captures both the concept frequency similar to a color histogram and the local spatial relationships of the concepts. A probabilistic framework makes the descriptor robust against classification and quantization errors.

The use of ontological views assists the pedagogical content of metadata extracted from learning objects by using the control vocabularies as identified from the metametadata taxonomy. The use of ontological approach and metametadata (based on the metametadata taxonomy) have contributed towards a novel semantic searching mechanism.

"Assessing similarity between cases by means of fuzzy rules","N.

However, the meaning of ldquosimilarityrdquo can vary in different situations and remains an issue. This paper proposes a novel similarity model consisting of fuzzy rules to represent the semantics and evaluation criteria for similarity. We believe that fuzzy if-then rules present a more powerful and flexible means to capture domain knowledge for utility oriented similarity modeling than traditional similarity measures based on feature weighting. Fuzzy rule-based reasoning is utilized as a case matching mechanism to determine whether and to which extent a known case in the case library is similar to a given problem in query. Further, we explain that such fuzzy rules for similarity assessment can be learned from the case library. The key to achieving this is pair-wise comparisons of cases with known solutions in the case library such that sufficient training samples can be derived for fuzzy rule learning. The evaluations conducted have shown that the proposed method yields more precise similarity values to approximate case utility than conventional ways of similarity modeling and that fuzzy similarity rules can be learned from a rather small case base without the risk of over-fitting.","1098-7584;10987584","POD:978-1-4244-3596-8","10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5277293","","Containers;Feedback;Fuzzy reasoning;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Information retrieval;Knowledge based systems;Learning systems;Libraries;Weight measurement","case-based reasoning;fuzzy reasoning","approximate case utility;case library;case-based reasoning;domain knowledge;feature weighting;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy rule learning;fuzzy rule-based reasoning;fuzzy similarity rules;matching mechanism;similarity assessment;similarity evaluation criteria;similarity measures;utility oriented similarity modeling","","0","","19","","","20-24 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present an architecture for a load balanced and reliable RDF storage system for semantic information distributed over a peer-to-peer network. Peers are self organized in a ring topology, based on a distributed hash table (DHT), where each node is assigned a segment of the key space that can dynamically change in order to maintain a uniform distribution of the data among the participating peers. Data redundancy is then used to replicate each RDF triple in multiple locations so that, in case of peer failures, neighbour nodes can act on their behalf and return consistent results. Additionally, each node provides an entry point able to resolve atomic, disjunctive and conjunctive SPARQL queries on the network semantic knowledge. The performance of this approach is evaluated by monitoring the effectiveness of the load balancing and redundancy algorithm and the overhead introduced on the network load in both a static (only join events) and dynamic scenario.","2155-8728;21558728","POD:978-1-4244-4614-8","10.1109/NDT.2009.5272090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5272090","","Bandwidth;Delay;Information retrieval;Load management;Maintenance;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Redundancy;Resource description framework;Routing","knowledge management;peer-to-peer computing;query processing;resource allocation;semantic Web;semantic networks;storage management","conjunctive SPARQL queries;data fragmentation;data redundancy algorithm;distributed RDF storage system;distributed hash table;knowledge management system;network load balancing;node failures;peer-to-peer architecture;ring topology;semantic Web;semantic knowledge network","","2","","16","","","28-31 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Incorporating HL7 functionality into existing applications requires significant modification and intrusive extensions. Using aspect-oriented programming (AOP), we can introduce HL7 functionality into existing applications without the requirement for refactoring or modification. HL7 data formatting affects multiple parts of an application and hence is a ldquocrosscut-ting concernrdquo. These concerns which entwine with base functionality introduce complexity and reduce modularity. A second benefit of AOP is its advanced modularisation capabilities which are capable of modularising ldquocrosscut-ting concernsrdquo.

Although some researches have identified several data flow issues, however, data flow changes and their influence on running workflow instances have been neglected. In this paper, we first present a dataflow-constrained workflow net, and give a simple yet effective algorithm of model checking to guarantee both the structural and the data flow correctness of the modified model. Then we propose a correct transfer criterion to determine the compliance of a workflow instance with a changed workflow specification and state the conditions of transferring existing instances to the changed workflow specification.

Currently, relation extraction of Chinese named entities mainly adopts the vector space model (VSM) or a traditional semantic computing method, and these two methods use either the location features or the semantic features only, resulting in unsatisfactory extraction. To improve the extraction results, we propose a method that combines the information gain of the positions of words and the semantic computing based on HowNet to extract Chinese named entity relations, and present a relation extraction method of Chinese named entities, called LSE, which is scalable, semi-supervised and domain independent.

However, a general, efficient and scalable solution for metric data management is still a resisting research challenge. We introduce a novel indexing and searching mechanism called metric index (M-Index), that employs practically all known principles of metric space partitioning, pruning and filtering. The heart of the M-Index is a general mapping mechanism that enables to actually store the data in well-established structures such as the B<sup>+</sup>-tree or even in a distributed storage. We have implemented the M-Index with B<sup>+</sup>-tree and performed experiments on a combination of five MPEG-7 descriptors in a database of hundreds of thousands digital images. The experiments put under test several M-Index variants and compare them with two orthogonal approaches - the PM-Tree and the iDistance. The trials show that the M-Index outperforms the others in terms of efficiency of search-space pruning, I/O costs, and response times for precise similarity queries. Furthermore, the M-Index demonstrates an excellent ability to keep similar data close in the index which makes its approximation algorithm very efficient-maintaining practically constant response times while preserving a very high recall as the dataset grows.","","POD:978-0-7695-3765-8","10.1109/SISAP.2009.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5272384","approximation;data structure;metric space;scalability;similarity search","Delay;Digital images;Extraterrestrial measurements;Filtering;Heart;Image databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Testing","indexing;information filtering;tree data structures","B<sup>+</sup>-tree;approximation algorithm;distributed storage;information filtering;mapping mechanism;metric data management;metric index;metric space partitioning;metric space pruning;nontext information retrieval;novel indexing;similarity search","","8","","21","","","29-30 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The four channels of periodic pulses from button-type PSDs are bandpass filtered, amplified to get 500 MHz sinusoids. Four under-sampling ADCs digitalize these sinusoids. The sampled IF signals are decimated by a ratio of 169 with digital down-converters (DDC) implemented in FPGA. IQ data of DDC are sent to cordic blocks and converted to amplitude and phase data.

As a result, many time series representations and distance measures have been proposed. However, most existing work on time series similarity search focuses on finding shape-based similarity. While some of the existing approaches work well for short time series data, they typically fail to produce satisfactory results when the sequence is long. For long sequences, it is more appropriate to consider the similarity based on the higher-level structures. This is particularly true for medical time series, as they often are not perfectly aligned.

"Meeting NERC requirements for oscillography and disturbance monitoring by collecting data from relays","C. Jones; D. Smith; J. Schnegg","American Electric Power","2009 Power Systems Conference","20090925","2009","","","1","9","The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the region reliability councils have mandated electric utilities to monitor their power systems at critical locations throughout their system. The monitoring systems are to be phased into service by 2010. American Electric Power (AEP) and Tarigma Corporation with assistance from Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. (SEL) have developed a disturbance monitoring system to provide an alternative to traditional monitoring equipment to meet these monitoring requirements. This paper will discuss the collection of event and synchrophasor data from relays to satisfy the NERC requirements for disturbance monitoring. Event data from relays on the AEP system is currently retrieved, stored locally and then moved to several server sites on the AEP system. This same approach will be taken with synchrophasors and allow AEP to use this data to meet the disturbance requirements mandated by NERC. Combining these two approaches provides the means for AEP to save millions of dollars by not having to purchase conventional recording equipment for their system in order to meet the NERC requirements. This approach provides a very cost-effective means of capturing event and disturbance data in stations that could typically justify the need for conventional recording equipment. Since this approach is a fraction of the cost of traditional disturbance monitoring equipment, monitoring can be justified in smaller stations. This paper addresses the challenges of retrieving the data from relays in a way that meets the NERC requirements. The economics of the traditional approach of collecting data versus using data captured by relays will be contrasted. Techniques for storing the data locally and moving the data efficiently and securely to corporate servers for engineering access will also be examined.","","POD:978-1-4244-5248-4","10.1109/PSAMP.2009.5262474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5262474","","Councils;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Power engineering and energy;Power industry;Power system relaying;Power system reliability;Relays;Reliability engineering","SCADA systems;computerised monitoring;power engineering computing;power system management;power system measurement;power system relaying;power system reliability","NERC requirement;North American Electric Reliability Corporation;corporate server;disturbance monitoring;oscillography monitoring;relay data;synchrophasor data","","0","","","","","10-13 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the rapid growth of diverse data driven applications in the current information era, retrieving string data from heterogeneous structured sources becomes more and more significant and challenging. The main concern is duplicate records are created when data is integrated from heterogeneous sources. Those duplicate records represent the same real-world entity because of inconsistent values and naming conventions, incorrect or missing data values, or incomplete information. Existing approaches make the assumption that group of related attributes will participate in the similarity join operation. However, in this paper we propose a pre-processing technique to improve existing similarity join techniques. Assuming relational data sources, our approach is to identify groups of related attributes that when similarity join is applied, we reduce false positives and false negatives, and increase precisions and F-measure.","","POD:978-1-4244-4456-4","10.1109/ICADIWT.2009.5273906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5273906","","Application software;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Histograms;Hospitals;Information retrieval;Information science;Query processing;Relational databases;Telephony","data handling;data mining;pattern clustering","duplicate records;relational data sources;similarity join algorithm;vertical clustering technique","","1","","15","","","4-6 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a fine granular estimate we consider data-driven regression next to classification based on support vector machines. Alternatively the on-line knowledge sources ConceptNet, general inquirer, and WordNet not only serve to reduce out-of-vocabulary events, but also as basis for a purely linguistic analysis.

Recently the ontology repository gets more attentions as a component of ubiquitous systems. This paper describes use of the path index to answer complex queries in ontology repository. Studies show that two types of queries namely chain queries and star queries frequently occur in SPARQL queries. Instead of using join operations over several triple indexes, we proposed to use path indexes for such queries, which in turn improve the query performance reducing the number of multiple join operations. Our experiments show that the proposed method enhances the query performance than using only indexes based on single triple pattern.","","POD:978-0-7695-3701-6","10.1109/ICCSA.2009.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5260960","","Application software;Data mining;Databases;Fabrics;Indexing;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Pervasive computing;Resource description framework;XML","ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;ubiquitous computing","SPARQL queries;chain queries;complex queries;ontology repository;path indexes;star queries;ubiquitous systems","","0","","18","","","June 29 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The content-based learning approach applies text mining methods to extract ontology concepts, and to build an ontology graph (OG) through the automatic learning of Web documents. The user-based learning approach applies features analysis methods to extract the subset of the ontology graphs, in order to build a personalized ontology by using intelligent agent approach to capture user reading habit and preference through their semantic navigation and search over the ontology-based Web content. This system combines the two methods to create collaborative ontology learning through an ontology matching and refinement process on the ontology created from content-based learning and user-based learning.

In this paper, a synopsis with minimum amount tuples is proposed, which sufficient for answering the top-k query. And this synopsis can be dynamic maintained with new tuples been added.

In the proposed technique, we first model the relationship between diseases, symptoms, signs and other clinical information as a graph and apply concept lattice analysis to extract all possible diagnostic hypotheses related to a specific scenario. Next, we identify relevant information regarding the extracted hypotheses and search for matching evidences in the patient's EHR.
