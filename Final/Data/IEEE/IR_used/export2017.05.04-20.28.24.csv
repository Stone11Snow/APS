"Integrating image and text information for biomedical information retrieval","S.

The search for relevant and actionable information is key to achieving clinical and research goals in biomedicine. Biomedical information exists in different forms: as text and illustrations in journal articles and other documents, in ""images"" stored in databases, and as patients' cases in electronic health records. In the context of this work an ""image"" includes not only biomedical images, but also illustrations, charts, graphs, and other visual material appearing in biomedical journals, electronic health records, and other relevant databases. The tutorial will cover methods and techniques to retrieve information from these entities, by moving beyond conventional text-based searching to combining both text and visual features in search queries. The approaches to meeting these objectives use a combination of techniques and tools from the fields of Information Retrieval (IK), Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The tutorial will discuss steps to improve the retrieval of biomedical literature by targeting the text describing the visual content in articles (figures, including illustrations and images), a rich source of information not typically exploited by conventional bibliographic or full-text databases. Taking this a step further we will explore challenges in finding information relevant to a patient's case from the literature and then link it to the patient's health record. The case is first represented in structured form using both text and image features, and then literature and EHR databases can be searched for similar cases. Further, we will discuss steps to automatically find semantically similar images in image databases, which is an important step in differential diagnosis. Automatic image annotation and retrieval steps will be described that use image features and a combination of image and text features. We explore steps toward generating a ""visual ontology"", i.e., concepts assigned to i- - mage patches. Elements from the visual ontology are called ""visual keywords"" and are used to find images with similar concepts. The tutorial will demonstrate some of these techniques by demonstrating our Image and Text Search Engine (ITSE), a hybrid system combining NLM's Essie text search engine with CEB's image similarity engine.","1063-7125;10637125","Electronic:978-1-4244-9168-1; POD:978-1-4244-9167-4","10.1109/CBMS.2010.6042631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042631","","Biomedical imaging;Natural language processing;Search engines;Tutorials;Visual databases;Visualization","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;medical information systems;natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);search engines;text analysis","EHR databases;NLM Essie text search engine;biomedical images;biomedical information retrieval;biomedical journals;content based image retrieval;documents;electronic health records;image and text search engine;image information;image patches;image similarity engine;natural language processing;search queries;text information;visual keywords;visual ontology","","0","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The two main classes of conflation algorithms are string-similarity algorithms and stemming algorithms. Stemming is used in information retrieval systems to reduce variant word forms to common roots in order to improve retrieval effectiveness. As in other languages, there is a need for an effective stemming algorithm for the indexing and retrieval of Malay documents. Again there are few research on n-gram string-similarity measures done on Malay. We have experimented on the application of stemming and string similarity matching on retrieving of verses from the Al-Quran in order to evaluated their effectiveness. Before retrieval effectiveness can be carried out an experimental data set need to be developed which comprises of a collection of documents, a set of queries, and their relevant judgements. In this paper we will describe the development of the experimental data set and the application of stemming and similarity matching algorithms in retrieving the verses from the Al-Quran. Inherent characteristics of n-grams and several variations of experiments performed on the queries and documents are discussed. The variations are: both non-stemmed queries and documents; stemmed queries and nonstemmed documents; and both stemmed queries and documents. Further experiment are then carried out by removing the most frequently occurring n-gram. The dice-coefficient is used as threshold and weight in ranking the retrieved documents. Beside using dice coefficients to rank documents, inverse document frequency weights are also used. Interpolation technique and standard recall-precision functions are used to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness.","2155-6822;21556822","Electronic:978-1-4577-0752-0; POD:978-1-4577-0753-7","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021578","Information Retrieval;Natural Language Processing;Stemming;n-gram","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Educational institutions;Indexes;Information retrieval;Information science;Natural languages","document handling;information retrieval;interpolation;string matching","Al-Quran verse retrieval;Malay document indexing;Malay document retrieval;Malay information retrieval;conflation algorithm;dice coefficient;document ranking;interpolation technique;inverse document frequency weight;n-gram string-similarity measures;recall-precision function;stemming algorithm;string similarity matching","","1","","18","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Applying Information Retrieval to Distributed Hash Table (DHT) Systems","S. G. Fantar; H. Youssef","Res. Unit Prince, Univ. of Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia","2011 11th Annual International Conference on New Technologies of Distributed Systems","20110718","2011","","","1","7","Distributed Peer to peer systems such as Chord allow peers to perform efficient searches using object identifiers rather than keywords. More specifically, they use a specific structure with some hashing scheme that allows peers to perform object lookup operations getting in return the address of the node storing the object. Lookups are achieved by following a path that increasingly progresses to the destination. These systems have been designed to optimize object retrieval by minimizing the number of messages and hops required to retrieve the object. The disadvantage is that they consider only the problem of searching for keys, and thus cannot capture the relevance of the documents stored in the system. This common problem with existing traditional distributed hash table (DHT) is done because they usually ignore the information retrieval algorithms, and thereby rely on keyword based searches. In this paper, we first propose to augment the P2P DHT system Chord with mechanisms for locating data using the information retrieval system LSI to facilitate content-based full-text search in large distributed information systems. Chord-LSI uses latent semantic indexing (LSI) to guide content placement in a Chord such that documents relevant to a query are likely be collocated on a small number of nodes. During a search, Chord-LSI transmit a small amount of data and search a small number of nodes. Simulation results show that Chord-LSI model is 17% more effective than Chord models.","2162-1896;21621896","Electronic:978-1-4577-0729-2; POD:978-1-4799-1693-1","10.1109/NOTERE.2011.5957990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5957990","","Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Matrix decomposition;Peer to peer computing;Semantics","content-based retrieval;file organisation;indexing;peer-to-peer computing","Chord;P2P DHT system;content placement;content-based full-text search;data location;distributed hash table system;distributed peer-to-peer system;document relevance;hashing scheme;hop minimization;information retrieval;key searching;large distributed information system;latent semantic indexing;message minimization;node address;object lookup operation;object retrieval","","1","","29","","","9-13 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach combines the following IR-based methods: Vector Space Model (VSM), probabilistic Jensen and Shannon (JS) model, and Relational Topic Modeling (RTM), which has not been used in the context of traceability link recovery before. The empirical case study conducted on six software systems indicates that the integrated method outperforms stand-alone IR methods as well as any other combination of non-orthogonal methods with a statistically significant margin.","1063-6773;10636773","Electronic:978-1-4577-0664-6; POD:978-1-4577-0663-9","10.1109/ICSM.2011.6080780","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6080780","","Accuracy;Measurement;Unified modeling language;Vocabulary","information retrieval;probability;software engineering","RTM;VSM;complementary traceability links;orthogonal information retrieval;probabilistic Jensen and Shannon model;relational topic modeling;software artifacts;traceability recovery;vector space model","","31","","37","","","25-30 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The collective knowledge expressed though user-annotated data has a big potential, but needs to be filtered in a digest form so that the search result better reflects the users' preferences and actual aims. Starting from these considerations, our work presents an agent-based approach for a scalable semi-automatic generation of annotation tags, personalized on each user's preferences and tastes.

The efficiency of the -based “emotional” filters was justified through an extensive classification process, using higher-order crossings and cross-correlation as feature-vector extraction techniques and a support vector machine classifier for six different classification scenarios in the valence/arousal space. This resulted in mean classification rates from 64.17% up to 82.91% in a user-independent base, revealing the potential of establishing such a filtering for reliable EEG-based emotion recognition systems.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2012.2187647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151844","Electroencephalogram (EEG);emotion recognition (ER);empirical mode decomposition;frontal brain asymmetry;multidimensional directed information","Correlation;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Indexes;Time frequency analysis;Time series analysis","electroencephalography;emotion recognition;medical signal processing;signal classification;support vector machines;time-frequency analysis","EEG based emotion recognition systems;EEG recordings;EEG signals;adaptive emotional information retrieval;asymmetry index criterion;classification process;electroencephalogram signal;emotion related information;emotional filters;emotional reaction;empirical mode decomposition domain;feature vector extraction techniques;frontal brain asymmetry;multidimensional directed information analysis;support vector machine classifier;time-frequency domain EEG signal segmentation;valence-arousal space","","13","","34","","20120213","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In current web sites and data bases of sequences there are, usually, a set of paper references linked to each sequence. Those links are very useful because the papers describe useful information concerning the sequences. They are, therefore, a good starting point to look for relevant information related to a set of sequences. One way is to implement such approach is to do a blast with the new decoded sequences, and collect similar sequences. Then one looks at the papers linked with the similar sequences. Most often the number of retrieved papers is small and one has to search large data bases for relevant papers. In this paper we propose a process of generating a classifier based on the initially set of relevant papers that are directly linked to the similar sequences retrieved and use that classifier to automatically enlarge the set of relevant papers by searching the MEDLINE using the automatically constructed classifier.

Different from other approaches or models which consider aspects on word level, our approach assumes that aspects should be identified by the topics of retrieved documents. We present LDA model to discover topic distribution of retrieval passages and word distribution of each topic dimension, and then re-rank retrieval results with topic distribution similarity between passages based on JV-size slide window. Experiments on TREC 2007 Genomics collection and two distinctive IR baseline runs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in promoting ranking diversity for biomedical information retrieval. Evaluation results show that our approach can achieve 8% improvement over the highest Aspect MAP reported in TREC 2007 Genomics track.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4574-5; POD:978-1-4577-1799-4","10.1109/BIBM.2011.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120485","LDA;biomedical IR;ranking diversity","Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Educational institutions;Genomics;Information retrieval","information retrieval;medical computing;statistics","IR baseline;JV-size slide window;LDA model;TREC 2007 Genomics collection;biomedical information retrieval;latent Dirichlet allocation;ranking diversity promotion;retrieval passage topic distribution;topic dimension word distribution;topic generative model;word level","","1","","20","","","12-15 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The present day mobile phones can run rich stand alone applications as well as distributed client-server applications that access information via a web gateway. This changed environment brings new opportunities as well as constraints for mobile application developers. A move towards open source software offers several advantages for application developers and operating system vendors. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how voice enabled mobile applications can be deployed economically using only open source software to access information from the Web. Swar-Suchak is a voice enabled mobile application for information retrieval in multiple languages. We describe two applications running on Swar-Suchak using the open source Android platform.

Huser","Department of Cybernetics, FEE CTU in Prague, Czech Republic","2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing","20111201","2011","","","421","426","In this work we have studied, evaluated and proposed different swarm intelligence techniques for mining information from loosely structured medical textual records with no apriori knowledge. In the paper we depict the process of mining a large dataset of ~50,000-120,000 records × 20 attributes in database tables, originating from the hospital information system (thanks go to the University Hospital in Brno, Czech Republic) recording over 10 years. This paper concerns only textual attributes with free text input, that means 613,000 text fields in 16 attributes. Each attribute item contains ~800-1,500 characters (diagnoses, medications, etc.). The output of this task is a set of ordered/nominal attributes suitable for rule discovery mining and automated processing. Information mining from textual data becomes a very challenging task when the structure of the text record is very loose without any rules. The task becomes even more difficult when natural language is used and no apriori knowledge is available. The medical environment itself is also very specific: the natural language used in textual description varies with the personality creating the record (there are many personalized approaches), however it is restricted by terminology (i.e. medical terms, medical standards, etc.). Moreover, the typical patient record is filled with typographical errors, duplicates, ambiguities and many (nonstandard) abbreviations. Nature inspired methods have their origin in real nature processes and play an important role in the domain of artificial intelligence. They offer fast and robust solutions to many problems, although they belong to the branch of approximative methods. The high number of individuals and the decentralized approach to task coordination in the social species revealed a high degree of parallelism, self-organization and fault tolerance. In studying these paradigms, we have high chance to discover inspiration concepts for many successful metaheuristics. Fir- - st, classical approaches such as basic statistic approaches, word (and word sequence) frequency analysis, etc., have been used to simplify the textual data and provide a preliminary overview of the data. Finally, an ant-inspired self-organizing approach has been used to automatically provide a simplified dominant structure, presenting structure of the records in the human readable form that can be further utilized in the mining process as it describes the vast majority of the records. Note that this project is an ongoing process (and research) and new data are irregularly received from the medical facility, justifying the need for robust and fool-proof algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1124-4; POD:978-1-4577-1122-0","10.1109/NaBIC.2011.6089470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6089470","Ant Colony;Hospital Information SystemS;Hospital Information Systemwarm Intelligence;Medical Record Processing;Textual Data Mining;warm Intelligence","Clustering algorithms;Computers;Data mining;Heuristic algorithms;Hospitals;Insects;Medical diagnostic imaging","ant colony optimisation;data mining;fault tolerance;hospitals;information retrieval;medical information systems;natural language processing;particle swarm optimisation;records management","ant inspired techniques;ant-inspired self-organizing approach;artificial intelligence;decentralized approach;fault tolerance;fool-proof algorithms;hospital information system;information mining;natural language processing;nature inspired methods;patient record processing;rule discovery mining;swarm intelligence techniques;textual data mining;textual information retrieval","","4","","19","","","19-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the question remains -- does finding this single method enable the location of a complete set of affected methods? Previous arguments assume this to be true, however, few analyses of this assumption have been performed. In this paper, we perform a case study to test the reliability of this ""gold standard"" assumption.

Nowadays systems are expected to return results that are relevant to the intended meaning of the query. In the general IRS usage scenario, the user is not really interested if the returned documents contain or not the words he entered in the query, but the user expects the returned documents to be relevant to the intended meaning of his query. The subject of analyzing the query (expressed as a sentence in natural language) in order to infer the meaning of the query, has spawned lots of research publications in the last 10 years, but without any large impact in the user search experience. We propose a system (the OntoSense User Interface) that guides the user in providing the query directly as a query ontology, thus providing the meaning of the query directly to the IRS. This approach is especially useful in mobile platform information retrieval scenarios where the query sentence is usually too short (very few words are used) for the IRS to match relevant documents.","2324-7002;23247002","Electronic:978-89-88678-61-9; POD:978-1-4577-1128-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061537","","Correlation;Engines;Indexing;Information retrieval;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Semantics","document handling;information retrieval systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;user interfaces","OntoSense user interface;document matching;information retrieval systems;natural language;query ontology;query sentence","","0","","12","","","26-28 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to satisfy the needs of the user, an improvement to the search engine called Intelligent Cluster Search Engine (ICSE) has been proposed. The improvement of information retrieval process can be divided into two parts such as: comparison of co-occurrence terms and clustering of documents. In this information retrieval, the relevancy of documents is obtained based on the number of occurrences of each co-occurrent term (in links and out links) in a particular web page. The clustering of these relevant documents can be done based on the threshold values assigning to cluster and then the web pages are grouped into that cluster. When the web pages are clustered, a boost up factor is given to a web page based on the relevancy of content from title and summary. The documents can be classified into most relevant, relevant and irrelevant clusters. K-Means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the relevant web pages in order to increase the relevance rate of search results and reduce the computational time of the user.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0590-8; POD:978-1-4577-0588-5","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972402","Clustering;Information extraction;Information retrieval;K-Means algorithm","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Search engines;Web pages","Internet;document handling;information retrieval;pattern clustering;search engines","Internet technologies;Web pages;document clustering;information retrieval;intelligent cluster search engine;link based k-means clustering algorithm;link based search engine","","2","","8","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently various soft computing techniques have been used to improve information retrieval efficiency. More specifically genetic algorithms have been used for various information retrieval components like matching function learning, documents clustering, information extraction, query optimization [1 - 6]. In most of the cases in information retrieval matching function is based on term frequency. But the problem with this approach is that the syntactic information of the text document is lost and phrases are also not considered, so results in poor accuracy. In this paper we have proposed a new semantic based similarity measure in which each term can be a phrase or a single word and the weight assigned to each term is based on its semantic importance considering each sentence. We have used this semantic similarity measure along with other standard similarity measure as Jaccard and cosine to form the semantic-based-combined-similarity-measure.

To achieve this we use a Geoparsing Web Service to extract geographic coordinates from the online covers. Once geographic coordinates are extracted by using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) we draw the geo-positions and link the documents into a map image in order to visualize the places and the news concerning each place. It is possible, also, to search the title of the news according to a concept selected by the user.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1127-5; POD:978-1-4577-1125-1","10.1109/NWeSP.2011.6088145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088145","Geoparsing Web Services;georeferencing;information extraction;visualization of Semantic Web","Cities and towns;Geospatial analysis;Next generation networking;Semantics;Visualization;Web services;Web sites","Web services;data visualisation;information retrieval;publishing","ABC newspaper;AD newspaper;Asahi newspaper;Dagens Hyheter newspaper;El Comercio newspaper;Geoparsing Web Service;Gulf News newspaper;Haaretx newspaper;Haberturk newspaper;Il Giornale newspaper;Irish Examiner newspaper;Jornal de Noticias newspaper;La Razon newspaper;Le Monde newspaper;Morgen newspaper;New York Times newspaper;Reforma newspaper;Sydney Morning Herald newspaper;Tages Anzeiger newspaper;Telegraph newspaper;The Mercury newspaper;The Times newspaper;The Times of India newspaper;extensible markup language;geographic place visualization;information retrieval;map image;online newspaper;world projection","","0","","15","","","19-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With a ratio close to zero, the evaluation of a model-classifier-combination's generalization ability with leave-n-out-methods or cross-validation becomes unreliable: The generalization error of a complex model (with a more complex hypothesis structure) might underestimated compared to the generalization error of a simple model (with a less complex hypothesis structure). Given this situation, optimizing the bias-variance-tradeoff to select among these models will lead one astray. To address this problem we introduce the idea of robust models, where one intentionally restricts the hypothesis structure within the model formation process. We observe that -- despite the fact that such a robust model entails a higher test error -- its efficiency ""in the wild"" outperforms the model that would have been chosen normally, under the perspective of the best bias-variance-tradeoff. We present two case studies: (1) a categorization task, which demonstrates that robust models are more stable in retrieval situations when training data is scarce, and (2) a genre identification task, which underlines the practical relevance of robust models.","1529-4188;15294188","Electronic:978-0-7695-4486-1; POD:978-1-4577-0982-1","10.1109/DEXA.2011.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059815","bias;machine learning;overfitting;retrieval model","Accuracy;Analytical models;Machine learning;Robustness;Training;Vocabulary","classification;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","bias-variance-tradeoff;classification tasks;document collections;generalization error;information retrieval;learning process;robust models","","1","","27","","","Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of the retrieval is to provide the end users with as relevant results as possible. Many research efforts have been done to build ranking models for different semantic concepts (or classes). While some of them have been proven to be effective, others are still far from satisfactory. Our observation that certain target semantic concepts have high co-occurrence relationships with those easy-to-retrieve semantic concepts (or called reference semantics) has motivated us to utilize such co-occurrence relationships between semantic concepts in information retrieval and re-ranking. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic retrieval and re-ranking framework that takes advantage of the co-occurrence relationships between a target semantic concept and a reference semantic concept to re-rank the retrieved results. The proposed framework discretizes the training data into a set of feature-value pairs and employs Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to capture the correlation in terms of the impact weight between feature-value pairs and the positive-positive class in which the data instances belong to both the target semantic concept and the reference semantic concept. A combination of all these impact weights is utilized to re-rank the retrieved results for the target semantic concept. Comparative experiments are designed and evaluated on TRECVID 2005 and TRECVID 2010 video collections with public-available ranking scores. Experimental results on different retrieval scales demonstrate that our proposed framework can enhance the retrieval results for the target semantic concepts in terms of average precision, and the improvements for some semantic concepts are promising.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4589-9; POD:978-1-4577-2015-4","10.1109/ISM.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6123325","Co-occurrence Relationship;Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA);Re-ranking;Semantic Information Retrieval","Correlation;Equations;Mathematical model;Roads;Semantics;Training data;Vectors","information retrieval;multimedia computing","TRECVID 2005 video collection;TRECVID 2010 video collection;cooccurrence relationship utilization;information retrieval reranking;multimedia;multiple correspondence analysis;public-available ranking scores;reference semantic concept;semantic concepts;semantic information retrieval;target semantic concept","","4","","28","","","5-7 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous researches focus on applying traditional information retrieval (IR) techniques to GIR, such as ranking geographic relevance by vector space model (VSM). In many cases, these keyword-based methods can not support spatial query very well. For example, searching documents on “debris flow took place in Hunan last year”, the documents selected in this way may only contain the words “debris flow” and “Hunan” rather than refer to “debris flow actually occurred in Hunan”. Lack of spatial relations between thematic activates (debris flow) and geographic entities (Hunan) is the key reason for this problem. In this paper, we present a kernel-based approach and apply it in support vector machine (SVM) to extract spatial relations from free text for further GIS service and spatial reasoning. First, we analyze the characters of spatial relation expressions in natural language and there are two types of spatial relations: topology and direction. Both of them are used to qualitatively describe the relative positions of spatial objects to each other. Then we explore the use of dependency tree (a dependency tree represents the grammatical dependencies in a sentence and it can be generated by syntax parser) to identify these spatial relations. We observe that the features required to find a relationship between two spatial named entities in the same sentence is typically captured by the shortest path between the two entities in the dependency tree. Therefore, we construct a shortest path dependency kernel for SVM to complete the task. The experiment results show that our dependency tree kernel achieves significant improvement than previous method.","2161-024X;2161024X","Electronic:978-1-61284-848-8; POD:978-1-61284-849-5","10.1109/GeoInformatics.2011.5980797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5980797","Dependency tree;Geographic information retrieval;Kernel function;Spatial relations;Support vector machine","Data mining;Feature extraction;Kernel;Natural languages;Rivers;Support vector machines;Syntactics","geographic information systems;inference mechanisms;information retrieval;natural language processing;support vector machines;text analysis;topology;trees (mathematics)","GIS service;SVM;Web documents;dependency tree kernel;geographic information retrieval;natural language;shortest path dependency kernel;spatial reasoning;spatial relation expression;spatial relations;support vector machine;syntax parser;unstructured text","","2","","19","","","24-26 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this proposed system, we have implemented an approach that provides daily information retrieved from Internet, where users can operate this system with his hands' movements. Once selected the function by hand gestures, the system will report action information to users by synthetized speech. In a typical family, since each member has different requirements and needs, the system utilizes face recognition to identify each user, bringing up personalized services to each user. In this paper, we use PCA method to recognize faces as also hand gestures, and then a number of hand gestures and system controls are acquired and stored into this system.

Unfortunately, the traditional key words matching method has been useless. Therefore, how to retrieve the expected results in semantic level has become a tough challenge for information retrieval. Theoretically, many methods have been proposed to solve it, among which latent semantic analysis (LSA) model is the most famous one. However, while conventional LSA methods, for example singular value decomposition (SVD), do make advances in this issue, they consume large memory and generate elements with negative value in some dimensions, which is meaningless. With such consideration, in this paper, we propose a content-based retrieval model using non-negative matrix factorization method, which generates a latent semantic space representation with non-negative parts as a low rank approximation to term-document matrix. Experimental results show that our approach gets a good performance in content-based retrieval.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6581-1; POD:978-1-4244-6579-8","10.1109/ICMSS.2011.5999091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999091","","Computational modeling;Encoding;Information retrieval;Matrix decomposition;Patents;Semantics","content-based retrieval;document handling;singular value decomposition","content-based information retrieval model;key words matching method;latent semantic analysis model;latent semantic space representation;low rank approximation;mass information;nonnegative matrix factorization method;semantic level;singular value decomposition;term-document matrix","","0","","6","","","12-14 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The task becomes all the more difficult if the process involves recovery of fuzzy data. Then, not only does the text comparison between query and document become sufficient, but at the same time concept matching also assumes importance. Our primary aim in this paper is to work out a data extracting system that can handle queries and documents involving fuzzy concepts along with crisp concepts. Here, the keywords from query and document are matched keeping an eye on the meaning of the words. Moreover, the ontology used here is created by treating fuzzy linguistic terms as variables called fuzzy-valued variables, a completely new way of dealing with fuzzy concepts. In our research, we have considered a linguistic variable (a fuzzy set) as a fuzzy-valued variable. We have taken a layered approach and given emphasis on modularity. We take the concerned linguistic variable to sit at the root of a tree with the semantically similar terms situated at the end of the branches of the tree and through this process the meaning of the term is reflected.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1196-1; POD:978-1-4577-1195-4","10.1109/SoCPaR.2011.6089090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6089090","NLP;data retrieval;fuzzy set;fuzzy-valued variable;ontology","Humans;Ontologies;Pattern recognition;Pragmatics;Search methods;Vegetation","document handling;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","data extracting system;document retrieval;fuzzy data;fuzzy information retrieval;fuzzy valued variable concept;linguistic variable;ontology generation","","0","","9","","","14-16 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The MIR research aims to develop new techniques for processing musical information and searching music databases by content. Therefore, robust retrieval and matching techniques are required. This paper devises a more practical and efficient approach to MIR by investigating a variety of statistical and signal processing-based features, such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Linear Predicative Coding coefficients LPC, Pitch and the wavelet analysis. The features were tested by using different measures of melodic similarity to achieve a better search in musical databases. The paper uses the recall measure to evaluate the retrieval results. It indicated a poor retrieval quality with statistical features and LPC parameters and it is improved when we used the FFT coefficients, and finally using wavelet coefficients caused a significant improvement in its value.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0128-3; POD:978-1-4577-0127-6","10.1109/ICCES.2011.6141048","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141048","Multimedia;Music;Retrieval;Wavelets","Chebyshev approximation;Databases;Feature extraction;Noise measurement;Time frequency analysis","audio databases;fast Fourier transforms;information retrieval;music;statistical analysis;wavelet transforms","fast Fourier transform;feature selection;linear predicative coding coefficients;matching technique;melodic similarity;music database;musical information retrieval;pitch analysis;recall measure;statistical feature;wavelet analysis","","0","","27","","","Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is abundant research and experimentation done over Western music. However, moderate amount of work noticed over Indian music and its related fields such as computational musicology and artificial intelligence to the realm of Indian music [1]. On the other hand, Indian music has adequate history and slowly it is becoming an international phenomenon. This has opened a wide opportunity for an Indian music discovery system which can suggest music based either on known artists or on simple descriptive terms. Hence researchers from various domains such as music processing, computer engineering and artificial intelligence etc. are contributing more towards Indian music processing. Eventually Indian music is broadly classified into South Indian Carnatic music and North Indian Hindustani music. Both the systems of music are rich in their own style and Carnatic music is much more complex in the way the notes are arranged and rendered [11]. Apart from these two broader categories, there are various types of Indian music. They are folk, tribal, bhajans or devotional, bhangra, Indi-pop, film songs, fusion and ghazals. This paper presents an overview of previous works on automatic Indian music information recognition, classification and retrieval.

However, service changes may affect service compositions that are currently consuming the services. Hence, audit testing (a form of regression testing in charge of checking for compatibility issues) is needed. As service compositions are often in continuous operation and the external services have limited (expensive) access when invoked for testing, audit testing has severe time and resources constraints, which make test prioritization a crucial technique (only the highest priority test cases will be executed).This paper presents a novel approach to the prioritization of audit test cases using information retrieval. This approach matches a service change description with the code portions exercised by the relevant test cases. So, test cases are prioritized based on their relevance to the service change.

However, the difference between humming phrase matching and the precision of singer humming increase the difficulty of retrieval. Apart from retrieval precision, retrieval time is another issue should be taken into consideration. In this paper, we use two-stage searching approach for music retrieval. Since PAT tree (variant of Patricia tree, practical algorithm to retrieve information coded in alphanumeric) shows an excellent performance in matching partial sequence, in the first stage, the simply reduced note interval is adopted as a key phrase of PAT tree for fast indexing the candidate regions from the feature sequences in the database. In addition, the searching of partial sequences suffering from the insertion, deletion and transposition errors works well in the indexing of reduced note interval. The resulting diversity of candidates may be further reduced via a more complicated dynamic time warping (DTW) comparison in the second step.

Software exists that can detect the pitch of a signal emitted from a musical instrument, but this is insufficient for guitar tablature which also requires spatial information. Previous vision-based methods had low accuracy rates and required the camera to be fixed to the guitar neck. In this paper we propose an algorithm that uses a markerless approach to successfully locate a guitar fretboard in a webcam image, normalise it and detect the individual locations of the guitarist's fretting fingers. Preliminary testing of this system shows that it is more accurate at note recognition than existing methods which require a camera mounted on the guitar neck.","2151-2191;21512191","Electronic:978-1-4244-9631-0; POD:978-1-4244-9629-7","10.1109/IVCNZ.2010.6148852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6148852","automatic transcription;computer vision;guitar","Algorithm design and analysis;Cameras;Computer vision;Equations;Image edge detection;Neck;Transforms","computer vision;image recognition;image retrieval;music;musical instruments","computer vision;guitar fretboard;guitar neck;guitar tablature;guitarist fingering information retrieval;markerless approach;musical instrument;musical notation writing;note recognition;webcam image","","1","","14","","","8-9 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most popular consists in expanding the query with related terms with the goal of retrieving more relevant documents. In this paper, we propose a new method in which a Cell Assembly model is applied for query expansion. Cell Assemblies are reverberating circuits of neurons that can persist long beyond the initial stimulus has ceased. They learn through Hebbian Learning rules and have been used to simulate the formation and the usage of human concepts. We adapted the Cell Assembly model to learn relationships between the terms in a document collection. These relationships are then used to augment the original queries.

We focused on analysing the implementation of query expansion, word sense disambiguation (WSD), iterated relevance feedback, and some retrieval variations to retrieval performance. In this paper, WSD is implemented in Lucene using query expansion with thesaurus and relevance feedback. Extended Lesk algorithm was re-implemented to disambiguate the query using WordNet. Expansion terms were limited up to 20 words chosen from expansion term candidates from disambiguated query's senses information, co-occurrence terms, and most frequent terms using Kullback-Leibler Distance. We iterated the process to find the best number of expansion iteration. We found that the method using WSD to query can extend search process time to 161 times longer at worst. Query expansion using disambiguated sense information did not affect the performance much while using information from relevance feedback did.

In recent years, the daily usage of several different types and amounts of data has made it difficult to locate and retrieve archived files. When we want to access locate files or e-mail messages, we are required to remember the relevant filenames, the date of creation, or the extension of the file. However, it is troublesome to remember information. Therefore, we propose a method to use the location and transportation information (Where) for a retrieval system. Even if a user cannot remember the filename, date, extension of the file, etc., of the required file, he can use his location during file creation as a search parameter. Our system records the GPS user's position data and the history of his actions (editing /saving files) on the device. This recorded data is used by the system to show search results for the location of the user during file creation as a criteria. Our system uses the principle of the Five W's and One H and several other ideas to identify the user location from the GPS data. We conducted an experiment to confirm whether or not our tools were useful. Experimental results showed that our tools enabled the retrieval system to accurately identify various user locations and a user could locate the required target file efficiently and rapidly.","2159-3442;21593442","Electronic:978-1-4577-0255-6; POD:978-1-4577-0256-3","10.1109/TENCON.2011.6129096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6129096","GPS;Retrieval system;support system;transportation mode;user location","Buildings;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Global Positioning System;Legged locomotion;Satellites;Transportation","Global Positioning System;electronic mail;information retrieval systems","GPS;e-mail messages;information retrieval system;location information;transportation information","","0","1","6","","","21-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional models represent webpages by using the frequency of terms or the structure of links in order to assign weight to terms of webpages. This paper presents a semantic information retrieval to represent specific websites. This proposal integrates text mining algorithms based on natural language processing and traditional representation models with the aim to improve the quality of webpages recovered by searching. Each webpage of the website is represented as a vector of topics, instead of a vector of terms. In a similar way, the query is represented as a vector of topics.
