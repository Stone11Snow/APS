Since training corpora sizes are relatively small - compared to ap infin what would be required for a realistic number of words - the generalization power of the learning algorithms is low. It is assumed that a bigger text corpus can boost the representation and hence the learning process. Based on the work of Gabrilovich and Markovitch [6], we incorporate Wikipedia articles into the system to give word distributional representation for documents. The extension with this new corpus causes dimensionality increase, therefore clustering of features is needed.

Nevertheless, inter-vehicle communications require solving the problem of message routing, where the location of the destination node is unknown due to node mobility and lack of adequate infrastructure. Hence, the problem of finding the location of the destination node (node localization) becomes very complex. One of the most recent solution approaches for node localization in VANET is to use location service management protocols. However, major impediments in leveraging such promising solutions include the large volume of signaling overhead which results from the increase in the number of vehicles and/or the non-local communication traffic in the network. In this paper, a region-based location service management protocol (RLSMP) is proposed. This protocol is a self-organizing framework, which uses message aggregation enhanced by geographical clustering to minimize the volume of the signaling overhead. RLSMP is the first protocol that uses message aggregation in querying, and promises scalability, locality awareness, minimum signaling overhead and maximum channel utilization.","2166-0077;21660077","POD:978-1-4244-2024-7","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2007.4437821","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4437821","Location service management;geographical clustering;message aggregation","Ad hoc networks;Automotive engineering;Costs;Design engineering;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Network servers;Protocols;Systems engineering and theory;Vehicles","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;mobility management (mobile radio);protocols;telecommunication services","VANET;channel utilization;geographical clustering;location-based message aggregation;message routing;node localization;region-based location service management protocol;signaling overhead;vehicular ad hoc networks","","14","","16","","","26-30 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an innovative method for semantic video annotation through integrated mining of visual features, speech features, and frequent semantic patterns existing in the video. The proposed method mainly consists of two main phases: 1) Construction of four kinds of predictive annotation models, namely speech-association, visual-association, visual-sequential, and statistical models from annotated videos. 2) Fusion of these models for annotating un-annotated videos automatically. The main advantage of the proposed method lies in that all visual features, speech features, and semantic patterns are considered simultaneously. Moreover, the utilization of high-level rules can effectively complement the insufficiency of statistics-based methods in dealing with complex and broad keyword identification in video annotation. Through empirical evaluation on NIST TRECVID video datasets, the proposed approach is shown to enhance the performance of annotation substantially in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2007.911832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432628","Association rule;data mining;frequent semantic patterns;sequential patterns;video annotation","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Image retrieval;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;NIST;Pattern analysis;Predictive models;Speech analysis","data mining;feature extraction;information retrieval;multimedia communication;speech processing;statistical analysis;video signal processing","frequent semantic pattern;integrated mining;keyword identification;multimedia information retrieval;speech-association model;statistical model;video annotation;video content analysis;visual-association model;visual-sequential model","","26","","26","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we focus on the challenging issue of recognizing the emotion content of music signals, or music emotion recognition (MER). Specifically, we formulate MER as a regression problem to predict the arousal and valence values (AV values) of each music sample directly. Associated with the AV values, each music sample becomes a point in the arousal-valence plane, so the users can efficiently retrieve the music sample by specifying a desired point in the emotion plane. Because no categorical taxonomy is used, the regression approach is free of the ambiguity inherent to conventional categorical approaches. To improve the performance, we apply principal component analysis to reduce the correlation between arousal and valence, and RReliefF to select important features. An extensive performance study is conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the regression approach for predicting AV values. The best performance evaluated in terms of the <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> statistics reaches 58.3% for arousal and 28.1% for valence by employing support vector machine as the regressor. We also apply the regression approach to detect the emotion variation within a music selection and find the prediction accuracy superior to existing works. A group-wise MER scheme is also developed to address the subjectivity issue of emotion perception.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2007.911513","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432654","Arousal;music emotion recognition (MER);regression;support vector machine;valence","Accuracy;Content based retrieval;Emotion recognition;Explosions;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Principal component analysis;Statistics;Support vector machines;Taxonomy","content-based retrieval;emotion recognition;feature extraction;music;principal component analysis;regression analysis;signal sampling;support vector machines","MER;arousal-valence plane;content-based retrieval;feature selection;music emotion recognition;music signal sampling;principal component analysis;regression approach;support vector machine","","120","","35","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In establishing database, quantization technique is applied to quantize the feature vector of each database image, such that the feature space is partitioned into a finite number of grids, each of which corresponds to a grid code (GC). On querying an image, a reduced set of candidate images which have the same GC (or adjacent GCs) as that of the query image is obtained.

SNEP is modelled in two scenarios using the high-level formal language HLPSL, and verified using the model checking tool Avispa, where two main security properties are checked: authenticity and confidentiality of relevant messages components. The first case is the communication between the base station and networks nodes in order to retrieve node confidential information. The second case is a key distribution protocol in a sensor network using SNEP for securing messages. As a result of this analysis, one attack have been found: a false request message from an intruder. In that case, the intruder impersonates the base station and creates false requests. This way, the intruder may obtain confidential data from a node in the network.

The relevance between a query image and any database image is ranked according to a similar measure computed from the selected regions between two images.

This paper proposes a semantic user model integrated into a Web personalization system which that is based on an expressive description logic language. The user model employs both static and dynamic user information to predict user features relevant to a given application domain. The logic-based user-modeling framework acts as a support for a semantic Web personalization system to tailor information services to the user. Our user-modeling approach is exemplarily applied to the tourism domain, to describe user information and identify user's classification.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-2859-7; POD:0-7695-2859-7","10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2007.109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4437938","description logics.;semantic user model;user ontology;web personalization","Automation;Computer science;Context modeling;Information retrieval;Kernel;Logic;Ontologies;Predictive models;Semantic Web;User interfaces","Internet;knowledge based systems;semantic Web;user interfaces","Web personalization;description logic language;human-computer interactions;kernel role;knowledge-based user interface environment;logic-based user-modeling framework;semantic user model","","1","","21","","","19-25 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our VRS has two special aspects compared with previous bookmark systems. First, we adopt the robust audio fingerprint feature of long-term logarithmic modified DCT modulation coefficients (LMDCT-MC) for audio indexing and retrieval. Second, we propose and apply a two-stage search (TSS) algorithm for fast searching. In the first stage of TSS, candidate video segments are roughly determined with audio index bit vectors (IBV) and then the optimal video clip is obtained by fingerprint bit vectors (FBV). We evaluate the proposed system with a database of 100 TV programs including news, panel discussions, music shows, advertisements, and dramas. The experimental results show that our VRS achieve fast search, robustness to noise and high precision of retrieval.

Traditionally, the analysis of music expression is based on measurements of the deviations of the acoustic parameters with respect to the written score. In this paper, we employ machine learning techniques to understand the expressive communication and to derive audio features at an intermediate level, between music intended as a structured language and notes intended as sound at a more physical level. We start by extracting audio features from expressive performances that were recorded by asking the musicians to perform in order to convey different expressive intentions. We use a sequential forward selection procedure to rank and select a set of features for a general description of the expressions, and a second one specific for each instrument. We show that higher recognition ratings are achieved by using a set of four features which can be specifically related to qualitative descriptions of the sound by physical metaphors. These audio features can be used to retrieve expressive content on audio data, and to design the next generation of search engines for music information retrieval.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2007.913743","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432649","Audio classification;expression communication;music understanding","Acoustic measurements;Content based retrieval;Emotion recognition;Humans;Machine learning;Music information retrieval;Performance analysis;Search engines;Timbre;Timing","audio signal processing;database indexing;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);music","audio feature extraction;expressive communication;machine learning techniques;music expression;physical metaphors;score-independent audio features;sequential forward selection procedure;structured language","","15","","34","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Field spectral measurements were collected over corn and wheat canopies in different intensive field campaigns organized during the growing seasons of 2004 and 2005. They were used to test and evaluate several combined indices for chlorophyll determination using hyperspectral imagery (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager). Several index combinations were investigated using both PROSPECT-SAILH canopy simulated spectra and field-measured reflectances. The relationships between leaf chlorophyll content and combined optical indices have shown similar trends for both PROSPECT-SAILH simulated data and ground-measured data sets, which indicates that both spectral measurements and radiative transfer models hold comparable potential for the quantitative retrieval of crop foliar pigments. The data set used has shown that crop type had a clear influence on the establishment of predictive equations as well as on their validation. In addition to generating different predictive equations, corn and wheat data yielded contrasting agreement between estimated and measured chlorophyll contents even for the same predictive algorithm. Among the set of indices tested in this paper, index combinations like modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), triangular chlorophyll index/OSAVI, moderate resolution imaging spectrometer terrestrial chlorophyll index/improved soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), and red-edge model/MSAVI seem to be relatively consistent and more stable as estimators of crop chlorophyll content.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.904836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414349","Chlorophyll content;chlorophyll estimation;combined indices;crop-type effect;hyperspectral;leaf area index (LAI);precision agriculture","Content based retrieval;Crops;Differential equations;Hyperspectral imaging;Information retrieval;Pigments;Reflectivity;Testing;Vegetation mapping;Yield estimation","atmospheric boundary layer;crops;radiative transfer;remote sensing","AD 2004 to 2005;Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager;Improved Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index;MSAVI;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index;Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index;OSAVI;Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index;PROSPECT-SAILH canopy simulated spectra;Red-Edge Model;Triangular Chlorophyll Index;canopy reflectance;corn canopy;crop foliar pigments;crop type;hyperspectral imagery;leaf chlorophyll content;optical indices;radiative transfer models;remote estimation;wheat canopy","","68","5","60","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we investigate the use of information from relevant documents retrieved from a contemporary text collection for each sentence of a spoken document to be summarized in a probabilistic generative framework for extractive spoken document summarization. In the proposed methods, the probability of a document being generated by a sentence is modeled by a hidden Markov model (HMM), while the retrieved relevant text documents are used to estimate the HMM's parameters and the sentence's prior probability. The results of experiments on Chinese broadcast news compiled in Taiwan show that the new methods outperform the previous HMM approach.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1746-9; POD:978-1-4244-1745-2","10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4430107","extractive summarization;hidden Markov model;probabilistic generative model;relevance model;relevant document;spoken document;summarization","Data mining;Hidden Markov models;Information resources;Information retrieval;Information science;Multimedia communication;Parameter estimation;Speech;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","hidden Markov models;information retrieval;probability;speech processing;text analysis","contemporary text collection;extractive summarization;hidden Markov model;indicative sentences;information retrieval;probabilistic generative model;spoken document summarization;text document","","1","","20","","","9-13 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though recent identification algorithms show a significant degree of robustness towards noise, MP3 compression artifacts, and uniform temporal distortions, the notion of similarity is rather close to the identity. In this paper, we address a higher level retrieval problem, which we refer to as audio matching: given a short query audio clip, the goal is to automatically retrieve all excerpts from all recordings within the database that musically correspond to the query. In our matching scenario, opposed to classical audio identification, we allow semantically motivated variations as they typically occur in different interpretations of a piece of music. To this end, this paper presents an efficient and robust audio matching procedure that works even in the presence of significant variations, such as nonlinear temporal, dynamical, and spectral deviations, where existing algorithms for audio identification would fail. Furthermore, the combination of various deformation- and fault-tolerance mechanisms allows us to employ standard indexing techniques to obtain an efficient, index-based matching procedure, thus providing an important step towards semantically searching large-scale real-world music collections.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2007.911552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432645","Audio indexing;audio matching;chroma features;music retrieval;musical interpretation;work identification","Audio databases;Audio recording;Digital audio players;Fault tolerance;Indexing;Large-scale systems;Music information retrieval;Noise robustness;Nonlinear distortion;Signal processing algorithms","audio databases;audio recording;audio signal processing;database indexing;information retrieval","audio database;audio identification;audio indexing;audio matching;chroma features;music interpretation;music recordings;music retrieval;spectral deviations;work identification","","31","2","38","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This hybrid approach overcomes the conventional tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and variety of recommended artists. Collaborative filtering, which is used on e-commerce sites, cannot recommend nonbrated pieces and provides a narrow variety of artists. Content-based filtering does not have satisfactory accuracy because it is based on the heuristics that the user's favorite pieces will have similar musical content despite there being exceptions. To attain a higher recommendation accuracy along with a wider variety of artists, we use a probabilistic generative model that unifies the collaborative and content-based data in a principled way. This model can explain the generative mechanism of the observed data in the probability theory. The probability distribution over users, pieces, and features is decomposed into three conditionally independent ones by introducing latent variables. This decomposition enables us to efficiently and incrementally adapt the model for increasing numbers of users and rating scores. We evaluated our system by using audio signals of commercial CDs and their corresponding rating scores obtained from an e-commerce site. The results revealed that our system accurately recommended pieces including nonrated ones from a wide variety of artists and maintained a high degree of accuracy even when new users and rating scores were added.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2007.911503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432655","Aspect model;hybrid collaborative and content-based recommendation;incremental training;music recommender system;probabilistic generative model","Collaboration;Educational technology;Filtering;Hybrid power systems;Management training;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Probability distribution;Recommender systems;Signal generators","audio signal processing;content-based retrieval;music;statistical distributions","acoustic features;audio signals;collaborative data;content-based data;hybrid music recommender system;incrementally trainable probabilistic generative model;probability distribution;rating scores","","45","1","34","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this purpose, a DICOM interface has been developed for retrieving CT data from DICOM files and converting it into suitable format for making geometry.

A new approach to approximate subword posterior probability in a word lattice is also incorporated in PSPL/CN to handle OOV/rare word problems, which were unaddressed in original PSPL and CN approaches. Extensive experimental results on Chinese broadcast news segments indicate that PSPL offers higher accuracy than CN but requiring much larger disk space, while subword-based PSPL turns out to be very attractive because it lowers the storage cost while offers even higher accuracies.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1746-9; POD:978-1-4244-1745-2","10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430193","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4430193","PSPL;S-PSPL;Spoken Document Retrieval","Automatic speech recognition;Broadcasting;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Costs;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Internet;Lattices","indexing;information retrieval;speech recognition","Chinese broadcast news segments;confusion networks;position specific posterior lattices;retrieval accuracy;spoken document indexing;sub word units;subword posterior probability","","7","","15","","","9-13 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The principles and the practical implementations of Bayesian procedures and NNs are briefly discussed in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of each. Experimental tests are carried out by using the same set of training and test data for each method. The methodologies have been applied to two sets of data to retrieve SM from bare soils and to verify their accuracy. One data set contains scatterometer and radiometer data acquired on a variety of agricultural fields in different polarizations, frequencies, and incidence angles. The other is made up of five experiments carried out with a C-band scatterometer on rough and smooth soils at different polarizations and incidence angles. There are significant similarities in the performance of each method; they both retrieve the same features and trends in the analyzed data sets. Algorithm performances change according to SM level and data configuration. The main difficulties are found in retrieving low SM values, and in this case, the error on estimates is reduced when the data with two polarizations or two incidence angles are inserted in the inversion procedure. One major difference between the methodologies is that the NN performance improves, with respect to the Bayesian method, when more inputs are presented as two polarizations or two incidence angles in the training phase.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.909951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407741","Bayesian approach;inversion;neural networks (NNs);radar data;soil moisture (SM)","Bayesian methods;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Polarization;Radar measurements;Radiometry;Samarium;Soil moisture;Statistical analysis;Testing","Bayes methods;hydrology;neural nets;radiometers;remote sensing;soil","Bayesian method;C-band scatterometer;agricultural fields;neural network approach;radiometer;remote sensing;soil moisture retrieval","","26","","38","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Semantic verification with forward-backward propagation is applied to improve the precision of the retrieved documents. In the forward procedure, a bag of keywords is selected according to word significance measure. In the backward procedure, semantic relation between keywords is estimated for semantic verification. The verification score is then used to weight and re-rank the retrieved documents to improve the retrieval performance. Experiments were conducted on a collected broadcast news database of 198 hours.

Here, we propose a method to discover informative content block without supervision. Initially, using a set of sample pages, we adopt a series of rules to distinguish informative content blocks from clutters. Then we generalize public XPath for informative content blocks or clutters, and apply it to similar pages.

This letter describes a data-mining approach aimed to facilitate this highly labor-intensive process. It is based on training a neural network for retrieval and comparing its performance with that of the operational algorithm. The situations, where a neural network is more accurate, point to the weaknesses of the operational algorithm that could be corrected. Use of decision trees is proposed to provide easily interpretable descriptions of such situations. The approach was applied on 3646 collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and AERONET observations over the continental U.S. related to the retrieval of aerosol optical thickness.

For this purpose, polarimetric measurements acquired using the GB-SAR sensor developed at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya are employed. The heterogeneous environment of Collserola Park in the outskirts of Barcelona, Spain, was selected as the test area. Data sets were acquired at X-band during one week in June 2005. The effects of the atmosphere variations between successive zero-baseline SAR polarimetric acquisitions are treated here in detail. The need to compensate for the resulting phase-difference errors when retrieving interferometric information is put forward. A compensation technique is then proposed and evaluated using the control points placed inside the observed scene.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2007.908364","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383036","Differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR);GB-SAR sensor;polarimetric SAR (PolSAR);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Atmosphere;Atmospheric measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Information retrieval;Interferometry;Layout;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Synthetic aperture radar;Testing","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric pressure;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;radar interferometry;synthetic aperture radar","AD 2005 06;Barcelona;Collserola Park;Spain;Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya;atmosphere variations;atmospheric artifact compensation;atmospheric humidity;atmospheric pressure;atmospheric temperature;coherence-based technique;differential interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar;ground-Based DInSAR applications;heterogeneous environment;interferometric information;polarimetric measurements","","29","1","12","","","Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This continuous growth of information makes the Internet more and more interesting, but also the task of finding selected information becomes more complex and hard. Finding exactly what a user needs is not always an easy task: for example common search engines provide thousands of links for every search. Obviously not all these links are related to what the user really needs. In this paper, we present a collaborative autonomous interface agent (CAIA) that collaborates with the Internet search engines and supports the user in finding exactly the information consistent with his/her interest. A system has been designed, fully implemented and tested. The testing results shows a big improvement in the relevancy of the retrieved links and of the user's satisfaction by using CAIA+Google compared to using only Google.","","POD:0-7695-3028-1","10.1109/WI-IATW.2007.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4427621","Collaborative Autonomous Interface AgentInternet Search","Collaborative work;Conferences;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;International collaboration;Minerals;Petroleum;Search engines;Software agents;Web and internet services","Internet;groupware;information retrieval;search engines;software agents","CAIA+Google;Internet search engines;Web searching guide;autonomous interface agents collaboration;collaborative autonomous interface agent;user satisfaction","","1","","11","","","5-12 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A query expansion technique using class models is proposed and included in our framework. Finally, our method's impact on exact answer extraction is evaluated. We show that combining sentence LMs with document LMs significantly improves sentence retrieval performance, and that this sentence retrieval approach leads to better answer extraction performance.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1746-9; POD:978-1-4244-1745-2","10.1109/ASRU.2007.4430112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4430112","Language Modeling;Question Answering;Sentence Retrieval","Computer science;Context modeling;Data mining;Humans;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Redundancy;Seminars;Speech analysis;TV broadcasting","natural language processing","CLEF;cross language evaluation forum;language modeling approach;query expansion technique;speech transcripts","","0","","11","","","9-13 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users, therefore, are not equipped with expressive means to structurally and semantically describe their ontology needs. To tackle this problem, this paper develops a framework for Semantic Query based Ontology Retrieval, namely SQORE. It enables precise formulation of a semantic query in order to best capture ontology requirements of the user, which includes not only the desired class and property names, but also their relations and restrictions. SQORE employs XML Declarative Description (XDD) theory as its theoretical foundation for modeling ontology databases and evaluating semantic queries. Moreover, similarity score, query coverage score and compactness score are formally defined as metrics for ranking the resultant ontologies. Experimental results indicate that SQORE yields better results and better rankings, when compared to existing systems.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3007-9; POD:0-7695-3007-9","10.1109/SKG.2007.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438516","","Database languages;Engines;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Libraries;Mechanical factors;Ontologies;Semantic Web;System performance;XML","XML;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;semantic Web","SQORE;XML declarative description theory;keyword matching;knowledge reusability;ontology database modeling;semantic Web;semantic query based ontology retrieval;semantic query formulation","","0","","18","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
