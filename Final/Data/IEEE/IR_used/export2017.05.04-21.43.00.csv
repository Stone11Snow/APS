In this paper we consider a recently proposed lookup protocol that satisfies interesting efficiency properties by using an approach reminiscent of indirect-address storage techniques, and thus significantly different from other well-known flooding-type approaches. We observe that this protocol can be adapted to obtain a service discovery protocol in MANET. Specifically, we build an index system that matches services to their correspondent service agents; then servers register themselves to selected agents, and clients can efficiently retrieve the service information from the specific service agents. We then investigate the problem of securing the proposed protocol against Byzantine adversaries.

In this paper, based on a novel web image data model, i.e. Fine-Grained Web Image Model (FGWIM), a flexible and extensible framework for web image retrieval is proposed, which incorporates highlevel semantics and low-level visual features of Web images and supports the visual part of MPEG-7 standard. FGWIM model describes the web image data in several levels of abstraction by fine-grained and structured representation, and gives multiple choices at each level, which provides a good flexibility and extensibility for further feature extraction, similarity measurement, integration of semantic and visual features.

The technique combines one of the most effective retinex algorithm (McCann99) with the gray-world transformation applied at multiple resolutions. A non linear post processing step is also proposed that improves the final color balance and range. Extensive experimental tests have been performed both on synthetic and real images, that confirm the robustness and the enhanced color recovery capability with respect to other on the edge techniques.

A DPR inversion technique(DPR-IT) that focuses on the retrieval of DSD information from the non-Rayleigh backscattering characteristic of the hydrometeors and a conventional DPR technique(DPR-CT) that focuses on the independent retrieval of rainfall rate from the attenuation measurement are considered in this analysis. The preliminary results show that at different rainfall rate regions these methods have different responses to the DSD variability. For instance, it appears that DPR-IT suffers relatively less from the DSD variability in the regions of weak to moderate rainfall rate (<∼10<!-- Character ""/"" changed to / -->/ mm · h<sup>-1</sup>),while in the strong rainfall rate (>∼10 mm · h<sup>-1</sup>) region the DPR-CT generally has less sensitivity to DSD variations than the DPR-IT.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2005.862275","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1621078","Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR);Raindrop size distribution;rain retrieval accuracy","Attenuation measurement;Backscatter;Frequency;Information retrieval;Radar cross section;Radar measurements;Rain;Reflectivity;Size measurement;Spaceborne radar","atmospheric techniques;rain;remote sensing by radar","DPR inversion technique;Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar;Global Precipitation Measurement Mission;attenuation measurement;disdrometer measurements;dual-frequency radar rain retrieval algorithms;hydrometeors;nonRayleigh backscattering;raindrop size distribution variability;rainfall rate retrieval","","3","","16","","","April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The sensor and field data were acquired during the SMEX'02 experiment. The retrieval was obtained by using a Bayesian approach, where the key point is the evaluation of probability density functions (pdfs) based on the knowledge of soil parameter measurements and of the corresponding remotely sensing data. The purpose is to determine a useful parameterization of vegetation backscattering effects through suitable pdfs to be later used in the inversion algorithm. The correlation coefficients between measured and extracted soil moisture values are R=0.68 for C-band and R=0.60 for L-band. The pdf parameters have been found to be correlated to the vegetation water content estimated from a Landsat image with correlation coefficients of R=0.65 and 0.91 for C- and L-bands, respectively. In consideration of these correlations, a second run of the Bayesian procedure has been performed where the pdf parameters are variable with vegetation water content. This second procedure allows the improvement of inversion results for the L-band. The results derived from the Bayesian approach have also been compared with a classical inversion method that is based on a linear relationship between soil moisture and the backscattering coefficients for horizontal and vertical polarizations.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.872287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610828","Bayesian approach;inverse problems;optical imaging;radar imaging;soil moisture","Bayesian methods;Information retrieval;L-band;Laser radar;Optical sensors;Radar imaging;Radar remote sensing;Soil measurements;Soil moisture;Vegetation mapping","Bayes methods;backscatter;data acquisition;hydrological techniques;inverse problems;moisture measurement;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by laser beam;remote sensing by radar;soil;vegetation mapping","Bayesian procedure;L-band image;Landsat image;SMEX experiment;backscattering coefficient;correlation coefficient;horizontal polarization;inverse problems;inversion algorithm;optical images;probability density functions;radar images;soil moisture map;soil moisture retrieval;soil parameter measurements;vegetated areas;vegetated fields;vegetation backscattering effects;vegetation water content;vertical polarization","","36","","24","","","April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It was successfully launched onboard the Terra satellite in December 1999 and Aqua satellite in May 2002. Both MODIS instruments have been working well except that 15 of the 20 detectors in Aqua MODIS band 6 (1.628-1.652 μm) are either nonfunctional or noisy. The striping in Aqua MODIS band 6 caused by its nonfunctional or noisy detectors has been a serious problem for MODIS snow products, which use band 6 primarily for snow detection. MODIS scientists have been using Aqua MODIS band 7 (2.105-2.155 μm) instead of band 6 for computing the normalized difference snow index to continue detecting global snow coverage.

At the first phase, a discrimination network of multiple questions is used to retrieve explanatory knowledge structures each of which gives an interpretation of a text according to a particular aspect of fanaticism. Explanation structures organize past documents of fanatic content. Similar documents are retrieved to generate additional valuable information about the new document.

The usual way to do this is by a previous transmission scan to reconstruct the attenuation map. An important improvement could be achieved if it is possible to retrieve the attenuation map directly from the activity data. Several approaches have been suggested before to do this by using iterative methods for solving maximum likelihood (ML) problems (or penalized maximum likelihood, MAP) that take into account the Poisson nature of the noise. One of the main drawbacks has been that these methods tend to retrieve solutions that generate an undesired crosstalk between the attenuation and the activity maps. In this paper we present a new approach to the problem in positron emission tomography that uses a minorization function algorithm applied to the Poisson likelihood function; this algorithm, together with an appropriate decreasing multiplicative factor and iterative data refinement tend to eliminate the crosstalk between the images.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-9134-9","10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1530469","","Attenuation;Computed tomography;Costs;Crosstalk;Image reconstruction;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Positron emission tomography;Single photon emission computed tomography","image reconstruction;image retrieval;iterative methods;maximum likelihood estimation;positron emission tomography;stochastic processes","Poisson likelihood function;image retrieval;iterative methods;maximum likelihood methods;minorization function algorithm;penalized maximum likelihood;positron emission tomography;simultaneous activity attenuation reconstruction","","1","","8","","","11-14 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently such applications monitor store-keeping units (SKUs) rather than individual goods, as the relatively high cost of RFID deployment and the very low profit margin of supermarket products make item-level tagging impractical. Yet, economic and technical concerns aside, it is easy to envision a supermarket in which each item is tagged with an RFID label and all shopping carts feature RFID readers. The carts could potentially include onboard computers that recognize products placed inside and that display information and promotions retrieved wirelessly from the system back end. RFID-enabled smart phones, which are commercially available today and becoming increasingly popular, could carry out the same function. Item-level deployment of RFID technology would also allow for quick checkout aisles that scan all products at once and thus eliminate queues, which are consistently reported as one of the most negative aspects of supermarket shopping. A simple extension of this system would be to embed RFID devices in consumers' loyalty or frequent-shopper cards to identify individuals. This could expedite system login and charge the shopping cost directly to the customer's account at the point of sale-unless removed at the POS, item-level tags will inevitably follow the consumer home. This scenario undoubtedly raises numerous privacy concerns.","0018-9162;00189162","","10.1109/MC.2006.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607945","RFID technology;Security and privacy","Computer displays;Costs;Explosions;Information retrieval;Monitoring;RFID tags;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Tagging","radiofrequency identification;retail data processing;supply chain management","RFID device embedding;RFID readers;RFID-enabled smart phones;grocery product tracking;onboard computers;store-keeping units;supermarket shopping carts;supply chain","","62","1","12","","","March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since those studies on libre software evolution use SLOCs as the base metric, while Lehman's and other traditional studies use modules or files, it is difficult to compare both cases. To overcome this difficulty, and to explore the differences between SLOC and files/modules counts in libre software projects, we have selected a large sample of programs and have calculated both size metrics over time.

To overcome this difficulty, we developed a vector-valued inhomogeneous diffusion model that uses multiple features. In this model, we define the gradient threshold and thus the conductance parameter as a function of the texture and/or color gradient varying by evolving diffusion.

In this paper, a novel similarity measure method based on rough set and formal concept analysis (RFCA) is proposed to realize ontology mapping tasks. A reference concept lattice is first constructed with the combination of two normalized contexts. Rough set theory is then employed to calculate the similarity measure of the two ontology nodes. With a specified threshold, the final result of ontology mapping can be obtained. Compared with other mapping algorithms, the proposed ontology mapping method is featural and structural, and the mapping results are accurate and more confident.","","POD:0-7695-2522-9","10.1109/AICT-ICIW.2006.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1602313","","Information retrieval;Lattices;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Set theory;Software agents;Solid modeling;Spatial databases;Web services;Web sites","","","","7","","24","","","19-25 Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The hybrid method includes a sketch-based scheme and a string-based one to analyze and index a trajectory with more syntactic meanings. First of all, this method uses a sampling technique to extract a set of control points from each trajectory as features. Then, the sketch-based method uses a curve fitting technique to interpolate some missed data in this set of control points. Then, the visual distance between any two trajectories can be directly measured by comparing their position data. The visual distance is good in solving the problem of translation-invariant trajectory matching but poor in solving the problem of partial trajectory matching. Therefore, in addition to the visual distance, the hybrid method uses the string-based scheme to compare any two trajectories according to their syntactic meanings. With the help of the syntactic distance, many impossible candidates can be filtered out in advance and thus the accuracy of video retrieval can be much enhanced. In addition, the problem of partial trajectory matching will become easy to be solved. Thus, even though a partial trajectory is queried, all desired video clips still can be very accurately retrieved. Experimental results have proved the superiority of our proposed method.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2006.869965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1608167","Motion object detection;string matching;trajectory matching;video retrieval","Cameras;Curve fitting;Data mining;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Object detection;Position measurement;Sampling methods;Spatial databases;Web sites","curve fitting;image matching;image motion analysis;image retrieval;image sampling;video signal processing","curve fitting technique;motion-based video retrieval system;sampling technique;sketch-based scheme;string-based scheme;translation-invariant trajectory matching","","48","","30","","","March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On the other hand, from the websites owners point of view, a website is well-designed if it participates in increasing the companys overall profit, if it increases the users trust in the company and its products, and participates in making promotions for the company. Therefore, it is important to have a well-designed website. In our approach, we argue that we can help the website designer to improve the design structure of the website by giving him some information about the companys information system, its elements, and the relationships between different attributes of the information system that when considered in the design phase of the website will have a good effect in improving the website design structure.

Our algorithm has been tested on the segmentation of real audio data, and its performance has been compared with several existing algorithms for speaker segmentation, obtaining very good results in all test problems.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2005.857079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613936","Genetic algorithms (GAs);mutual information;speaker segmentation;unsupervised learning","Audio databases;Genetic algorithms;Hidden Markov models;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Mutual information;TV;Testing;Unsupervised learning","convergence;genetic algorithms;speaker recognition","GA convergence properties;audio content analysis tasks;audio record;compact encoding;evolutionary approach;fitness function;genetic algorithms;mutual information;offline speaker segmentation;speaker recognition","","6","","36","","","April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It has the following drawbacks. 1) Tremendous amount of human efforts are required to classify and annotate each trademark submitted for registration; the time required to complete the registration would increasing as the number of registered trademarks increases. 2) Same trademark may be classified into different classes by two human classifiers. 3) It is difficult to classify trademarks with abstractive contents by human classifier. For the above reasons, it is important to improve the existing trademark classification system by replacing human classifier with effective and precise computer algorithms. As we review previous researches on trademark indexing and retrieval, we find that shape information together with profile and contents of trademark plays an important role in determining the trademark similarity. In this paper, we develop an effective feature for trademark image using block feature index (BFI), the concept is borrowed from vector quantization. For performance evaluation purpose, 3000 trademark images in MEPG-7 were classified into 10 categories for experiments. We compare the recall rate and precision for the proposed BFIC algorithm and two well-known methods: Hu's 7 moments (H7M) and Zernike moments (ZKM), the proposed BFIC method outperforms the other two methods.

In this paper, we present a technique ICenter, which conducts DF and DC by recognizing the context of discussion (COD) of each document and category. Experiments on real-world data show that, through COD recognition, the performance of ICenter is significantly better. The results are of theoretical and practical significance.

In a vehicular sensor network, each vehicle is responsible for sensing one or more events, routing messages to other vehicles or infostations and processing sensed data. There are several critical differences between a vehicular sensor network and a ""traditional"" wireless sensor network, namely: 1) the vehicular network has high computation power; 2) it must provide high storage space; 3) it must have mobile sensor nodes. In addition, due to the sheer amount of data generated, sensed data is carried by each mobile sensor node. Admittedly, retrieving information from mobile sensor nodes is difficult. In this paper, we first identify a set of design choices for building a vehicular sensor network. From this we propose two storage architectures: content-addressed storage (CAS) and mobility-assist storage (MAS). While CAS utilizes infostations by hashing the key of an event to a specific infostation, MAS opportunistically disseminates events by ""relaying"" or sending events only to one's neighbors. CAS is appropriate for time-critical applications and MAS for delay-tolerant applications only if infrastructure is not available.

The content of an image is characterized by two kinds of features: Harris-Laplace interest points described by the SIFT descriptor and edges described by the edge color histogram. Edges and corners contain the maximal amount of information necessary for image retrieval.

These P2P overlay networks attempt to provide a long list of features, such as: selection of nearby peers, redundant storage, efficient search/location of data items, data permanence or guarantees, hierarchical naming, trust and authentication, and anonymity. P2P networks potentially offer an efficient routing architecture that is self-organizing, massively scalable, and robust in the wide-area, combining fault tolerance, load balancing, and explicit notion of locality.

Instead of detecting visually masked frequencies in two-dimensions, a simpler approach was used by converting an image to a one-dimensional signal. Using the well-established audio frequency masking procedure, audibly masked frequencies at a chosen sampling frequency were determined for each segment or block. Embedding of given data was carried out by modifying the spectral power at a pair of commonly occurring masked frequencies. Preliminary results of embedding 1024 bits of random data in a 256 times 256 pixel black-and-white image show that the spectrum modification technique is viable and simple to process.

As a matter of fact, in these conditions, the problem turns out to be more complicated than the tranverse magnetic (TM) scalar one in terms of mathematical model as well as computational costs. However, it is expected that more information on the scenario under test can be drawn from scattered data. Therefore, this study is aimed at verifying whether the TE case can provide additional information on the scenario under test (compared to the TM illumination) and how such an enhancement can be suitably exploited by the IMSA for improving the reconstruction accuracy of the retrieval process. Such an analysis will be carried out by means of a set of numerical experiments concerned with dielectric and metallic targets in single- and multiple-objects configurations.

Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive tools that can allow fast and efficient processing of information from huge image data.

The HI kernel is proved to be positive definite and thus can be used in support vector machine (SVM) based recognition. Experimentally, it also leads to good recognition performances. However, its derivation applies only for binary strings such as color histograms computed on equally sized images. In this paper, we propose a new kernel, which we named generalized histogram intersection (GHI) kernel, since it applies in a much larger variety of contexts. First, an original derivation of the positive definiteness of the GHI kernel is proposed in the general case. As a consequence, vectors of real values can be used, and the images no longer need to have the same size. Second, a hyper-parameter is added, compared to the HI kernel, which allows us to better tune the kernel model to particular databases. We present experiments which prove that the GHI kernel outperforms the simple HI kernel in a simple recognition task.

The probe-storage technique explored at IBM utilizes AFM probes and thermomechanical means to store and retrieve information in thin polymer films. High data rates are achieved by parallel operation of large 2D arrays with thousands of micro/nanomechanical cantilevers/tips that can be batch-fabricated by silicon surface micromachining techniques. The very high precision required to navigate the probe-tips over the storage medium is achieved by MEMS-based x/y actuators that position the large arrays of probe tips for parallel write/read/erase operations. For thermomechanical scanning-probe storage the polymer medium plays a crucial role. Based on a systematic study of different polymers it has been identified that the glass-transition temperature is the most important property that needs to be controlled for indentation writing and erasing at very narrow spacing. A prototype system demonstrating all the basic functions of a storage device based on scanning probes has been built and its main building blocks will be described in this paper. The inherent parallelism, the ultrahigh areal densities and the small form factor that probe storage techniques offer may open up new perspectives and opportunities for application in areas beyond those envisaged today.","2159-3523;21593523","POD:0-7803-9357-0","10.1109/NANOEL.2006.1609687","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609687","","Actuators;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Memory;Micromachining;Navigation;Polymer films;Scanning probe data storage;Silicon;Thermomechanical processes","","","","3","1","13","","","10-13 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The article proposes a mobile phone input method based on syllable word and implements the globe's first input method software for Tibetan characters on mobile phone. On the basis of analyzing the basic structure of Tibetan characters and the specific demands of mobile phones, we design the syllable word-based input method coding scheme, keyboard layout and software for Tibetan characters, and implement the complete Tibetan input method system on a mobile phone running Windows CE, enabling it for the receiving and sending of SMS. Finally suggestions for improvement are made to boost the efficiency and enhance functions of the Tibetan input method.","","POD:0-7695-2512-1","10.1109/ICESS.2005.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609897","Tibetan;Windows CE;embedded system;input method;mobile phone","Books;Cities and towns;Computer science;Embedded system;History;Informatics;Information retrieval;Keyboards;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets","mobile communication;mobile handsets;natural languages","SMS;Tibetan character software;Tibetan input method;Windows CE;keyboard layout;mobile communication;mobile phone;syllable word;word-based input method coding scheme","","4","","12","","","16-18 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the nature of XML data, formulating an XML query using an XML query language such as XQuery requires considerable effort. A user must be completely familiar with the syntax of the query language, and must be able to express his/her needs accurately in a syntactically correct form. In many real life applications it is not realistic to assume that users are proficient in expressing such textual queries. Hence, there is a need for a user-friendly visual querying schemes to replace data retrieval aspects of XQuery. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient processing of XQueries in the relational environment where the queries are formulated using a user-friendly GUI. We take a novel and non-traditional approach to improving query performance by prefetching data during the formulation of a query in a single-user environment. The latency offered by the GUI-based query formulation is utilized to prefetch portions of the query results. The basic idea we employ for prefetching is that we prefetch constituent path expressions, store the intermediary results, reuse them when connective is added or ""Run"" is pressed.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2570-9","10.1109/ICDE.2006.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1617520","","Data engineering;Database languages;Delay;Graphical user interfaces;Information retrieval;Prefetching;Query processing;Relational databases;Time measurement;XML","","","","1","","3","","","03-07 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the explanation and test of this work, only two images features (semantic evidences) are involved: color and shape (from gradients of directions). However, one of the main advantages of the proposed strategy is its easy extension to several evidences. Considering the precision with which the images are retrieved, to highlight the evidences that generate the best results, we have introduced the use of nonextensive entropy. This concept extends the Shannon's classic theory of entropy for information systems. Experimental results show that may be a link between the parameters of the Tsalli's nonextensive entropy and the precision with which the images are retrieved from the database. In some cases, we have obtained up to 30% in terms of average precision.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-9134-9","10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1530570","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Content based retrieval;Entropy;Equations;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatial databases","belief networks;content-based retrieval;entropy;image retrieval","Bayesian network;Tsallis entropy;content-based image retrieval;information systems;nonextensive entropy;semantic evidences","","3","","5","","","11-14 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we present a fuzzy approach toward hierarchic audio classification and global segmentation framework based on automatic audio analysis providing robust, bi-modal, efficient and parameter invariant classification over global audio segments. The input audio is split into segments, which are classified as speech, music, fuzzy or silent. The proposed method minimizes critical errors of misclassification by fuzzy region modeling, thus increasing the efficiency of both pure and fuzzy classification. The experimental results show that the critical errors are minimized and the proposed framework significantly increases the efficiency and the accuracy of audio-based retrieval especially in large multimedia databases.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TSA.2005.857573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1621218","Automatic audio classification and segmentation;fuzzy modeling;multimedia indexing and retrieval;perceptual rule-based approach","Audio coding;Content based retrieval;Digital audio players;Indexing;Information resources;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Music information retrieval;Robustness;Speech enhancement","audio databases;database indexing;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;multimedia databases","automatic audio segmentation;fuzzy approach;fuzzy region modeling;generic audio classification;multimedia databases;multimedia indexing;multimedia retrieval","","30","1","28","","","May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
