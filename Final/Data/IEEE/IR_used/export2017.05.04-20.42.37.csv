In KSORD, retrieval of user's initial query is often unsatisfying. User has to reformulate his query and execute the new query, which costs much time and effort. A method of automatically reformulating user queries by user feedback aimed at the results of KSORD is introduced in this paper, which is named UFBP (user feedback based on probability). After the first time of retrieval, according to the users' feedback information, UFBP computes terms to be added into the expanded query based on probability and reformulates the new query using query expansion. After KSORD executing the new query automatically, more relevant results are presented to user. Experimental results verify its effectiveness.","","POD:978-0-7695-3874-7","10.1109/WISA.2009.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368092","information retrieval;relational database;relevance feedback","Application software;Computer science;Educational technology;Feedback;Information retrieval;Information systems;Keyword search;Relational databases;Tree graphs;Writing","probability;query processing;relational databases;relevance feedback","information retrieval;keyword search;probability;query expansion;relational database;user feedback","","1","","17","","","18-20 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a <i>double rulings</i> scheme that stores data replicas on a curve instead of one or multiple isolated sensors. The consumer travels along another curve that is guaranteed to intersect the producer curve. The double rulings is a natural extension of the flat hashing scheme such as GHTs. It has improved query locality-i.e., consumers close to producers find the data quickly-and structured aggregate queries, i.e., a consumer following a curve is able to retrieve <i>all</i> the data. Furthermore, by the flexibility of retrieval mechanisms, we have better routing robustness (as multiple retrieval paths are available) and data robustness against regional node failures. We show by simulation that the double rulings scheme provides reduced communication costs and more balanced traffic load on the sensors.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2015573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5164895","Data-centric routing;double rulings;information storage and retrieval;sensor networks","","information retrieval","double rulings;flat hashing scheme;geographical hash table;information brokerage;retrieval mechanism flexibility;sensor networks","","30","","34","","20090714","Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A grasp of emotions in songs might be a great help for us to effectively discover music. In this paper, we aimed at automatically classifying moods of songs based on lyrics and metadata, and proposed several methods for supervised learning of classifiers. In future, we plan to use automatically identified moods of songs as metadata in our music search engine. Mood categories in a famous contest about Audio Music Mood Classification (MIREX 2007) are applied for our system. The training data is collected from a LiveJournal blog site in which each blog entry is tagged with a mood and a song. Then three kinds of machine learning algorithms are applied for training classifiers: SVM, Naive Bayes and Graph-based methods. The experiments showed that artist, sentiment words, putting more weight for words in chorus and title parts are effective for mood classification. Graph-based method promises a good improvement if we have rich relationship information among songs.","","POD:978-1-4244-5086-2","10.1109/KSE.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361715","machine learning;mood classification;music information retrieval;text categorization","Humans;Information services;Internet;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mood;Search engines;Supervised learning;Training data;Web sites","Bayes methods;Web sites;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);meta data;music;pattern classification;search engines;support vector machines","LiveJournal blog site;SVM;audio music mood classification;graph-based methods;machine learning approaches;metadata;mood categories;mood classification;music search engine;naive Bayes methods;song lyrics;supervised learning","","3","","13","","","13-17 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional methods of audio music search use distance measures between features derived from the audio for this task. We describe three techniques that make use of music classifiers to derive representations of audio features that are based on culturally motivated information learned by the classifier. When these representations are used for similarity estimation, they produce very significant reductions in computational complexity over existing techniques (such as those based on the KL-divergence), and also produce metric similarity spaces, which facilitate the use of technologies for the sub-linear scaling of search times. We have evaluated each system using both pseudo-objective techniques and human listeners, and we demonstrate that this efficiency gain is obtained while providing a comparable level of performance when compared with existing techniques.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2025533","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5410074","Music information retrieval (MIR);music semantics;music similarity estimation","Collaboration;Computational complexity;Cultural differences;Databases;Filtering;Humans;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Performance gain;Space technology","audio signal processing;information retrieval;music","audio music search;audio music similarity estimation;cultural representation;metric similarity space;music classifier;music information retrieval;pseudoobjective technique;sublinear scaling","","0","","46","","","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We compare the performance of our design against that of available hardware based dot product processors as well a server class processor using optimum software code performing the same computation. We show that our hardware design can achieve a speedup of 62,000 times compared to an available hardware design and a speedup of 8866 times with 33% (1.5 times) less power consumption, compared to software code running on Intel Xeon processor for 1024 basis vectors. Our design can significantly reduce the amount of servers required for similarity comparison in a distributed search engine.

The technology for radio frequency identification (RFID) enables data to be transmitted by a tiny portable device, called a tag, which is read by an RFID reader and processed according to the needs of a particular application. It is only recently that the technology has begun to take off in the mass market. RFID applications in mobile phone business have not yet been deployed in other that small scale, but the discussion around this topic has been really started. Analysts predict that RFID will revolutionize areas of industry, such as supply chain management and the retail business, for example by reducing costs with better stock management. As the components for RFID-systems - tags and readers - have become smaller and cheaper, the technology has begun to take-off, in a variety of different areas This paper focuses on the applications of RFID technology in mobile telecommunication services. Many experts see RFID as an enabler for ubiquitous computing - the integration of computation into the environment: any device, anytime, anywhere. Reservation could be as simple as holding your phone close (less than 20 centimeters) to a poster or advertising billboard. RFID enabled mobile phones could be a first step in this direction.

As this framework detects possible events occurring in video clips, it forms the annotating base of a video search engine. To achieve this purpose, the system has to able to operate on uncontrolled wide-domain videos. Thus, all layers have to be based on generic features. The aim is to help bridge the “semantic gap“, which is the difference between the low-level visual features and the human's perception, by finding videos with similar visual events, then analyzing their free text annotation to find the best description for this new video using commonsense knowledgebases.

We refer to the two records of the same or similar circumstances as <i>master</i> and <i>duplicate</i> records. Current record retrieval techniques are lacking when applied to this special master defect record retrieval problem. In this study, we propose a new paradigm for master defect record retrieval using network-based feature association (NBFA). We train the master record retrieval process by constructing feature associations to limit the search space. The retrieval paradigm was employed and tested on a real-world large-scale defect record database from a telecommunications company. The empirical results suggest that the NBFA was able to significantly improve the performance of master record retrieval, and should be implemented in practice.

The basic approaches for information retrieval in text documents are searching using keywords, categorization of the documents and filtering out the stream. To extract information from raw data, its complexity needed to be first reduced. Clustering methods and Projection methods are aimed at reducing the amount of data and dimensionality of data respectively. SOM is a special case in that it can be used at the same time for both clustering and projection. It projects onto a 2D-grid. Various methods were developed for the automatic clustering of worldwide webdocuments according to the user requirements. The objective of this paper is to reduce the time and effort the user has to find the information sought after. The method termed topological organization of content can generate classified topics from a set of unstructured documents. The TOC is a set of hierarchically organized 1D-growing SOMs. In TOC, vector space model is used for indexing of 1D-SOM. In the proposed approach, latent semantic indexing of 1D-SOM can be used to enhance the association between terms. Latent semantic analysis is a technique that projects the original high dimensional document vector into a space with latent semantic dimensions. A term-by-document matrix is constructed for the information retrieval. A brief review is given on existing methods for documents clustering and organization. The proposed method which can use LSI will be efficient in terms of computational cost, accuracy and visualization. It can be easily adapted for large data set. The proposed method will provide feature for retrieving meaningful related topics.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6491-3; POD:978-1-4244-6488-3","10.1109/ICINNOVCT.2010.5440089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440089","Document categorization;information retrieval;latent semantic analysis(LSA);one-dimensional self-organizing map (1D-SOM)","Clustering methods;Computational efficiency;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Functional analysis;Indexing;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Large scale integration","document handling;information retrieval;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps","2D grid;LSI;clustering methods;document categorization;high dimensional document vector;information retrieval;latent semantic analysis;projection methods;self organising map;text documents;topological content organization;unstructured content;worldwide Web documents","","1","","21","","","12-13 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The efficiency of the proposed retrieval method is characterized by greater accuracy and flexibility in capturing the color texture information. Using a database of 640 color textures, the experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves retrieval rates compared with traditional color approaches, while it enjoys a similar computational complexity.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3754-2; POD:978-1-4244-4633-9","10.1109/BLISS.2009.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376809","Hypecomplex Wavelets Transforms;Information Retrieval;Quaternion Wavelets;Quaternions;Retrieval Performance","Application software;Feature extraction;Frequency;Image databases;Image processing;Image retrieval;Image texture;Image texture analysis;Information retrieval;Wavelet packets","Gaussian processes;feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image texture;statistical analysis;wavelet transforms","Kullbak-Leibler distance;color texture information;color texture retrieval;feature extraction;generalized Gaussian density;hypercomplex wavelet;image classification;similarity measurement;statistical model;statistical representation","","0","","6","","","20-21 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a pioneering work in this direction by taking word stemming, a crucial aspect of search and indexing algorithms and showing how significant performance gain can be accomplished by employing multi-core architectures, which will serve the purpose of home computers in near future. We present our analysis of Porter's stemming algorithm on Cell Broadband Engine and describe the manner in which SIMD operations can be utilized to maximize performance.

In this paper, we show that considering the mixture, an estimation of its main melody and its accompaniment as modalities allows us to propose new ways of defining the similarity between musical streams. In the context of the detection of cover version, we show that highest performance is achieved by jointly considering the mixture and the estimated accompaniment. As demonstrated by the experiments carried out using two different evaluation databases, this scheme allows the scoring system to focus more on the chord progression by considering the accompaniment while being robust to the potential separation errors by also considering the mixture.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4244-4296-6; POD:978-1-4244-4295-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5495217","Cover Song Identification;Main melody extraction;Music Information Retrieval;Music Similarity;Signal Processing","Data mining;Databases;Face detection;Lagrangian functions;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Robustness;Signal processing;Streaming media;Telecommunications","audio signal processing;music","chord progression;cover version detection;multimodal similarity;musical audio stream accompaniment;musical audio stream melody;musical streams","","4","","13","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of Web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine to defi- > ne the values and traditional techniques of data in hypertext. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext.

RABI divides inverted list into blocks and compresses different part of each block with the corresponding compression method to decrease space consumption. Based on RABI, DMS distinguishes between long and short posting lists. Then short posting lists are updated by remerge strategy and long posting lists are updated by hybrid in-place and remerge strategy.

It is primarily because the spectral envelops as well as the shapes of vocal tracks vary frequently so as to produce fake peaks in the detection function that degrade the precision rate for onset detection. This paper proposes an onset detection scheme which utilizes the enhanced difference filter to improve the detection function by accentuating the peaks at the uprising margins of energy, and the adjustment approach for onset locations to compensate the peak shifts. A binary classifier based on GMM is further used to combine relevant features of adjacent peaks so as to make more reliable final decisions.

This work attempts to induce high level semantics from the low level descriptors of the images. In this paper, we propose a new approach that integrates techniques of salient, color and texture features. Our approach extracts interest salient regions that work as local descriptors. A greedy graph matching algorithm with a proposed modified scoring function is applied to determine the final image rank. The proposed approach is appropriate for accurately retrieving images even in distortion cases such as geometric deformations and noise. This approach was tested on proprietary image databases.

We have developed a Question Answering system which aims to analyze the user's question, to retrieve the most relevant documents from MEDLINE, and to extract from these retrieved documents a list of candidate answers, ranked by confidence. These candidate answers are concepts issued from biomedical controlled vocabularies, such as the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for a first step, and are extracted from the most relevant documents with pattern matching strategies. For evaluation purposes, we apply the system on two biological databases, UniProt and DrugBank. From these resources, we generated two large benchmarks of 200 questions dealing respectively with diseases and proteins, and with diseases and drugs. For these 2 sets, the first candidate answer proposed by our system is respectively correct in 57% and in 68%, while respectively 70% and 75% of all answers to find are contained in the ten first proposed candidate answers.

The network traffic should be kept at a minimum to reduce costs.

Most tempo estimation systems focus mainly on detecting the temporal repetition and periodicity present within a signal, and represent tempo as a count of beats-per-minute (BPM). However, in real-world music retrieval applications such as music navigation and playlist generation, a rough perceptual representation of tempo may be more appropriate than a BPM representation. In this paper, the problem of tempo estimation is presented as a statistical classification problem. Four perceptual tempo classes are defined which correspond to rough semantic terms that average users may use to describe tempo. Statistical models of each class are built using low-level audio features. Experimental results show that the perceptual tempo class representation outperforms several conventional BPM-based tempo estimation systems when applied to the tasks of music navigation and playlist generation.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.54","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381398","music classification;music information retrieval;music navigation;music similarity;perceptual tempo;playlist generation;tempo estimation","Acoustic distortion;Humans;Instruments;Machine learning;Mood;Music information retrieval;Navigation;Testing","audio signal processing;classification;information retrieval;music;statistical analysis","automatic tempo estimation;beats-per-minute;class-based representation;low-level audio features;music categorization;music navigation;music retrieval;perceptual tempo;playlist generation;rough semantic terms;statistical classification problem;statistical models","","1","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, scholars have used them to evaluate similarities between tonalities, melodies and rhythms for music information retrieval. In this study, similarity functions are generated automatically. We focus on similarities between the so-called pitch-class sets that belong to the field of pitch-class set theory. Pitch-class set theory offers a well-defined mathematical framework for categorising musical objects and describing their relationships. An output, consisting of similarity values between the abstract pitch-class sets, is produced by means of a generated function. We then compare these values with empirical results by means of statistical methods. We also compare the performance of a generated function with that of REL (David Lewin 1980), perhaps the most successful similarity function in the field. The achieved results are encouraging: some of the generated functions are able to produce stronger correlations with empirical data than REL. As a satisfying by-product, the results hint at the fact that there may be a connection between the perceived closeness of pitch-class sets and Shepard's universal cognitive models.

Furthermore, as we aim at using “real world” scores, we follow an approach which does exploit the rhythm information (considered unreliable) and test its robustness to score errors. We use a unified framework to handle different state-of-the-art features, and propose a simple way to exploit either a model of the feature values, or an audio synthesis of a musical score, in an audio-to-score alignment system. We confirm that chroma vectors drawn from representations using a logarithmic frequency scale are the most efficient features, and lead to a good precision, even with a simple alignment strategy. Robustness tests also show that the relative performance of the features do not depend on possible musical score degradations.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4244-4296-6; POD:978-1-4244-4295-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495784","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5495784","acoustic features;automatic alignment;music information retrieval","Acoustic testing;Audio recording;Degradation;Feature extraction;Frequency synchronization;Machine assisted indexing;Music information retrieval;Performance evaluation;Rhythm;Robustness","acoustic signal processing;audio acoustics;musical acoustics","audio data;audio synthesis;audio-to-score alignment system;chroma vectors;logarithmic frequency scale;musical score degradations;rhythm information;symbolic level music-to-score alignment;tonal acoustic features","","10","","13","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, geographic scope is a concept that can be interpreted in many different ways, ranging from the expected target scope of a specific content to the country where the content originated. The latter, in particular, albeit difficult to address, is of great importance for many reasons, such as, for example, market inquiries or anytime estimates on content production in specific countries are needed. Search engines may also be affected by the knowledge of the various kinds of geographic scopes, to better tune their responses to queries, e.g. according to (but not restricted to) the geographic proximity with the user location. However that information is rarely available and must be inferred in the vast majority of the cases. In this paper we propose a technique, grounded into the machine learning theory, to estimate source geography of web pages by means of a classifier learned on a specially constructed training set. The training set, consisting of a number of features extracted from web pages and the corresponding source-geography label (i.e. the country of origin of the web page) is automatically built by exploiting the wide number of pages with contents licensed under a localized Creative Commons (CC) license. The model thus learned is then used to classify unlabeled records and our tests showed a mean accuracy of 81% with a standard deviation of 0:9.","2162-7843;21627843","Electronic:978-1-4244-5950-6; POD:978-1-4244-5949-0","10.1109/ISSPIT.2009.5407588","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5407588","Classification;Geographic information retrieval","Data mining;Estimation theory;Feature extraction;Geography;Information retrieval;Internet;Machine learning;Production;Search engines;Web pages","Bayes methods;Internet;classification;geography;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","Naive Bayes models;Web pages;classifier;geographic proximity;geographic scope;localized Creative Commons license;machine learning theory;search engines;source geography estimation;user location","","0","","24","","","14-17 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a huge size of matrix needs more memory space to save and more calculation to find out the solutions. With the assumption of using distribution in order to decrease the required memory space and to reduce the run-time problem, we did a research and implemented distributed LSI. To meet a better improvement, clustering is concerned for document too. In this combination, term-document matrix is recreated for each cluster and retrieval is accomplished on these set of term-document matrices.

Their purpose is to maximize user satisfaction when performing this task. Although there are other sources of evidence, besides text, to characterize document relevance for a specific need, especially for HTML documents, current search engines do not allow users to explore these features when posing a query. Search engine queries are based almost exclusively on keywords. We believe that it is possible to improve user satisfaction if HTML tags and document metadata are available to users at query time. In this paper we present Xearch, a meta-search system that wraps public search engines in a framework that improves both the expressiveness of the language available for the user to specify information needs and the control over the answer format. Xearch converts HTML pages to a specific XML schema, covering text and metadata derived from HTML. User queries are then submitted on this schema and can be specified through keywords but also explore documents' HTML tags and metadata.

First, a low-level measure based on tempo-related aspects, and second, a high-level semantic measure based on regression by support vector machines of different groups of musical dimensions such as genre and culture, moods and instruments, or rhythm and tempo. We evaluate these distance measures against a number of state-of-the-art measures objectively, based on 17 ground truth musical collections, and subjectively, based on 12 listeners' ratings. Results show that, in spite of being conceptually different, the proposed methods achieve comparable or even higher performance than the considered baseline approaches.

While typical content-based image retrieval systems operate in some parameter space, the introduced data-driven technique uses as features the very image data, represented as sets of recurring patterns collected in dictionaries. In a first offline step, the images are quantized in the Hue Saturation Value space and converted into strings, after being modified to preserve some vertical information in the process, and representative dictionaries are extracted from each string with a data compression algorithm; subsequently, the dictionaries are matched in pairs and the distance between each couple of them is estimated. On the basis of the computed distances, the system enables the user to retrieve images with similar content to a given query image. Compression-based classification techniques, being data-driven, have the drawback of being computationally intensive and have been applied, in the general case, to restricted datasets; instead, the low-complexity solutions employed in this work allow applying this similarity measure on larger datasets, keeping at the same time the desirable parameter-free approach which is characteristic of these methods.

In this paper a new algorithm is proposed that makes use of a data structure that facilitates multidimensional range search. An m-dimensional top-k query can be processed by searching for the data items that satisfies a range of score over each dimension. At every step of the algorithm a new set of ranges (one for each dimension) is specified such that more accurate tuples are added in the candidate top-k set. The process continues till we get the actual top-k data items. The incremented range set is specified with the help of the statistics of the distribution of data items in m-dimensional space. Thus, efficiency of the algorithm very much depends on the proper study and analysis of the distribution of the data items in the m-dimensional space and the data structure used.","","Electronic:978-9-3800-4357-9; POD:978-1-4244-5051-0","10.1109/ICM2CS.2009.5397964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5397964","Database Indexing;FA;Information Retrieval;Multidimensional Range Search;TA;Top-k Query Processing","Computer science;Costs;Data engineering;Data structures;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Middleware;Multidimensional systems;Multimedia databases;Query processing","data analysis;data structures;query processing","data item distribution analysis;data structure;m-dimensional space;m-dimensional top-k query processing;multidimensional range search","","0","","8","","","14-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In previous method, expansion terms are usually selected by counting term co-occurrences in the documents. However, term co-occurrences are not always a good indicator for relevance, whereas some are background terms of the whole collection. In order to select good expansion terms, Google similarity distance is adopted in our model to estimate two kinds of relevance weight. One is the relevance weight between query and its relevant term extracted from the top-ranked documents in initial retrieval results. The other is the relevance weight between each query term and its relevant terms extracted from the snapshot of Google search result when that query term is used as search keyword. The estimated relevance weights are used to select good expansion terms for second retrieval. The experiments on the two test collections show that our expansion terms selection model is more effective than the standard Rocchio expansion.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5824-0; POD:978-1-4244-5821-9","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497592","Query expansion;information retrieval;relevant terms","Computer science;Degradation;Feedback;Information retrieval;Robustness;Statistical analysis;Testing;Thesauri","document handling;query formulation;relevance feedback;search engines","Google search result;Google similarity distance;candidate expansion terms;expansion terms selection model;query expansion terms;relevance weight;search keyword;standard Rocchio expansion;term co-occurrences;top-ranked documents","","1","","19","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for comparing different algorithms adopted by different search engines and evaluate their performance. In our approach, the results of each algorithm is treated as an inter-related set of documents and the effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated based on the degree of relation in the set of documents. After verifying the correctness of the evaluation measure by examining the results of the two retrieval algorithms, BM25 and pivoted normalization, and comparing these results with an ideal ranking, we compare the results of these algorithms and investigate the impact of certain major factors like stemming on the results of the suggested algorithm.

For index construction, the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is used to efficiently retrieve similarity queries in a small fraction of the database.

The reason why collaborative tagging system becomes popular is users can freely tags on the resources, like Flickr1 and Delicious2. Any relationship between tags and resources are not made explicitly when tagging in folksonomy. Due to lack of semantic meaning, it is difficult for users to find related resources. Also, short of sufficient number of relevant tags increase the data sparsity which decreases the rate of information extraction against the user queries. Defining semantic relationship between tags, resources and users is an important research issue to retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this paper, we propose a WordNet based method to find the semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy.

GMMs are used as parametric clustering method to describe the distribution of the training data. Different low-level audio features are assessed with regard to their ability to perform this task. Further, we study the influence of the accompaniment music on the performance of the classifier. We find that the performance of the classifier also depends on the background music of the training and testing data. Some features, even if they yielded useful results on isolated vocal tracks, are not able to preserve information about the vocal content when mixed with background music, thus leading to erroneous classifications.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381403","GMM;low-level features;music information retrieval;rap;sing","Autoregressive processes;Cepstral analysis;Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Instruments;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Music;Speech analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);music;pattern classification;pattern clustering","Bayesian classifier;GMM;Gaussian mixture models;accompaniment music;audio segments classification;low-level acoustic features;parametric clustering method;training data distribution;urban genre;vocal segments","","0","","19","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
