Even though relational database management systems (RDBMs) have provided full-text search capabilities, they do not support keyword-based search model. The text databases and relational databases are different that is a challenging task to apply the keyword search techniques in information retrieval (IR) to DB. A common method to performing keyword search in relational database is to generate the minimum connected tuple sets in schema graph transformed from relations. Although existing candidate network (CN) generation methods retrieve a set of joining tuples, they are still problem which is causing large overhead for CNs generation. In this paper, we propose a new candidate network generation algorithm (Heuristic_CNGen) based on the iterative deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm. The proposed algorithm produces a minimum number of CNs according to the maximum number of tuple set. We generate CNs for a given keyword query. And then, we identify the connected tuple tree as a result according to generated CNs. We evaluate the proposed method on DBLP.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1090-1; POD:978-1-4673-1091-8","10.1109/InfRKM.2012.6204992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6204992","Candidate Network;Connected Tuple Tree;Keyword-based;Relational Database","Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Keyword search;Radio frequency;Relational databases;XML","full-text databases;iterative methods;query processing;relational databases;trees (mathematics)","CN generation;DBLP;IDA*;IR;RDBM;candidate network generation methods;connected tuple trees querying;full-text search capabilities;heuristic-CNGen;information retrieval;iterative deepening A* algorithm;minimum connected tuple sets generation;relational database management systems;relational keyword-based search model;schema graph;text databases","","0","","12","","","13-15 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Product aspect ranking using sentiment analysis and TOPSIS","S. A. A. A. Alrababah; K. H. Gan; T. P.

Most of the conducted research studies extract the product aspects based on three main criteria: 1) extracting the aspects that have been commented repeatedly in online reviews, 2) determining of important aspects as those that have been described positively and negatively by many customers in their reviews, and 3) the association between the domain product aspect (like `camera') and the other aspects contained in a specific product review. However, a lacuna remains as how to efficiently investigate online reviews to identify the most important product aspects by considering all the three criteria jointly. In response, this paper proposes a novel product aspect ranking framework using sentiment analysis and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The proposed work is decomposed into two stages: aspect extraction and aspect ranking. In aspect extraction stage, sentiment analysis is used to identify the product aspects from customer reviews in an unsupervised manner based on the three criteria of extraction. In the second stage, the extracted product aspects from the previous criteria have been involved simultaneously in TOPSIS to produce a ranked list of the most representative product aspects. The empirical evaluation of the proposed work using online reviews of four products shows its effectiveness in finding representative aspects.","","CD:978-1-5090-2953-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-2954-9; POD:978-1-5090-2955-6","10.1109/INFRKM.2016.7806327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806327","Aspect ranking;MCDM;Sentiment analysis;TOPSIS;WordNet","Cameras;Correlation;Decision making;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Sentiment analysis","TOPSIS;Web sites;electronic commerce;sentiment analysis","TOPSIS;aspect extraction stage;customer reviews;domain product aspect;e-commerce Websites;online reviews;product aspect ranking framework;product review;sentiment analysis;technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution","","","","","","","23-24 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Retrieving knowledge can be seen as high level goals and the tasks involved can be decomposed into subtask to achieve the specified goals. We execute the composition of service by treating composition as planning problem using Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning system based on Simple Hierarchical Order Planner 2 (SHOP2). The approach for plan (task) decomposition using SHOP2 is implemented in automated way.

"Private Information Retrieval","X. Yi; R. Paulet; E. Bertino","","Private Information Retrieval","20140702","2013","","","","","This book deals with Private Information Retrieval (PIR), a technique allowing a user to retrieve an element from a server in possession of a database without revealing to the server which element is retrieved. PIR has been widely applied to protect the privacy of the user in querying a service provider on the Internet. For example, by PIR, one can query a location-based service provider about the nearest car park without revealing his location to the server. The first PIR approach was introduced by Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz and Sudan in 1995 in a multi-server setting, where the user retrieves information from multiple database servers, each of which has a copy of the same database. To ensure user privacy in the multi-server setting, the servers must be trusted not to collude. In 1997, Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky constructed the first single-database PIR. Since then, many efficient PIR solutions have been discovered. Beginning with a thorough survey of single-database PIR techniques, this text focuses on the latest technologies and applications in the field of PIR. The main categories are illustrated with recently proposed PIR-based solutions by the authors. Because of the latest treatment of the topic, this text will be highly beneficial to researchers and industry professionals in information security and privacy.","","97816270515","10.2200/S00524ED1V01Y201307SPT005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6813413.pdf&bkn=6813412&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","2013","","","","Morgan & Claypool","Morgan and Claypool eBooks"

Most existing metrics evaluate pairwise shot similarity based only on shot perceptual content, which is denoted as content-based similarity. In this study, our concern is to recognize and detect video events that are “semantically similar”. Thus, we extend the content-based similarity to measure the conceptual content of shots. Here, conceptual content refers to the dynamic semantic concept which reflects a “human-action” regardless the perceptual/visual appearance. In addition, we propose a new similarity metric to make use of the shot contexts in video clips collection. The context of a shot is built by constructing a vector with each dimension representing the content similarity between the shot and any shot in the video collection. The context similarity between two videos is obtained by computing the similarity between the corresponding context vectors using the vector similarity functions. Furthermore, a linear and non-linear fusion schemes are introduced to compute the relative contributions of each similarity in the overall retrieval and classification process. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of the context similarity can significantly improve the retrieval performance.","","Electronic:978-8-9886-7827-5; POD:978-1-4244-7607-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5568602","","Computational modeling;Estimation;Image resolution","content-based retrieval;image classification;video retrieval;video signal processing","content combination;content-based video retrieval;context information;video clips collection;video events classification;video events retrieval","","1","","16","","","16-18 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purpose of Sentence Compression in Text Summarization is to produce a compact and informational content by eliminating unnecessary constituent in a sentence. We introduce a Pattern-Growth text representation model named Frequent Adjacent Sequential Pattern (FASP) and Frequent Eliminated Pattern (FASPe) to represent the text using a set of sequence adjacent words or “textual pattern” that are frequently used and eliminated across the Malay news document collection. From the discovered textual pattern, we derived some heuristic Sentence Compression Rules in generating compressed sentences to construct a single extract Malay summary. We conducted experiments on Malay news dataset and the result demonstrates that moderate compressed summary using Sentence Compression Rules has better agreement with human composed summary.","","CD:978-1-5090-2953-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-2954-9; POD:978-1-5090-2955-6","10.1109/INFRKM.2016.7806326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806326","Malay;Pattern-Growth;Sentence Compression;Text Summarization;component","Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Pragmatics;Semantics;Syntactics","information resources;natural language processing;text analysis","FASP;FASPe;Malay news document collection;Malay text summarizer;frequent adjacent sequential pattern;frequent eliminated pattern;heuristic sentence compression rules;pattern-growth method;pattern-growth text representation model;salient information extraction;summary generation;text summarization;textual pattern;user readability;verbatim","","","","","","","23-24 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This book introduces the topic of IR and how it differs from other computer science disciplines. A discussion of the history of modern IR is briefly presented, and the notation of IR as used in this book is defined. The complex notation of relevance is discussed. Some applications of IR is noted as well since IR has many practical uses today. Using information retrieval with fuzzy logic to search for software terms can help find software components and ultimately help increase the reuse f software. This is just one practical application of IR that is covered in this book.</p> <p>Some of the classical models of IR is presented as a contrast to extending the Boolean model. This includes a brief mention of the source of weights for the various models. In a typical retrieval environment, answers are either yes or no, i.e., on or off. On the other hand, fuzzy logic can bring in a ""degree of"" match, vs. a crisp, i.e., strict match. This, too, is looked at and explored in much detail, showing how it can be applied to information retrieval. Fuzzy logic is often times considered a soft computing application and this book explores how IR with fuzzy logic and its membership functions as weights can help indexing, querying, and matching. Since fuzzy set theory and logic is explored in IR systems, the explanation of where the fuzz is ensues.</p> <p>The concept of relevance feedback, including pseudorelevance feedback is explored for the various mod ls of IR. For the extended Boolean model, the use of genetic algorithms for relevance feedback is delved into.</p> <p>The concept of query expansion is explored using rough set theory. Various term relationships is modeled and presented, and the model extended for fuzzy retrieval. An example using the UMLS terms is also presented. The model is also extended for term relationships beyond synonyms.</p> <p>Finally, this book looks at clustering, both crisp and fuzzy, to see how that can improve retrieval performance. An example is presented to illustrate the concepts.</p>","","97816270595","10.2200/S00752ED1V01Y201701ICR055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=7833478.pdf&bkn=7833477&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","2017","","","","Morgan & Claypool","Morgan and Claypool eBooks"
"Visual Information Retrieval using Java and LIRE","M. Lux; O. Marques","","Visual Information Retrieval using Java and LIRE","20140702","2013","","","","","Visual information retrieval (VIR) is an active and vibrant research area, which attempts at providing means for organizing, indexing, annotating, and retrieving visual information (images and videos) from large, unstructured repositories. The goal of VIR is to retrieve matches ranked by their relevance to a given query, which is often expressed as an example image and/or a series of keywords. During its early years (1995-2000), the research efforts were dominated by content-based approaches contributed primarily by the image and video processing community. During the past decade, it was widely recognized that the challenges imposed by the lack of coincidence between an image's visual contents and its semantic interpretation, also known as semantic gap, required a clever use of textual metadata (in addition to information extracted from the image's pixel contents) to make image and video retrieval solutions efficient and effective. The need to bridge (or at least narrow) the semanti gap has been one of the driving forces behind current VIR research. Additionally, other related research problems and market opportunities have started to emerge, offering a broad range of exciting problems for computer scientists and engineers to work on. In this introductory book, we focus on a subset of VIR problems where the media consists of images, and the indexing and retrieval methods are based on the pixel contents of those images -- an approach known as content-based image retrieval (CBIR). We present an implementation-oriented overview of CBIR concepts, techniques, algorithms, and figures of merit. Most chapters are supported by examples written in Java, using Lucene (an open-source Java-based indexing and search implementation) and LIRE (Lucene Image REtrieval), an open-source Java-based library for CBIR.

"Multimedia Information Retrieval","S. Rueger","","Multimedia Information Retrieval","20140702","2009","","","","","At its very core multimedia information retrieval means the process of searching for and finding multimedia documents; the corresponding research field is concerned with building the best possible multimedia search engines. The intriguing bit here is that the query itself can be a multimedia excerpt: For example, when you walk around in an unknown place and stumble across an interesting landmark, would it not be great if you could just take a picture with your mobile phone and send it to a service that finds a similar picture in a database and tells you more about the building -- and about its significance, for that matter? This book goes further by examining the full matrix of a variety of query modes versus document types. How do you retrieve a music piece by humming? What if you want to find news video clips on forest fires using a still image? The text discusses underlying techniques and common approaches to facilitate multimedia search engines from metadata driven retrieval, via iggy-back text retrieval where automated processes create text surrogates for multimedia, automated image annotation and content-based retrieval. The latter is studied in great depth looking at features and distances, and how to effectively combine them for efficient retrieval, to a point where the readers have the ingredients and recipe in their hands for building their own multimedia search engines. Supporting users in their resource discovery mission when hunting for multimedia material is not a technological indexing problem alone. We look at interactive ways of engaging with repositories through browsing and relevance feedback, roping in geographical context, and providing visual summaries for videos. The book concludes with an overview of state-of-the-art research projects in the area of multimedia information retrieval, which gives an indication of the research and development trends and, thereby, a glimpse of the future world.

"Estimating the Query Difficulty for Information Retrieval","D. Carmel; E. Yom-Tov","","Estimating the Query Difficulty for Information Retrieval","20140702","2010","","","","","Many information retrieval (IR) systems suffer from a radical variance in performance when responding to users' queries. Even for systems that succeed very well on average, the quality of results returned for some of the queries is poor. Thus, it is desirable that IR systems will be able to identify ""difficult"" queries so they can be handled properly. Understanding why some queries are inherently more difficult than others is essential for IR, and a good answer to this important question will help search engines to reduce the variance in performance, hence better servicing their customer needs. Estimating the query difficulty is an attempt to quantify the quality of search results retrieved for a query from a given collection of documents. This book discusses the reasons that cause search engines to fail for some of the queries, and then reviews recent approaches for estimating query difficulty in the IR field. It then describes a common methodology for evaluating the prediction qual ty of those estimators, and experiments with some of the predictors applied by various IR methods over several TREC benchmarks. Finally, it discusses potential applications that can utilize query difficulty estimators by handling each query individually and selectively, based upon its estimated difficulty.

"Information Retrieval Evaluation","D. Harman","","Information Retrieval Evaluation","20140702","2011","","","","","Evaluation has always played a major role in information retrieval, with the early pioneers such as Cyril Cleverdon and Gerard Salton laying the foundations for most of the evaluation methodologies in use today. The retrieval community has been extremely fortunate to have such a well-grounded evaluation paradigm during a period when most of the human language technologies were just developing. This lecture has the goal of explaining where these evaluation methodologies came from and how they have continued to adapt to the vastly changed environment in the search engine world today. The lecture starts with a discussion of the early evaluation of information retrieval systems, starting with the Cranfield testing in the early 1960s, continuing with the Lancaster ""user"" study for MEDLARS, and presenting the various test collection investigations by the SMART project and by groups in Britain. The emphasis in this chapter is on the how and the why of the various methodologies developed. The second chapter covers the more recent ""batch"" evaluations, examining the methodologies used in the various open evaluation campaigns such as TREC, NTCIR (emphasis on Asian languages), CLEF (emphasis on European languages), INEX (emphasis on semi-structured data), etc. Here again the focus is on the how and why, and in particular on the evolving of the older evaluation methodologies to handle new information access techniques. This includes how the test collection techniques were modified and how the metrics were changed to better reflect operational environments. The final chapters look at evaluation issues in user studies -- the interactive part of information retrieval, including a look at the search log studies mainly done by the commercial search engines. Here the goal is to show, via case studies, how the high-level issues of experimental design affect the final evaluations.

Recently, conditional random fields (CRFs) and hand-coded wrappers have been used to label the text (such as Title, Author Name(s), Affiliation, Email, Contact number, etc. in research papers).

Homosonic segments are first termed in this study, where it refers to audio files which have one or more of the same sonic properties with each other, but do not sound the same acoustically when played due to the limited audio features extracted during the analysis process. These homosonic segments create confusions within the CSS selection engine. This study proposes a robust solution to overcome this issue by introducing the concatenation cost in addition to the regular target cost. The experiment conducted in this study observes that the use of concatenation cost to help solve the problem is feasible. Further evaluation also suggests that the concatenation cost is an effective solution in solving the challenges involving homosonic segments as the sounds synthesised through concatenation cost function have a better accuracy and possess higher fluency when concatenated from one segment to the next.","","CD:978-1-5090-2953-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-2954-9; POD:978-1-5090-2955-6","10.1109/INFRKM.2016.7806331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806331","cocnatenation cost;concatenative sound synthesis;homosonic audio segments","Approximation algorithms;Cascading style sheets;Databases;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Music;Speech synthesis","audio signal processing;feature extraction","CSS system;audio features extraction;audio files;concatenation cost;concatenative sound synthesis;homosonic segments;unit selection","","","","","","","23-24 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, every model of ISB targets a specific audience, but all models have the same purpose i.e., to fulfil the desired informational needs. Hence, in order to understand the similarity and difference between each model, it is necessary to know the generic behaviour of ISB models. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to present existing ISB models and generate the generic phases. As a methodology, created the strategy after observing the ISB models i.e., critical review of ISB model, extract the components of ISB, determine the input and output components of ISB, construct table, matching components (ISB), non-matching components (ISB), rearrange all phases and analyse the flow. This strategy helped to merge the models of ISB and placed the similar components (based on the flow and concept) in one phase and different components in different phases. Hence, the significant of this study is to evaluate the generic phases from the combination of ISB models. That helps to differentiate the importance of ISB models components and has rich practical and theoretical implications, which are discussed in the conclusion.","","CD:978-1-5090-2953-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-2954-9; POD:978-1-5090-2955-6","10.1109/INFRKM.2016.7806348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806348","Information seeking behaviour;components;models;phases","Analytical models;Data mining;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Merging;Psychology;Uncertainty","information needs","ISB models;generic phases;human behaviour;information science;information seeking behaviour;informational needs;library science;nonmatching components;social science","","","","","","","23-24 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Dynamic Information Retrieval Modeling","G. H. Yang; M. Sloan; J. Wang","","Dynamic Information Retrieval Modeling","20160706","2016","","","","","<p> Big data and human-computer information retrieval (HCIR) are changing IR. They capture the dynamic changes in the data and dynamic interactions of users with IR systems. A dynamic system is one which changes or adapts over time or a sequence of events. Many modern IR systems and data exhibit these characteristics which are largely ignored by conventional techniques. What is missing is an ability for the model to change over time and be responsive to stimulus. Documents, relevance, users and tasks all exhibit dynamic behavior that is captured in data sets typically collected over long time spans and models need to respond to these changes. Additionally, the size of modern datasets enforces limits on the amount of learning a system can achieve. Further to this, advances in IR interface, personalization and ad display demand models that can react to users in real time and in an intelligent, contextual way. </p> <p>In this book we provide a comprehensive and up to-date introduction to Dynamic Information Retrieval Modeling, the statistical modeling of IR systems that can adapt to change. We define <i>dynamics</i>, what it means within the context of IR and highlight examples of problems where dynamics play an important role. We cover techniques ranging from classic relevance feedback to the latest applications of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and a handful of useful algorithms and tools for solving IR problems incorporating dynamics. </p> <p>The theoretical component is based around the Markov Decision Process (MDP), a mathematical framework taken from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables us to construct models that change according to sequential inputs. We define the framework and the algorithms commonly used to optimize over it and generalize it to the case where the inputs aren't reliable. We explore the topic of reinforcement learning more broadly and introduce nother tool known as a Multi-Armed Bandit which is useful for cases where exploring model parameters is beneficial. Following this we introduce theories and algorithms which can be used to incorporate dynamics into an IR model before presenting an array of state-of-the-art research that already does, such as in the areas of session search and online advertising. </p> <p>Change is at the heart of modern Information Retrieval systems and this book will help equip the reader with the tools and knowledge needed to understand <i>Dynamic Information Retrieval Modeling</i>. </p>","","97816270552","10.2200/S00718ED1V01Y201605ICR049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=7503460.pdf&bkn=7503459&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","2016","","","","Morgan & Claypool","Morgan and Claypool eBooks"

The question is particularly interesting if there is not a simple, tree-like hierarchy, but when low-level items may belong to several superordinate elements. In this article we propose a solution for this problem following the ideas of O'Connor et al., which are guided by the observation that children learn superordinate concepts from implicitly given information. For the simulation, we use a simple, one-layered RNN consisting of IC units and a very simple learning rule based on teacher forcing. We assume the capability of figure-ground separation as being given. Furthermore, the agent is assumed to owe sensory systems. There are, however, no explicit, preformulated concepts given like `Red'. Further, the agent is assumed to be able to record words. Each object presented to the agent is separately and individually learned and represented in the RNN forming an episodic memory. We show that, using this simple approach, learning and retrieval of hierarchically organized information is possible, although this information is not given explicitly and no hierarchical structure can be found in the network. Learning is very fast. The net shows top-down generalisation and bottom-up activation. Furthermore, asymmetric priming effects can be observed similar to those fond in human subjects. The agent is able to chunk different sensory inputs to represent the same object in memory, but nevertheless being able to distinguish between the different stimuli if, during learning, a supervisor labels the different stimuli with the same name.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4244-6918-5; POD:978-1-4244-6916-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2010.5596804","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5596804","","Color;Cows;Horses;Image color analysis;Recurrent neural networks;Training","brain models;recurrent neural nets","autonomous agent;children;episodic memory;hierarchically organized information;one-layered RNN;recurrent neural networks","","1","","14","","","18-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, the query example is a multi-view(MLO and CC) mass pair instead of the single view mass in the traditional image retrieval framework. In the experiments, several visual features are used for retrieval evaluation. Both distance similarity measures, such as Euclidean distance, and k-NN regression model based non-distance similarity measures are used for comparison.

Although extensive research has been carried out on this integration, however there is a huge challenge on bridging the gaps between natural language used in use case scenario and the mathematics model used in formal model. This is mainly because of the differences in syntax and semantic of these two models. Natural language requirement is well documented that it is being inconsistent, inherently ambiguous, and incomplete even though natural language is universal, widespread, and flexible. As a consequence, it may lead to misunderstanding and produce an incorrect and inaccurate analysis and design model. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a use case formal template and define a new set of mapping rules that is used for formalizing UML use case by transforming use case scenarios which are written in natural language into VDM++ formal specification. The formal verification for the generated VDM++ formal specification can be further conducted by adopting the existing support tool of VDM++ (i.e. VDM++ ToolBox) to verify the correctness of the specification.","","CD:978-1-5090-2953-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-2954-9; POD:978-1-5090-2955-6","10.1109/INFRKM.2016.7806329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806329","Vienna Development Method;formal specification;formal template;integration;mapping rules;use case","Analytical models;Formal specifications;Natural languages;Object oriented modeling;Semantics;Software;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;Vienna development method;formal specification;natural languages;software tools","UML use case;VDM++ formal specification;VDM++ support tool;Vienna development method;formal model;mapping rules;mathematics model;natural language requirement;reliable software model;unified modeling language;use case formal template","","","","","","","23-24 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Information Retrieval Models:Foundations and Relationships","T. Roelleke","","Information Retrieval Models:Foundations and Relationships","20140702","2013","","","","","Information Retrieval (IR) models are a core component of IR research and IR systems. The past decade brought a consolidation of the family of IR models, which by 2000 consisted of relatively isolated views on TF-IDF (Term-Frequency times Inverse-Document-Frequency) as the weighting scheme in the vector-space model (VSM), the probabilistic relevance framework (PRF), the binary independence retrieval (BIR) model, BM25 (Best-Match Version 25, the main instantiation of the PRF/BIR), and language modelling (LM). Also, the early 2000s saw the arrival of divergence from randomness (DFR). Regarding intuition and simplicity, though LM is clear from a probabilistic point of view, several people stated: ""It is easy to understand TF-IDF and BM25. For LM, however, we understand the math, but we do not fully understand why it works."" This book takes a horizontal approach gathering the foundations of TF-IDF, PRF, BIR, Poisson, BM25, LM, probabilistic inference networks (PIN's), and divergence-base models. The aim is to create a consolidated and balanced view on the main models. A particular focus of this book is on the ""relationships between models."" This includes an overview over the main frameworks (PRF, logical IR, VSM, generalized VSM) and a pairing of TF-IDF with other models. It becomes evident that TF-IDF and LM measure the same, namely the dependence (overlap) between document and query. The Poisson probability helps to establish probabilistic, non-heuristic roots for TF-IDF, and the Poisson parameter, average term frequency, is a binding link between several retrieval models and model parameters.

"Cross-Language Information Retrieval","J. Y. Nie","","Cross-Language Information Retrieval","20140702","2010","","","","","Search for information is no longer exclusively limited within the native language of the user, but is more and more extended to other languages. This gives rise to the problem of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), whose goal is to find relevant information written in a different language to a query. In addition to the problems of monolingual information retrieval (IR), translation is the key problem in CLIR: one should translate either the query or the documents from a language to another. However, this translation problem is not identical to full-text machine translation (MT): the goal is not to produce a human-readable translation, but a translation suitable for finding relevant documents. Specific translation methods are thus required. The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive description of the specific problems arising in CLIR, the solutions proposed in this area, as well as the remaining problems. The book starts with a general description of the monolingual IR and CLIR problems. Different classes of approaches to translation are then presented: approaches using an MT system, dictionary-based translation and approaches based on parallel and comparable corpora. In addition, the typical retrieval effectiveness using different approaches is compared. It will be shown that translation approaches specifically designed for CLIR can rival and outperform high-quality MT systems. Finally, the book offers a look into the future that draws a strong parallel between query expansion in monolingual IR and query translation in CLIR, suggesting that many approaches developed in monolingual IR can be adapted to CLIR. The book can be used as an introduction to CLIR. Advanced readers can also find more technical details and discussions about the remaining research challenges in the future. It is suitable to new researchers who intend to carry out research on CLIR.

Information resources are retrieved according to their similarities to this query. Consequently if query is not declared with appropriate terms, retrieved results would not be satisfactory. Therefore query refinement procedures are incorporated to improve the efficiency of the IR systems. In this paper, an active learning approach has been proposed for query expansion (QE) according to user feedbacks. A novel document selection procedure is used to acquire user feedbacks. In this procedure, firstly, the whole set of documents are classified according to existing feedbacks. Then a set of documents which are classified with low certainty and do not produce redundant information are selected as informative documents to get user feedbacks. In this scenario, the number of feedbacks is equal to customary relevance feedback methods but retrieval system would gain more useful information. Experimental results on Reuters-21578 full-text dataset demonstrate considerable improvement in the performance of retrieval system. It is shown experimentally that the proposed method can effectively employ user's feedback in discovering the favorable hidden concepts too.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1090-1; POD:978-1-4673-1091-8","10.1109/InfRKM.2012.6204982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6204982","Batch-Mode Active Learning;Query Expansion;Relevance Feedback;Reuters-21578;Text Classification;Text Retrieval","Computational modeling;Context;Information retrieval;Information services;Radio frequency;Text categorization;Vectors","information resources;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;query processing;relevance feedback;text analysis","IR system;active learning approach;document classification;document selection procedure;information resource;information retrieval system;informative document;query expansion;query refinement procedure;relevance feedback;user feedback","","0","","13","","","13-15 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing:Second Edition","H. Li","","Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing:Second Edition","20141112","2014","","","","","Learning to rank refers to machine learning techniques for training a model in a ranking task. Learning to rank is useful for many applications in information retrieval, natural language processing, and data mining. Intensive studies have been conducted on its problems recently, and significant progress has been made. This lecture gives an introduction to the area including the fundamental problems, major approaches, theories, applications, and future work. The author begins by showing that various ranking problems in information retrieval and natural language processing can be formalized as two basic ranking tasks, namely ranking creation (or simply ranking) and ranking aggregation. In ranking creation, given a request, one wants to generate a ranking list of offerings based on the features derived from the request and the offerings. In ranking aggregation, given a request, as well as a number of ranking lists of offerings, one wants to generate a new ranking list of the offerings. R nking creation (or ranking) is the major problem in learning to rank. It is usually formalized as a supervised learning task. The author gives detailed explanations on learning for ranking creation and ranking aggregation, including training and testing, evaluation, feature creation, and major approaches. Many methods have been proposed for ranking creation. The methods can be categorized as the pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches according to the loss functions they employ. They can also be categorized according to the techniques they employ, such as the SVM based, Boosting based, and Neural Network based approaches. The author also introduces some popular learning to rank methods in details. These include: PRank, OC SVM, McRank, Ranking SVM, IR SVM, GBRank, RankNet, ListNet & ListMLE, AdaRank, SVM MAP, SoftRank, LambdaRank, LambdaMART, Borda Count, Markov Chain, and CRanking. The author explains several example applications of learning to rank including web search, col aborative filtering, definition search, keyphrase extraction, query dependent summarization, and re-ranking in machine translation. A formulation of learning for ranking creation is given in the statistical learning framework. Ongoing and future research directions for learning to rank are also discussed.

Many information retrieval systems for marine science today require text input from user and can only be accessed online. Therefore, people who do not know the name of the marine species or do not have Internet access cannot search using the systems. Responding to this important need, this work aims to develop a Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system for marine invertebrates based on colour and shape features. With the CBIR system for marine invertebrates, users can use the system to look for marine invertebrates' species instead of using traditional methods of searching such as using books and encyclopedias. Users can easily upload the image of marine invertebrate that they want to search into the system and the system will retrieve all the other similar images of marine invertebrates along with their description. All the system interface's buttons, icons and text were designed in a way where any user can easily understand and further learn to operate the system themselves. Based on the retrieval effectiveness experiment and questionnaire-based survey, the proposed CBIR system for marine invertebrates is shown to be effective, help users search similar images of marine invertebrates, provide concise information on marine invertebrate's species for learning purposes, and is reliable and user-friendly.","","CD:978-1-5090-2953-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-2954-9; POD:978-1-5090-2955-6","10.1109/INFRKM.2016.7806338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806338","Content-based Image Retrieval;colour feature;marine invertebrates;shape feature","Databases;Detectors;Feature extraction;Fish;Image color analysis;Image edge detection;Shape","biology computing;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image retrieval;shape recognition","CBIR system;colour features;content-based image retrieval system;information retrieval systems;marine invertebrate image;marine science;marine species;shape features","","","","","","","23-24 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A simpler approach is presented to identify and classify the boundaries in prosodic phrasing using pitch and intensity patterns and pause duration on Malay speech sentences. We also propose a listening test that allows trained listener to classify the boundaries as minor or major breaks. This cheaper and faster approach is proven useful for under-resource language such as Malay which do not have comprehensive prosodic-annotated corpus. Word-related pitch, intensity and duration features are extracted from the targeted sentence and phrase breaks. A speech corpus is developed from targeted breaks of 100 speech sentences evaluated in the listening test. Instead of labeling the phrase break using linguistic and phonetic meaning, the proposed listening test allows labeling of phrase break as perceived by listener. In addition, the results can be used as preliminary information for evaluation of boundary saliency at the targeted boundary locations.","","CD:978-1-5090-2953-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-2954-9; POD:978-1-5090-2955-6","10.1109/INFRKM.2016.7806332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806332","phrase boundary detection;phrase breaks;phrase strength;speech energy","Acoustics;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Labeling;Speech;Speech recognition","feature extraction;natural language processing;speech processing","Malay speech corpus;Malay speech sentences;duration feature extraction;intensity feature extraction;intensity patterns;lengthy spontaneous speech segment;linguistic meaning;listening test;major breaks;minor breaks;pause duration;phonetic meaning;phrase breaks;pitch patterns;prosodic phrasing;sentence breaks;speech sentence breaks;under-resource language;word-related pitch","","","","","","","23-24 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By searching the exemplar region which mostly matches the query image, the system can annotate the query image with geo-information provided by the matched exemplar image.

In this paper, a new parallel LSI algorithm which runs on standard multi-core personal computer (PC) is proposed to improve the performance of retrieving relevant documents. The parallel LSI algorithm uses parallel threads to automatically perform the matrix computations using the Fork-Join approach. 2028 text documents extracted from four volumes of the Malay-translated book of Hadith known as Shahih Bukhari were used as the test collections. We compare the time to process LSI space between both sequential and parallel systems. The percentage of recall, precision and effectiveness for retrieving relevant document are also measured for both systems using the Information Retrieval (IR) metrics which are recall, precision, and effectiveness. The results show that the time taken to create LSI space for parallel system is faster than sequential system.

The ImageCLEF medical image retrieval task is an international benchmark that enables researchers to assess and compare techniques for medical image retrieval using standard test collections. Although text retrieval is mature and well researched, it is limited by the quality and availability of the annotations associated with the images. Advances in computer vision have led to methods for using the image itself as search entity. However, the success of purely content-based techniques has been limited and these systems have not had much clinical success. On the other hand a combination of text- and content-based retrieval can achieve improved retrieval performance if combined effectively. Combining visual and textual runs is not trivial based on experience in ImageCLEF. The goal of the fusion challenge at ICPR is to encourage participants to combine visual and textual results to improve search performance. Participants were provided textual and visual runs, as well as the results of the manual judgments from ImageCLEFmed 2008 as training data. The goal was to combine textual and visual runs from 2009.

Even though the information is maintained and distributed by different owners, systems, formats and locations, their contents might tell the same story, share the same space-time extension, and they might be closely related to each other. Previous efforts in information retrieval and integration have been limited to classical keyword-based and content-based indexing and querying for multiple media documents. Furthermore, the concept-based approach, which is becoming a very popular method, still focuses on specific single media documents. Thus, a concept-based system architecture that allows access to information in multiple format - text, image and graphic, audio, video and spatial information - within heterogeneous sources is presented in this paper. This architecture conforms to the Service Oriented Architecture standards and is designed with the use of ontologies in order to comprehend the semantic matchmaking between users' queries and multi-format information through metadata. The basis of the ontology model is already in place, but the architecture still undergoes its incremental progress as a research prototype within the disaster management domain.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1090-1; POD:978-1-4673-1091-8","10.1109/InfRKM.2012.6204994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6204994","Ontology-based;disaster management;information retrieval;multimedia documents;spatial documents","Disaster management;Information retrieval;Media;Multimedia communication;Ontologies;Semantics;Web services","content-based retrieval;disasters;document handling;indexing;information dissemination;meta data;multimedia computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);service-oriented architecture","ICT;concept-based system architecture;content-based indexing;digital media object;disaster management;heterogeneous sources;information dissemination;information retrieval;keyword-based indexing;media document query;metadata;multiformat information access;ontology-based architecture;semantic matchmaking;service oriented architecture;space-time extension;user query","","1","","31","","","13-15 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing metrics evaluate pairwise shot similarity based only on shot perceptual content, which is denoted as content-based similarity. In this study, our concern is to recognize and detect video events that are “semantically similar”. Thus, we extend the content-based similarity to measure the conceptual content of shots. Here, conceptual content refers to the dynamic semantic concept which reflects a “human-action” regardless the perceptual/visual appearance. In addition, we propose a new similarity metric to make use of the shot contexts in video clips collection. The context of a shot is built by constructing a vector with each dimension representing the content similarity between the shot and any shot in the video collection. The context similarity between two videos is obtained by computing the similarity between the corresponding context vectors using the vector similarity functions. Furthermore, a linear and nonlinear fusion schemes are introduced to compute the relative contributions of each similarity in the overall retrieval and classification process. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of the context similarity can significantly improve the retrieval performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6893-5; POD:978-1-4244-6892-8","10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555715","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5555715","Content;Context;Retrieval;Similarity Measures","Computational modeling;Computer vision;Context;Humans;Image motion analysis;Image resolution;Measurement","content-based retrieval;image classification;sensor fusion;video retrieval","content based video retrieval;content information fusion;context information fusion;vector similarity functions;video classification","","0","","16","","","5-7 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, understanding the factors that affect the reliability of crowd sourcing is crucial. Using crowdsourcing has recently proposed as an alternative to create relevance judgments for the evaluation of information retrieval systems as traditional methods are expensive and scale poorly. The aim of this study is to measure selected cognitive ability (general reasoning skill) of crowdsourced workers, and investigate the effect that this characteristic has upon judgment reliability, as measured against a human gold standard. A significant correlation was found between judgment reliability and measured general reasoning skill.

"Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing","H. Li","","Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing","20140702","2011","","","","","Learning to rank refers to machine learning techniques for training the model in a ranking task. Learning to rank is useful for many applications in information retrieval, natural language processing, and data mining. Intensive studies have been conducted on the problem recently and significant progress has been made. This lecture gives an introduction to the area including the fundamental problems, existing approaches, theories, applications, and future work. The author begins by showing that various ranking problems in information retrieval and natural language processing can be formalized as two basic ranking tasks, namely ranking creation (or simply ranking) and ranking aggregation. In ranking creation, given a request, one wants to generate a ranking list of offerings based on the features derived from the request and the offerings. In ranking aggregation, given a request, as well as a number of ranking lists of offerings, one wants to generate a new ranking list of the offerings Ranking creation (or ranking) is the major problem in learning to rank. It is usually formalized as a supervised learning task. The author gives detailed explanations on learning for ranking creation and ranking aggregation, including training and testing, evaluation, feature creation, and major approaches. Many methods have been proposed for ranking creation. The methods can be categorized as the pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches according to the loss functions they employ. They can also be categorized according to the techniques they employ, such as the SVM based, Boosting SVM, Neural Network based approaches. The author also introduces some popular learning to rank methods in details. These include PRank, OC SVM, Ranking SVM, IR SVM, GBRank, RankNet, LambdaRank, ListNet & ListMLE, AdaRank, SVM MAP, SoftRank, Borda Count, Markov Chain, and CRanking. The author explains several example applications of learning to rank including web search, collaborative filtering, de inition search, keyphrase extraction, query dependent summarization, and re-ranking in machine translation. A formulation of learning for ranking creation is given in the statistical learning framework. Ongoing and future research directions for learning to rank are also discussed.

Researchers confirm that in many cases outliers in one class in cancer microarray based-experiments are contaminated. As a result, outliers appear to have gene expression similar to samples of an existing class in the dataset. Hence, it is essential to analyze each class in the dataset independently from other classes. Existing outlier detection algorithms identify outliers with respect to the whole dataset. Our algorithm isolates detected classes and analyzes each class as a separate dataset. We propose a novel, simple and biologically inspired algorithm to detect outliers in cancer microarray data. This algorithm is inspired from the natural phenomena of bird flocking. We model microarray gene expression data as an artificial life where similar samples flock in a virtual space to form swarms and outliers' samples are being naturally repulsed by optimum subswarms. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm detects biologically meaningful outlier samples. We analyze the performance of the algorithm using real colon cancer dataset widely used in the bioinformatics literature.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1090-1; POD:978-1-4673-1091-8","10.1109/InfRKM.2012.6204996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6204996","bioinformatics;computational intelligence;gene expression;information retrieval;microarray;pattern clustering;swarm intelligence","Birds;Cancer;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Gene expression;Muscles;Vectors","artificial life;bioinformatics;cancer;data mining;information retrieval;lab-on-a-chip","artificial life;bioinformatics literature;biologically inspired algorithm;bird flocking;cancer gene expression microarray data;cancer gene expression microarray-based experiments;flocking-based data mining algorithm;natural phenomena;optimum subswarms;outlier samples;outliers detection;real colon cancer dataset;virtual space","","1","","21","","","13-15 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Statistical Language Models for Information Retrieval","C. Zhai","","Statistical Language Models for Information Retrieval","20140702","2009","","","","","As online information grows dramatically, search engines such as Google are playing a more and more important role in our lives. Critical to all search engines is the problem of designing an effective retrieval model that can rank documents accurately for a given query. This has been a central research problem in information retrieval for several decades. In the past ten years, a new generation of retrieval models, often referred to as statistical language models, has been successfully applied to solve many different information retrieval problems. Compared with the traditional models such as the vector space model, these new models have a more sound statistical foundation and can leverage statistical estimation to optimize retrieval parameters. They can also be more easily adapted to model non-traditional and complex retrieval problems. Empirically, they tend to achieve comparable or better performance than a traditional model with less effort on parameter tuning. This book systemati ally reviews the large body of literature on applying statistical language models to information retrieval with an emphasis on the underlying principles, empirically effective language models, and language models developed for non-traditional retrieval tasks. All the relevant literature has been synthesized to make it easy for a reader to digest the research progress achieved so far and see the frontier of research in this area. The book also offers practitioners an informative introduction to a set of practically useful language models that can effectively solve a variety of retrieval problems. No prior knowledge about information retrieval is required, but some basic knowledge about probability and statistics would be useful for fully digesting all the details.

Xu","","Polarimetric Scattering and SAR Information Retrieval","20130522","2013","","","167","214","Chapter 5 introduces the radar polarimetry and target decomposition. The de-orientation theory for surface classification of POL-SAR image is presented. The parameterized model of random non-spherical scatter media and its Mueller matrix solution for de-orientation validation are developed. A new set of the parameters of polarimetric scattering targets is defined for describing target orientation, orderly or randomly, and scatter surface classification. A classification spectrum of terrain surface is presented.","","97811181881","10.1002/9781118188149.ch5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6517042.pdf&bkn=6515224&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","2013","","","","Wiley-IEEE Press","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Nodes follow a pure peer-to-peer approach (i.e., without the intervention of servers), thus requiring an efficient query/response propagation algorithm to prevent network congestion. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal of a novel solution, called Eureka, that identifies the regions of the network where the required information is more likely to be stored and steers the queries toward those regions. To discriminate among regions, the concept of information density is introduced, along with a procedure that allows nodes its estimation. Eureka does not require the use of satellite positioning systems, and proves to be very effective in both vehicular and pedestrian environments.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2008.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4586375","Communication/Networking and Information Technology;Comp;Computer Systems Organization;Mobile Computing;Mobile communication systems;Wireless communication","","ad hoc networks;mobile radio","Eureka;MANET;content retrieval;efficient query-response propagation algorithm;information density estimation;mobile ad hoc networks;peer-to-peer approach;satellite positioning systems;wireless ad hoc networks","","4","1","16","","20080801","March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
