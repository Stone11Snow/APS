In this way, Web data content is associated at run-time with different services and presentation manifests, according to the context and the environment it is invoked and used in.

Multi-angular remote sensing data provide more information for canopy structure. This paper presents a method to estimate LAI using multi-angular data and model inversion method. The airborne multi-angular data were acquired by AMTIS (Airborne Multi-angle TIR/VNIR Imaging System), which was a prototype sensor designed by the Institute of Remote Sensing Applications of Chinese Academy of Science. Our study is based on two datasets: one was acquired in Beijing Shunyi in April 11, and the major crop is sparse winter wheat; another was acquired in Haerbin in August 24, and major crops are dense corn and soybean. Both datasets have been geometrically atmospherically corrected. Ground based measurements were carried out during the flight experiment. SAIL model is chosen to predict reflected radiance of a presumed LAI. Various view angles relate to the different components ratio in view field, and the reflected radiance is different accordingly. Hence, a certain LAI value was given, SAIL model predicts a set of reflected radiances of various angles. We compare the model predict radiance with the radiance viewed by an multi-angular sensor, to find the optimized LAI which can make the radiance predicted by the model be closest to the viewed radiance, then take this LAI value as the right value","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1370146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1370146","","Crops;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Land surface;MODIS;Predictive models;Reflectivity;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Vegetation mapping","airborne radar;crops;geophysical signal processing;infrared imaging;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;vegetation mapping","AD 04 11;AD 08 24;AMTIS;Airborne Multiangle TIR-VNIR Imaging System;Beijing Shunyi;Chinese Academy of Science;Haerbin;Institute of Remote Sensing Applications;NDVI-LAI relation;Normalized Difference Vegetation Index;SAIL model;SR-LAI relation;TM data;Thematic Mapper data;airborne multiangular data;canopy structure information;crops LAI estimation;dense corn;flight experiment;geometric atmospheric correction;ground based measurement;model inversion method;multiangular remote sensing data;near infrared imaging system;prototype sensor;reflected radiance;simple ratio-Leaf Area Index relation;soybean;sparse winter wheat;thermal infrared-visible imaging system","","0","","3","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such studies typically use extensive in-situ measurements and empirical data fitting (usually correlations) to retrieve concentrations of the water constituent under investigation. One disadvantage of such empirically derived algorithms is that they tend to be applicable only to the water constituent, the particular location and water type investigated. In addition, the atmospheric effects are either not taken into account or a uniform atmosphere is assumed. On the other hand, the backscattering and absorption coefficients, have been shown to determine the water color and hence, the measured reflectance. We report on our attempt to retrieve these inherent optical properties from Landsat ETM+ data. We show how we can correct for the atmospheric effects using Band 4. Using current ocean color models, we retrieved the backscattering and absorption coefficients from Bands 1, 2 and 3 for the coastal waters around Singapore. The derived backscattering and absorption coefficients are within the range of values retrieved using Hyperion data and those from in-situ measurements. The advantage of this method is that minimal empirical data are needed and so it can be easily applied to other similar data sets. However, the precision of the retrieved coefficients is necessarily coarse.","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1370459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1370459","","Absorption;Atmosphere;Atmospheric measurements;Backscatter;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Remote sensing;Satellites;Sea measurements;Water","data acquisition;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;seawater","Hyperion data;Landsat ETM+ data;Landsat TM images;Singapore coastal waters;absorption coefficient;atmospheric effects;backscattering coefficient;chlorophyll concentration;current ocean color model;data fitting;ocean optics;optical property retrieval;suspended matter concentration;water color;water quality;water reflectance","","3","","9","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this scenario, similarity and fuzzy techniques have proven to be successful principles for effective data retrieval. However, most proposals are domain specific and lack of a general and integrated approach to deal with generalized complex queries, i.e., queries where multiple conditions are expressed, possibly on complex as well as on traditional data. To overcome such limitations, much work has been devoted to the development of middleware systems to support query processing on multiple repositories. On a similar line, We present a formal framework to permeate complex similarity and fuzzy queries within a relational database system. As an example, we focus on multimedia data, which is represented in an integrated view with common database data. We have designed an application layer that relies on an algebraic query language, extended with MM-tailored operators, and that maps complex similarity and fuzzy queries to standard SQL statements that can be processed by a relational database system, exploiting standard facilities of modern extensible RDBMS. To show the applicability of our proposal, we implemented a prototype that provides the user with rich query capabilities, ranging from traditional database queries to complex queries gathering a mixture of Boolean, similarity, and fuzzy predicates on the data.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377176","","Bioinformatics;Database languages;Fuzzy systems;Genomics;Information retrieval;Middleware;Multimedia databases;Proposals;Query processing;Relational databases","Boolean algebra;SQL;data mining;data warehouses;fuzzy logic;middleware;multimedia databases;query processing;relational databases;rewriting systems","MM-tailored operators;SQL statements;algebraic query language;complex similarity;data repositories;fuzzy predicates;fuzzy queries;middleware systems;multimedia database;query processing;relational database system;rewriting rules","","6","","41","","","Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

About 3 terabytes of data are collected daily and transmitted to Earth receiving stations. The data exploitation and dissemination methods have not kept pace with the huge data acquisition rate. The products distributed by the agencies are often not in a readily usable form by the nonscience community, and need further processing at the user level. The lack of content and semantic based interactive information searching and retrieval capabilities from the archives is another important issue to be addressed in this context. We propose a framework based on a concept-based model using domain-dependant ontologies where the basic concepts of the domain are identified first and generalized later depending upon the level of reasoning required for executing a particular query. We employ an unsupervised segmentation algorithm to extract homogeneous regions and calculate primitive descriptors for each region based on color, texture and shape. The primitive descriptors are described quantitatively by middle level object ontology. The learning phase is applied at this stage. It associates the middle level descriptors to the concepts in the higher-level ontology by means of a nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) method. These associations are grouped into models specific to a semantic class and used for querying. Also interactive querying is provided by means of a region based relevance feedback method. A methodology to execute complex queries by the integration of an inference engine is discussed. We also intend to extend the system to carry out data exploratory tasks in a peer-to-peer environment.","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1368973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1368973","","Artificial satellites;Content based retrieval;Data acquisition;Earth;Information retrieval;NASA;Ontologies;Satellite ground stations;Shape;Support vector machines","data acquisition;data mining;inference mechanisms;information dissemination;information retrieval systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing;query processing;remote sensing;semantic networks;support vector machines;unsupervised learning","AD 2003 04;Earth observation data archive;Earth observation satellite;Earth receiving stations;NASA;SVM method;color;concept-based model;data acquisition rate;data dissemination method;data exploitation;domain-dependant ontology;feedback method;higher-level ontology;homogeneous regions extraction;inference engine integration;interactive querying;knowledge mining;learning phase;middle level object ontology;nonlinear support vector machine;nonscience community;ontology perspective;peer-to-peer environment;primitive descriptor;query reasoning;searching/retrieval capability;semantic based interactive information;semantic class;sensors;shape;texture;unsupervised segmentation algorithm","","9","","22","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Snow measurements were made along an approximately 500 km transect across Northern Manitoba, Canada, during late November 2003 and early March 2004. Both snow surveys revealed strong agreement between Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) derived passive microwave SWE retrievals (using the Meteorological Service of Canada algorithm suite) and in situ measurements across the northern boreal forest: a gradient of increasing SWE between Thompson and Gillam was evident, as was a well defined zone of high SWE values to the north and east of Gillam. Further to the north, SSM/I derived SWE retrievals over the open tundra were anomalously low.

To remedy this, we explore in this paper several cache retrieval schemes to improve the efficiency of cache retrieval. In particular, we analyze the impact of using a coordinator buffer to improve the overall performance of cache retrieval. Moreover, in light of the properties of transactions (i.e., temporal locality of data access among transactions), we devise a Dynamic and Adaptive cache Retrieval scheme (DAR) that can utilize proper cache methods according to some specific criteria to deal with the service handoff situation in a mobile computing environment. Performance of these cache retrieval schemes is analyzed and a system simulator is developed to validate our results. We devise a systematic procedure for determining the optimal operating points of DAR.

Even a single image can demonstrate evidence of dynamic activity. The ability to classify events from one or more images provides a foundation for ultimately extending the capabilities for feature extraction based on real-world happenings. This ability improves a user's knowledge base and provides insights into a range of possible events that are associated with an image including evidence of unexpected or novel events. In this paper, we describe the requirements for ontologies that support images containing events. Images, as snapshots of dynamic occurrences, require extended ontologies that include event classes and relations. Semantics associated with events give rise to a categorization of image events that can augment image ontology as well as serve as a foundation for event-based querying of images. Categories of image events include: activity-based events, such as blocking and facilitating events; events that are initiating or terminating; events that relate to changes experienced by objects, including appearance, disappearance, and metamorphose events, as well as unexpected events.","","POD:0-7695-2217-3","10.1109/MMSE.2004.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1376704","","Feature extraction;Image analysis;Image retrieval;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Lakes;Object detection;Ontologies;Shape;Spatiotemporal phenomena","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image classification;image retrieval;visual databases","automated features extraction;content-based retrieval;event-based semantic retrieval;image classification;image retrieval;ontology","","2","","28","","","13-15 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, we have used both sensors 1:0 retrieve the chlorophyll concentration, in a scheme of multisensor data assimilation. In fact, the new generation sensor MERIS, on ESA's ENVISAT, with its spatial resolution of 300 meters and 3 days revisitation time, offers a high number of narrow spectral bands in the visible and in the IR. At the same time, MODIS, on NASA's Terra and Aqua Satellites, has a lower space resolution but an higher number of bands in the IR portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and can improve our atmospheric correction algorithms. Due to the high variability of the aerosol (type and concentration) and the water type, an accurate atmospheric correction method based on the 6S radiative transfer code has been performed. The atmospheric data required as input to the 6S code have been retrieved from the MODIS data. The estimated chlorophyll-a concentration has been computed from MERIS and MODIS data using a semi-analytic model, based on the optical properties of water and its components. To validate the inversion procedure, ground measurements have been collected monthly during the year 2003 and have been compared with the values derived from the inversion model.","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369907","","Aerodynamics;Biosensors;Data assimilation;Information retrieval;Infrared sensors;MODIS;Reflectivity;Sea measurements;Spatial resolution;Water","atmospheric precipitation;data assimilation;infrared imaging;inverse problems;oceanographic techniques;radiative transfer;remote sensing;seawater","6S radiative transfer code;AD 2003;Aqua Satellite;ESA ENVISAT;Italy;MERIS data;MODIS data;NASA;Terra Satellite;aerosol;atmospheric correction;biophysical properties;calibrated geolocated reflectance data;chlorophyll-a concentration measurement;coastal waters;coastal zone shallow waters;data inversion;electromagnetic spectrum;infrared spectral band;inversion model;multisensor data assimilation;semianalytic model;space resolution;temporal dynamics;visible spectral band;water optical property;water type","","1","","8","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nowadays search engines provide amazing capabilities of searching resources on the Web though they are still based on text indexing and seldom exploit semantics of resource content. Therefore they sometimes fail on the identification of query context, providing results that are not relevant with respect to user needs; this is especially true for nontrained users. The semantic Web specifically addresses such an issue by providing means to define resources and query semantics using ontologies and semantic annotations. We propose a concept-based search paradigm for document retrieval. We define a new representation of the involved information space, introducing the notion of conceptual spectrum to identify the global topic landscape of Web resources and queries. We exploit such a representation to design and implement a prototypical version of a concept-based search engine.

In other words, the cursed spaces resists indexing. Current research tends to alleviate this particular situation, since easy spaces can be indexed neatly. A recent hypothesis establishes that it is just a fraction of the database which is resilient to indexing, and the proper approach would be to index each part separately. This is precisely the approach of this work. We use two different techniques for indexing complementary parts of a metric database. The dynamic spatial approximation tree (dsa-tree) is a recently proposed data structure for searching in metric spaces. It has been shown that it compares favorably against alternative data structures in spaces of high dimension or queries with low selectivity On the other hand, pivot-based algorithms are effective tools for proximity searching in any metric spaces, if sufficient storage space is available.

We view the work as a step toward high-level semantic film interpretation, currently using low-level video features and knowledge of ubiquitous cinematic practices. Our current domain of study is the movie preview, commercial advertisements primarily created to attract audiences. A preview often emphasizes the theme of a film and hence provides suitable information for classification. In our approach, we classify movies into four broad categories: Comedies, Action, Dramas, or Horror films. Inspired by cinematic principles, four computable video features (average shot length, color variance, motion content and lighting key) are combined in a framework to provide a mapping to these four high-level semantic classes. Mean shift classification is used to discover the structure between the computed features and each film genre. We have conducted extensive experiments on over a hundred film previews and notably demonstrate that low-level visual features (without the use of audio or text cues) may be utilized for movie classification. Our approach can also be broadened for many potential applications including scene understanding, the building and updating of video databases with minimal human intervention, browsing, and retrieval of videos on the Internet (video-on-demand) and video libraries.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2004.839993","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377360","High-key;low-key;movie genres;previews;shot length;video-on-demand","Conductive films;Humans;Information retrieval;Internet;Layout;Libraries;Motion pictures;Pervasive computing;Spatial databases;Visual databases","cinematography;classification","action film;comedy film;computable video feature;drama film;film classification;horror film;mean shift classification;movie classification;movie genre;semantic film interpretation;video database;video-on-demand","","63","3","31","","","Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the deep gap between low-level features and high-level semantics concepts is a major obstacle to more effective image retrieval. Therefore, a semantics-based retrieval approach was implemented. The semantics classifiers are trained using heterogeneous features from a group of satellite images. The proposed approach is mainly composed of two steps. The first step is to form hierarchical semantics classifiers based on the low-level features of the training images. In the second step, unknown satellite images are classified into a certain semantics class if their feature vectors are located in the corresponding feature space. To achieve an effective and at the same time efficient identification of the multiple semantics classes within the satellite scenes, an approximation approach was developed.

WiSAR can be applied to SAR data acquired in C-band at either vertical (VV) or horizontal (HH) polarization in transmit and receive from the European satellites ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT as well as the Canadian satellite RADARSAT-1. SAR wind field retrieval is a two step process. In the first step wind directions are extracted from wind induced streaks that are visible in the SAR images at scales above 200 m and that are assumed to be approximately in line with the mean surface wind direction. The orientations of these streaks are derived by a method based on investigation of local gradients of the SAR intensity image. The SAR retrieved wind directions are used in the second step, where wind speeds are derived from the normalized radar cross sections of the SAR data under consideration of the wind direction and local SAR imaging geometry. Therefore, the empirical model CMOD4, is used, which was developed for the C-band VV polarized scatterometer aboard ERS-1/2. CMOD4 has been extended to HH polarization considering the polarization ratio and its dependency on incidence angle. To show WiSARs applicability it is applied to a set of 32 ENVISAT ASAR data from the North Sea. The resulting wind fields are compared to the results of the operational numerical model of the German Weather Service.","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1368940","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1368940","","Data mining;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Oceans;Polarization;Radar cross section;Satellites;Sea surface;Synthetic aperture radar;Wind speed","atmospheric techniques;oceanographic regions;radar cross-sections;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;wind","Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar;C-band VV polarized scatterometer;Canadian RADARSAT-1 satellite;ENVISAT ASAR data;ERS-1/2 satellite;Environmental Satellite;European ENVISAT satellite;European Remote Sensing-1/2 satellite;German Weather Service;HH polarization ratio;NRCS;North Sea;SAR intensity image;empirical CMOD4 model;high-resolution ocean surface wind field;mean surface wind direction;normalized radar cross section;operational SAR wind field retrieval algorithm;operational algorithm WiSAR;satellite borne synthetic aperture radar;vertical/horizonal polarization;wind induced streak;wind speed","","2","","12","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Aerosol retrievals at 532 nm for the current GLAS and upcoming CALIPSO satellite lidar missions employ/can employ a look-up table approach to select climatologically based S<sub>a</sub> model values for these retrievals when alternate, less uncertain methods for either defining S <sub>a</sub> or providing the needed auxiliary information are unavailable. This paper addresses a revised table look-up approach that incorporates two notable revisions for improved S<sub>a</sub> selection which, as a consequence, enable more bounded aerosol retrievals. One is a refined, more bounded set of S<sub>a</sub> values, both for 532 nm and 1064 nm, representative of a definitive set of aerosol types/models determined from an extensive analysis of the global aerosol solar radiometer network, AERONET, data base. The other is an accompanying set of key spectral ratio parameters (i.e., dual wavelength, 532 nm to 1064 nm, ratios of backscatter, extinction and S<sub>a</sub>) also derived from the AERONET data which offer additional ways to bound the lidar aerosol retrievals. Thus, aerosol retrievals can be obtained subject to the constraints that the lidar data yield retrievals with spectral ratio parameters consistent with a given aerosol model (or models), to confirm the model choice and better bound the retrievals.

XML documents can be compared as to their structural similarity, in order to group them into clusters so that different storage, retrieval, and processing techniques can be effectively exploited. In this scenario, an efficient and effective similarity function is the key of a successful data management process. We present an approach for detecting structural similarity between XML documents which significantly differs from standard methods based on graph-matching algorithms, and allows a significant reduction of the required computation costs. Our proposal roughly consists of linearizing the structure of each XML document, by representing it as a numerical sequence and, then, comparing such sequences through the analysis of their frequencies. First, some basic strategies for encoding a document are proposed, which can focus on diverse structural facets. Moreover, the theory of discrete Fourier transform is exploited to effectively and efficiently compare the encoded documents (i.e., signals) in the domain of frequencies. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the approach, also in comparison with standard methods.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377169","","Computational efficiency;Data mining;Discrete Fourier transforms;Encoding;Frequency;Helium;Information retrieval;Resource description framework;Text mining;XML","Internet;XML;data mining;data structures;discrete Fourier transforms;document handling;graph theory;information retrieval","RDF;Web mining;XML document;XML structural similarity;XSL;data management;discrete Fourier transform;graph-matching algorithm;information processing technique;information retrieval;information storage;semistructured data;text mining","","51","5","28","","","Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Though scientists have been realizing that the inversion result is much concerned with sensitivities of parameters, how to define the sensitivity of a parameter in inversion is still under discussion. In this paper, an ""S Index"" is proposed to derive S Ratio, a ratio of one input parameter's S Index to the sum of all other S Indices, as a useful sensitivity criterion. Moreover, we analyzed S index and S Ratio based on the information transfer theory. It is shown that S Ratio is related with information distribution ratio in inversion. The value of S Ratio may vary with different ground covers, soil types, moisture, geometries and bands. We took SAIL model as an example to illustrate the use of S Ratio under several typical scenes. Multi-angular datasets were generated for these scenes and further been used to retrieve 7 parameters of the model. The results suggest that the inversion accuracy is strongly correlated to S Ratio. Another two sensitivity indices are also demonstrated as a comparison. As a result, we could use it to estimate the sensitivity of parameters in a certain inversion step and which type of datasets is better for inversion under various cases.

To do so, we make use of soft computing tools: fuzzy logic is considered for representation and inference purposes by dealing with the extended Boolean query structure, and multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are applied to build the persistent fuzzy query.

It depends largely on the composition, roughness, and other physical parameters of the surface. The knowledge of surface emissivity permits discrimination and sometimes identification of different types of surfaces. The largest area of mountainous permafrost is on the Tibet plateau across the world, except the polar regions. Cloud free thermal infrared (TIR) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra satellite in early winter (Beijing time: Oct.20, 2001, 14:46:25) were chosen to retrieve the surface emissivity on the Tibet plateau by employing a spectral method (the emissivity normalization, NOR).

The results are rigorously consistent with field survey.

A large amount of efforts have been spent in developing efficient techniques for storing, querying, indexing and accessing XML documents. In This work we propose a new approach to clustering XML data. In contrast to previous work, which focused on documents defined by different DTDs, the proposed method works for documents with the same DTD. Our approach is to extract features from documents, modeled by ordered labeled trees, and transform the documents to vectors in a high-dimensional Euclidean space based on the occurrences of the features in the documents. We then reduce the dimensionality of the vectors by principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster the vectors in the reduced dimensional space. The PCA enables one to identify vectors with co-occurrent features, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the clustering. Experimental results based on documents obtained from Wisconsin's XML data bank show the effectiveness and good performance of the proposed techniques.","1082-3409;10823409","POD:0-7695-2236-X","10.1109/ICTAI.2004.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374250","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data mining;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Filters;Information management;Information retrieval;Principal component analysis;XML","XML;data mining;pattern clustering;principal component analysis","DTD;XML clustering;co-occurrent features;data exchange;document management;high-dimensional Euclidean space;information management;principal component analysis","","3","","17","","","15-17 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensors are assumed to be informed with a global message and some nodes are misinformed with random messages. The multiple access channel is i.i.d. fading and the realization of the channel state is known to the access point only. An achievable rate is derived for the information retrieval process when multiple sensors are activated at a time. For a Gaussian multiple access channel under a total network power constraint, the optimal number of simultaneous transmissions is investigated under three fading scenarios: non-fading, unit-gain, and Rayleigh-fading.

The WindSat radiometer has five operating frequencies at 6.8, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8 and 37 GHz, with the 10.7, 18.7, and 37 GHz channels providing fully polarimetric signals. The primary mission of Coriolis is to exploit the unique information provided by WindSat's polarimetric capabilities to retrieve the complete ocean surface wind vector (speed and direction), though the retrieval of numerous other environmental parameters is being actively pursued as well. As part of a pre-NPOESS risk reduction effort, the NOAA/NESDIS/Office of Research and Applications has been collaborating with the Naval Research Laboratory's Remote Sensing Division in the calibration/validation of WindSat in preparation for the release of WindSat data products to the scientific and operational communities. An extensive overview is presented of the WindSat calibration/validation effort being put forth at NOAA/NESDIS and the associated comparison databases constructed for that purpose. These databases include data of WindSat measurements collocated with measurements from oceanographic buoys, ships, other satellites, and global data assimilation models. The strengths and limitations of these various datasets will be discussed in detail. This includes a synopsis of the colocation strategies used in matchup database construction for comparing WindSat measurements with other satellite based measurements, focusing particularly on similar orbit SSM/I data and its use in brightness temperature calibration. In addition, the use of NCEP's Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) as a powerful source of plentiful comparison data is explored, particularly with regard to WindSat model function development","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369043","","Calibration;Data assimilation;Databases;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Instruments;Laboratories;Particle measurements;Satellite broadcasting;Sea measurements","oceanography;polarimetry;radiometry;remote sensing;reviews;ships;wind","10.7 GHz;18.7 GHz;23.8 GHz;37 GHz;6.8 GHz;AD 2003 01 6;GDAS;Global Data Assimilation System;NCEP;NOAA/NESDIS/Office of Research and Applications;National Centers for Environmental Prediction;National Environmental Satellite Data and Information System;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System;Naval Research Laboratory satellite Coriolis;Remote Sensing Division;Special Sensor Microwave Imager;WindSat radiometer;WindSat validation dataset;brightness temperature calibration;environmental parameter;ocean surface wind vector;oceanographic buoys;orbit SSM/I data;polarimetric microwave measurement;pre-NPOESS risk reduction effort;satellites-global data assimilation model;scientific-operational community;ships","","4","","3","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud cover, which curtails retrievals, and the presence of ephemeral and seasonal snow limit the snow-free data to approximately half the global land surfaces on an annual equal-angle basis. This precludes the MOD43B3 albedo products from being used in some remote sensing and ground-based applications, climate models, and global change research projects. An ecosystem-dependent temporal interpolation technique is described that has been developed to fill missing or seasonally snow-covered data in the official MOD43B3 albedo product. The method imposes pixel-level and local regional ecosystem-dependent phenological behavior onto retrieved pixel temporal data in such a way as to maintain pixel-level spatial and spectral detail and integrity. The phenological curves are derived from statistics based on the MODIS MOD12Q1 IGBP land cover classification product geolocated with the MOD43B3 data. The resulting snow-free value-added products provide the scientific community with spatially and temporally complete global white- and black-sky surface albedo maps and statistics. These products are stored on 1-min and coarser resolution equal-angle grids and are computed for the first seven MODIS wavelengths, ranging from 0.47-2.1 μm and for three broadband wavelengths 0.3-0.7, 0.3-5.0, and 0.7-5.0 μm.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.838359","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381631","","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Clouds;Information retrieval;Instruments;Land surface;MODIS;Production;Satellites;Snow;Statistics","albedo;data acquisition;ecology;radiative transfer;radiometry;spectral analysis;terrain mapping;vegetation mapping","0.3 to 5.0 micron;0.47 to 2.1 micron;MOD43B3 albedo products;MODIS MOD12Q1 IGBP land cover classification product;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;NASA Aqua satellite;NASA Terra satellite;Terra MODIS land products;black-sky albedo;cloud cover;diffuse bihemispherical albedo;direct-beam directional hemispherical albedo;ecosystem-dependent phenological behavior;ecosystem-dependent temporal interpolation;geolocation;global spectral surface albedo;land surface anisotropy;land surface radiative characteristics;missing data;radiative transfer;remote sensing;retrieved pixel temporal data;snow cover;vegetation phenology;white-sky albedo","","122","","51","","","Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Their goal is to interactively learn the semantic queries that users have in mind. Interaction is used to fill the gap between the semantic meaning and the low-level image representations. The purpose of this article is to analyze how to merge all the semantic information that users provided to the system during past retrieval sessions. We propose an approach to exploit the knowledge provided by user interaction based on binary annotations (relevant or irrelevant images). Such semantic annotations may be integrated in the similarity matrix of the database images. This similarity matrix is analyzed in the kernel matrix framework. In this context, a kernel adaptation method is proposed, but taking care of preserving the properties of kernels. Using this approach, a semantic kernel is incrementally learnt. To deal with practical constraint implementations, an eigendecomposition of the whole matrix is considered, and a efficient scheme is proposed to compute a low-rank approximated kernel matrix. It allows a strict control of the required memory space and of the algorithm complexity, which is linear to the database size. Experiments have been carried out on a large generalist database in order to validate the approach.","","POD:0-7695-2217-3","10.1109/MMSE.2004.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1376705","","Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image databases;Image representation;Image retrieval;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Kernel;Knowledge management;Size control","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;relevance feedback;visual databases","algorithm complexity;binary annotation;content-based image retrieval;kernel matrix framework;low-level image representation;relevance feedback method;semantic information;semantic queries","","2","","20","","","13-15 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simulated data are generated implementing classical superficial scattering models: IEM model for active L-band and L-C-band passive data, GO model for X-band passive data. Data are simulated considering different roughness conditions and moisture content. As the inversion problem is very complex, artificial feedforward backpropagation neural networks (NN) were employed. The best performing NNs are chosen to simulate a retrieval with a dataset artificially added with noise. In each case, the best retrieved parameter is the real part of the dielectric constant, while roughness parameters, especially autocorrelation length, is not very well retrieved. In many cases, retrieved values are out of range, so that the simulated values and targets appear unrelated. Applying a very generic filter that eliminates values very far from the proper range, correlation coefficients grow up. This filter cleans up the resulting data removing a small part of them. After this filtration, correlation coefficients relative to the real part of the dielectric constant surpass 0.82. In spite of the filtering process, roughness parameters retrieval is of inferior quality. On smooth soil, the three considered configurations work in an equivalent way, excellently retrieving the real part of the dielectric constant, without a need for filtration. On medium and rough soil, inversion results generally more difficult, so that performance gets worse. Active-passive approach results more efficient than the L-C-X one","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1370150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1370150","","Backpropagation;Dielectric constant;Filters;Filtration;Information retrieval;L-band;Neural networks;Scattering;Soil moisture;Testing","backpropagation;feedforward neural nets;hydrological techniques;information retrieval;moisture;oceanographic techniques;passive radar;permittivity;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;soil;spaceborne radar;topography (Earth)","C bands passive data;HYDRO-POL;IEM model;L band active data;L band passive data;X-band passive data;artificial feedforward backpropagation neural networks;autocorrelation length;bare soils;classical superficial scattering models;correlation coefficient;dielectric constant;filtering process;moisture content;rough soil inversion;roughness parameters retrieval;smooth soil;soil moisture retrieval","","2","","12","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose the application of independent component analysis, which seems to have clear advantages over two classic methods: latent semantic analysis and self-organizing maps. Latent semantic analysis is a simple method for automatic generation of concepts that are useful, e.g., in encoding documents for information retrieval purposes. However, these concepts cannot easily be interpreted by humans. Self-organizing maps can be used to generate an explicit diagram which characterizes the relationships between words. The resulting map reflects syntactic categories in the overall organization and semantic categories in the local level. The self-organizing map does not, however, provide any explicit distinct categories for the words. Independent component analysis applied on word context data gives distinct features which reflect syntactic and semantic categories. Thus, independent component analysis gives features or categories that are both explicit and can easily be interpreted by humans. This result can be obtained without any human supervision or tagged corpora that would have some predetermined morphological, syntactic or semantic information.","1098-7576;10987576","POD:0-7803-8359-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2004.1379914","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1379914","","Feature extraction;Frequency;Humans;Independent component analysis;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Matrix decomposition;Neural networks;Self organizing feature maps","feature extraction;independent component analysis;linguistics;self-organising feature maps","independent component analysis;latent semantic analysis;linguistic feature extraction;self-organizing maps","","6","","22","","","25-29 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the overestimation of snow depth in West China (especially the Tibet Plateau regions), the global retrieval algorithm of snow depth from SSM/I data is modified by ground observations in West China region. Both of the global and modified algorithms adopt the negative gradient of brightness temperature at 19 and 37GHz frequencies at horizontal polarization that were generated the snow layer's scattering feature. However, other surface features such as the precipitation, cold desert, frozen ground, may have similar scattering signature to snow cover. Grody's decision tree, containing various filters, is used to separate the scattering signature of snow cover from other scattering signature. For the snow cover pixels after the filters technique, we retrieved the snow depth by global and modified algorithms in East and West China, respectively. The retrieval results have been assessed by the MODIS snow products (MODISC1 snow products) with two methods of accuracy assessment, i.e. the overall accuracy and Kappa analysis based on the error matrix. The two snow-products agree very well based on the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients.

Because the CMOD4 model was originally developed for the C-band, W-polarized scatterometer data, polarization ratio should be applied to process RADARSAT ScanSAR data. In order to get an estimate of a suitable polarization ratio, wind directions from the collocated QuikSCAT data in the China Seas were taken as input to CMOD4 model for wind speeds retrieval from RADARSAT ScanSAR data, the results of the comparison of wind speeds from QuikSCAT versus the RADARSAT ScanSAR derived wind speeds indicate that Kirchhoff polarization ratio is suitable for wind speeds retrieval using horizontal polarization RADARSAT ScanSAR data.

The algorithm is implemented in three stages. First, the infrared radiance perturbations due to clouds are estimated and corrected by combined processing of the infrared and microwave data. Second, a Projected Principal Components (PPC) transform is used to reduce the dimensionality of and optimally extract geophysical profile information from the cloud-cleared infrared radiance data. Third, an artificial feedforward neural network (NN) is used to estimate the desired geophysical parameters from the projected principal components. The cloud-clearing of the infrared radiances was performed by the AIRS Science Team using infrared brightness temperature contrasts in adjacent fields of view and microwave-derived estimates of the infrared clear-column radiances to estimate and correct the radiance contamination introduced by clouds. The PPC compression technique was used to reduce the infrared radiance dimensionality by a factor of ~100, while retaining over 99.99 percent of the radiance variance that is correlated to the geophysical profiles. This compression allows the use of smaller, faster, and more robust estimators. A single-layer feedforward neural network with approximately 3000 degrees of freedom was then used to estimate the geophysical profiles in 1-km layers from the surface to 20 km. The performance of this method (henceforth referred to as the PPC/NN method) was evaluated using global EOS-Aqua orbits colocated with European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) fields for two days in 2003: September 3 and October 12. Over 15,000 footprints over ocean were used in the study. Retrieval performance compares favorably with that obtained with simulated observations from the NOAA88b radiosonde - set of approximately 7500 profiles.
