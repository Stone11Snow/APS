Currently the system solves factoid based questions as where, what, why, which etc using english as source language but later can be extended to other languages once their enconvertors and deconvertors are available.

In this paper, we discuss different types of social networking services and user's information shared on these services. We categorize the content based information into two categories namely textual content based information and visual content based information.

Thus, the queries are enriched by semantic knowledge, which enhances search performance. In this context, this paper describes a text mining-based approach for Arabic semantic IR, which considers senses of query terms. Experiments and results based on a standard Arabic Test collection are discussed through this communication. In the one hand, we compare dictionary versus corpus-based approaches for modeling semantics. On the other hand, we compare some Arabic NLP tools in the preprocessing step.

Rapid growth of data demands more efficient processing and information retrieval approaches, among those Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Word2Vec are commonly used. LDA explains a global relationship by investigating latent topics from a collection of documents and assigning each document with a probability distribution over all topics. In contrary, Word2Vec projects words to vectors with semantic meanings by local contexts. However, LDA concentrates on handling high probability words and neglects low probability but meaningful ones. While Word2Vec explores only surroundings of the target words within sentences, which makes global improvement of word representations very difficult. Therefore, we propose an improved text information retrieval method that integrates both global and local text information.

In the proposed schemes, instead of binary decision diagrams utilized in the original CPIR, we employ an octal tree based approach, in which non-sink nodes have eight child nodes. Using octal trees offers two advantages: i) a serial implementation of the proposed scheme in software is faster than the original scheme and ii) its bandwidth usage becomes less than the original scheme when the number of items in the data set is moderately high (e.g., 4,096 for 80-bit security level using Damgard-Jurik cryptosystem). In addition, we present a highly-optimized parallel algorithm for shared-memory multi-core/processor architectures, which minimizes the number of synchronization points between the cores. We show that the parallel implementation is about 50 times faster than the serial implementation for a data set with 4,096 items on an eight-core machine. Finally, we propose a hybrid algorithm that scales the CPIR scheme to larger data sets with small overhead in bandwidth complexity. We demonstrate that the hybrid scheme based on octal trees can lead to more than two orders of magnitude faster parallel implementations than serial implementations based on binary trees. Comparison with the original as well as the other schemes in the literature reveals that our scheme is the best in terms of bandwidth requirement.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2015.2456021","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155582","Number Theoretic Private Information Retrieval;Number theoretic private information retrieval;Parallel Algorithms;Privacy;Security;parallel algorithms;privacy;security","Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Databases;Encryption;Protocols;Servers","binary decision diagrams;data privacy;information retrieval;parallel algorithms","Lipmaa CPIR scheme;bandwidth complexity;bandwidth requirement;binary decision diagrams;computationally-private information retrieval scheme;eight-core machine;highly-optimized parallel algorithm;log-squared communication complexity;number theoretic private information retrieval;octal tree based approach;synchronization points","","1","","30","","20150713","June 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a novel framework for implementing Intelligent Information Retrieval Technique in a Tsunami Detection System using Wireless Sensor Networks. This system generates intelligent data and spreads a warning message about the occurrence of tsunami. The proposed method uses SentiWordNet, a lexical resource explicitly used for opinion mining. This framework extracts intelligent information from the messages which are transmitted by first filtering the redundant text from them followed by stemming and stop words removal and then gathers all the opinion words and calculates their sentiment values using SentiWordNet. Thereafter polarity of the text is calculated and a warning message is conveyed.

Although some well-known algorithms exist already, results show there is still more work to be done in many aspects. This paper proposes method integrating Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) with Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC). The approach behind combining these two methods is to counter the synonymy and polysemy that occurs when previous SRC methods use bag-of-words model. Moreover, we observe that clusters by previous SRC methods are not satisfied and can be further clustered. Thus, we give room for other hidden topics to be shown.

Experimental results show that our system achieves better performance by comparing with state-of-the-art MIR systems.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4229-2; POD:978-1-5090-5254-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7559613","Learning to rank;Mathematical Information Retrieval;RankBoost","Feature extraction;Indexes;Mathematical model;Measurement;Search engines;Training","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing","MIR systems;RankBoost;mathematical information retrieval system;query formula;supervised ranking approach","","","","","","","19-23 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Results suggest that linking resources in a semantic manner enhance searching capabilities over the web such that using keywords as linking information can be used to calculate the semantic similarity. Consequently, the traditional retrieval system often suffers from scalability and inefficiency problems when processing or analyzing such large-scale data. Hence, the basic idea is to propose a framework that retrieves the information effectively from the Resource Description Framework (RDF) using SPARQL ENGINE. Furthermore, we purpose pruning method that improves accuracy by quickly filtering out the false alarms (whenever there is a change in the source) and automatically update the RDF document that can be further used for semantically retrieving the root source content of the particular resource.

The probabilistic model captures the IR problem using a probabilistic framework, It tries to find the probability that a document will be relevant to a user query or not. In this we have a collection of user query, and there is an ideal answer set for each query, first of all initial set of documents are retrieved from the corpus or collection of documents. User inspects these documents for searching the relevant documents, then IR system use this information to find the description to get the ideal answer set. This work is carried out to analyze and evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of various probabilistic models with use of new data set i.e., FIRE 2011.

One way to design a PDP, is to compute a function depending on a secret and the file. Then, during the verification stage, the client reveals the secret input to the server who recomputes the function and sends the output back to the client. The client can then compare both values to determine if the server is still in possession of the file. The problem with this approach is that once the server knows the secret, it is not useful anymore. In this article, we present two PDP schemes inspired in Multiple-Server Private Information Retrieval (MSPIR) protocols. In a traditional MSPIR protocol, the goal is to retrieve a given block of the file from a group of servers storing identical copies of it, without telling the servers what block was retrieved. In contrast, our goal is to let servers evaluate a function using an input that is not revealed to them. We show that our constructions are secure, practical and that they can complement existing approaches in storage architectures using multiple cloud providers.

Because Image recognition technology has reached near-perfection when it comes to scanning English and other language text. But optical character recognition (OCR) software capable of digitizing printed Tamil text with high levels of accuracy is still elusive. Only a few people are familiar with the ancient characters and make attempts to convert them into written documents manually. If this continues, all the precious information given by our forefathers will not be known to the future generations. The proposed system overcomes such a situation by converting all the ancient characters from inscriptions and palm manuscripts into Tamil digital text format. After converting into the Tamil digital text, the words will not be correct spelling. Because the ancient words are Etymological word, the meaning is not known.

In this paper we propose a new method to evaluate the performance of security protocols in cloud computing. Instead of computation cost and communication cost, we will analyze the economic costs of security protocols in cloud computing. Private information retrieval(PIR) is a privacy enhancing protocol designed to hide access patterns during data retrieval, which makes it useful to protect user's privacy in cloud environment. While plenty PIR schemes were proposed since this concept was firstly raised in 1995, real economic costs of PIR schemes in cloud environment remain unexplored. In this paper We will revisit typical multi-server PIR schemes in cloud environment under a realistic indicator - economic costs.

One interesting solution is to integrate fuzzy ontologies in order to achieve semantic interoperability and offer a way to handle vague and imprecise information regarding the medical field. In this paper, our aim is to perform an effective IR by extending its understanding of ambiguous medical concepts. We propose a fuzzy ontology-based medical IR approach which is composed of three components: (1) personalized medical ontology building, (2) contextualized fuzzification of the personalized medical ontology and (3) a query reformulation process based on the resulting fuzzy ontology. A prototype has been implemented allowing experimental evaluation of the proposal.

It is then up to the information retrieval systems (IRS) to obtain a precise representation of the user's information need and the context (preferences) of the information. To address this problem, we investigate optimization of IRS to individual information needs in order of relevance. The goal of this article is to develop algorithms that optimize the ranking of documents retrieved from IRS according to user search context. In particular, the ranking task that led the user to engage in information-seeking behaviour during search tasks. This article discusses and describes a Document Ranking Optimization (DROPT) algorithm for IR in an Internet-based or designated databases environment. Conversely, as the volume of information available online and in designated databases is growing continuously, ranking algorithms can play a major role in the context of search results. In this article, a DROPT technique for documents retrieved from a corpus is developed with respect to document index keywords and the query vectors. This is based on calculating the weight (w<sub>ij</sub>) of keywords in the document index vector, calculated as a function of the frequency of a keyword k<sub>j</sub> across a document. The purpose of the DROPT technique is to reflect how human users can judge the context changes in IR result rankings according to information relevance. This article shows that it is possible for the DROPT technique to overcome some of the limitations of existing traditional (tf × idf) algorithms via adaptation. The empirical evaluation using metrics measures on the DROPT technique carried out through human user interaction shows improvement over the traditional relevance feedback technique to demonstrate improving IR effectiveness.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0996-1; POD:978-1-5090-0997-8","10.1109/IEMCON.2016.7746242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7746242","DROPT technique;Internet ranking;information relevance;information retrieval;relevance feedback;tƒ × idƒ","Algorithm design and analysis;Context;Indexes;Internet;Optimization;Search engines","Internet;database management systems;information retrieval systems;optimisation;query formulation;user interfaces;vectors","DROPT;IRS;Internet-based databases environment;ad-hoc keywords;designated databases environment;document index vector;document ranking optimization;document retrieval;human user interaction;information retrieval systems;information-seeking behaviour;query vectors;relevance feedback;search queries;search tasks","","","","","","","13-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Learning is a process by adjusting the weight with respect to input features so that the actual output response will matches to the desired output. The role of learning based network is that the point distributes themselves across the input space to selected or mapped group of similar input vectors, while the output nodes compete among themselves. Once network trained, the network produces a low dimensional data clustering of the input value that preserves the ordering of the actual structure. Thus nodes can be recognizing groups of similar input vectors. It generates a mapping of the input vector to the output layer, which depends on input vectors and overall result in dimensionality reduction of the input space. Follows the “winner-take-all” policy means which cluster unit weight matches more closely with the input pattern is considered the winning neurons so that pattern classification process take place.

Developers can often fix similar bugs with a shorter time and a higher quality since they can focus on fewer code files. Therefore, similar bug recommendation is a meaningful task which can improve development efficiency. Rocha et al. propose the first similar bug recommendation system named NextBug. Although NextBug performs better than a start-of-the-art duplicated bug detection technique REP, its performance is not optimal and thus more work is needed to improve its effectiveness. Technically, it is also rather simple as it relies only upon a standard information retrieval technique, i.e., cosine similarity. In the paper, we propose a novel approach to recommend similar bugs. The approach combines a traditional information retrieval technique and a word embedding technique, and takes bug titles and descriptions as well as bug product and component information into consideration. To evaluate the approach, we use datasets from two popular open-source projects, i.e., Eclipse and Mozilla, each of which contains bug reports whose bug ids range from [1,400000]. The results show that our approach improves the performance of NextBug statistically significantly and substantially for both projects.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9002-6; POD:978-1-4673-9003-3","10.1109/ISSRE.2016.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7774514","Information Retrieval;Recommendation Systems;Similar Bugs;Word Embedding","Computer bugs;Context;Context modeling;Data mining;Information retrieval;Software engineering;Standards","information retrieval;program debugging;recommender systems","NextBug;REP;bug product;bug titles;common code files;component information;duplicated bug detection technique;information retrieval technique;open-source projects;similar bug recommendation system;similar bug reports;word embedding technique","","","","","","","23-27 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To enhance biomedical retrieval, we propose a novel framework based on learning to rank. Learning to rank is a series of state-of-the-art information retrieval techniques, and has been proved effective in many information retrieval tasks. In the proposed framework, we attempt to tackle the problem of the abundance of terminologies by constructing ranking models, which focus on not only retrieving the most relevant documents, but also diversifying the searching results to increase the completeness of the resulting list for a given query. In the model training, we propose two novel document labeling strategies, and combine several traditional retrieval models as learning features.

In this paper a technique is proposed which improves results. In this technique web pages are stored in xml database. WordNet is used as dictionary for finding synonyms of user's query. The technique is based on context of word. Using context of words helps improvise the search results. The technique is called ontological indexing. This technique is compared with text based search. The words on the web pages are mapped to concepts in ontology. Mapping score is generated for each word. Results of search depend on value of mapping score.

An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a formal statements of information needs, known as query, into the system and ends when results are given. Results consist of several objects that match the query with different degrees of relevancy. The relevancy of the results is still an important concern and is often associated with the volume of the results: getting better relevancy involves bigger volume of returned information while lesser volume involves lower relevancy. This issue makes the Web IR an active domain of research and development. Since a decade, an interest was given to software agents technology and its applications. Agents have been successfully used in many fields: agents-based market systems prove to be efficient for implementing e-commerce or B2B applications on the Internet, thanks to inherent properties such as prominency of interactions, collaboration between agents, autonomy, scalability, flexibility, interoperability, etc. Although the use of agents in other application domains is not yet widespread, the integration of agents into market mechanisms bring clear and efficient solutions to Quality of Service (QoS) issues encountered in most distributed applications and notably in Web IR systems. Mobility allows defining a new interaction model, where agents act on behalf of final users or devices providing resources, while Market Places provide an organizational setting for the matching of demands and offers. This paper, a renewed form of [1], will show how market mechanisms and mobility can ease collaboration between agents to deliver a service with relevant results in Web IR.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2300-4; POD:978-1-5090-2301-1","10.1109/CTS.2016.0088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7871026","Agents;Information Retrieval;Market Place;Negotiation","Indexes;Mobile agents;Quality of service;Search engines;Security;Servers","electronic commerce;groupware;information resources;marketing;multi-agent systems;quality of service;query processing;software agents","B2B applications;QoS issues;Web IR systems;World Wide Web;agents-based market systems;e-commerce applications;information retrieval;market collaborative agents;organizational setting;quality of service issues;query matching;research and development;result relevancy;software agents technology","","","","","","","Oct. 31 2016-Nov. 4 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It follows that the systems participating in evaluation campaigns are ranked by biased estimators of effectiveness. In this paper, we address the problem of query sample selection bias in machine learning terms and study experimentally how retrieval system rankings are affected by it. To this end, we apply a number of retrieval effectiveness measures and query probability estimation methods useful to correct sample selection bias. We report that the ranking of the most effective systems and that of the least effective systems is fairly affected by query sample selection bias, while the ranking of the average systems is much more affected.

Popular search Engine like Google Bing at core have this methodology in operation. Keywords are terms Extracted from document or single sentence generating sense when clustered in context. Same Keywords might be present in different document but structure and position of keywords build different meaning, this highlights keyword importance. Keywords are daily used atomic terms which when used in two or more group to represent information form phrases or short sentences and require concept generated by keywords. Success of keyword technology is simple match of documents consisting Question Keyword. Even though irrelevant results are retrieved due to word sense Ambiguity (WSD) necessitate concept extraction, web information is multiplying in petabytes and daily 20 petabytes of information is processed by Google still core technique of search remains on keyword as best even today. A lot effort has been taken to extend this keyword search patterns to relational database systems from last four decades. A large volume of information is stored in data which is as large as size of static web. Extending keyword search to relational data base systems would eliminate requirement of specialized data processing and manipulation language like sql. Database would be handled by nontechnical person simply with assistance of word. Relational database system are operated with precise query retrieving all matched records restricted query dimension on other hand IR System rank and present information documents containing cluster and focusing on user experience and precision. Extending keyword pattern search on relational database management system also requires extending Index, ranking, clustering to database management system with specially constructed components performing above task.

A new generation of services can arise from these complementary paradigms. One of them is crucial for a daily basis interaction with this new smart world, Information Retrieval (IR), mostly in the form of search engines can also evolve into more powerful tools. Based on that, a new architecture of this kind of services has to be defined by the synergy and challenges that WoT imposes. We propose an IR as a service IRaaS architecture for the new era of the Web of Things. It considers the high dynamics in WoT which leverages a significant amount of changes in the IR collection to merge efficiently conventional IR concepts and the cloud power. Our IRaaS approach takes into account the big-data characteristics of WoT concerning velocity, volume, volatility, and the variety of data. The architecture has two main pillars: the indexing and analysis block, and the querying and retrieval block.

These algorithms build summaries (both concise and diverse), by selecting appropriate segments from the input signal, also making them good candidates to summarize music. We evaluate the summarization process on binary and multiclass music genre classification tasks, by comparing the accuracy when using summarized datasets against the accuracy when using human-oriented summaries, continuous segments (the traditional method used for addressing the previously mentioned time constraints), and full songs of the original dataset. We show that GRASSHOPPER, LexRank, LSA, MMR, and a Support Sets-based centrality model improve classification performance when compared to selected baselines.

It consists in combining both music-context and user-context to rank search results. The core contribution of this work is the investigation of different types of contexts derived from social networks. We distinguish semantic and social information and use them to build semantic and social profiles for music and users. The different contexts and profiles can be combined and personalized by the user. We have assessed the quality of our model using a real dataset from Last.fm. The results show that the use of user-context to rank search results is two times better than the use of music-context.

Although these models have already achieved good performance, it has been shown that most of dissatisfaction cases in relevance are due to term mismatch between queries and documents. In this paper, we introduce novel method to compute term frequency based on semantic similarities using distributed representations of words in a vector space (Word Embeddings).

The objective of research work in this paper is to explore clustering approaches which can be useful in automatically mining the content from Carnatic instrumental music. The content to be retrieved is the instrument that is primarily used to play the song. Carnatic music songs with ten different instruments namely, Flute, Harmonium, Mandolin, Nagaswara, Santoor, Saxophone, Sitar, Shehnai, Veena and Violin are considered as input. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Linear Predictive Coefficients (LPC) features are used for representing music information. In the first step, visualization technique is used to explore the capability of different features in distinguishing Carnatic music with different instruments. Then different clustering techniques are used for understanding natural way of grouping among this instrumental music. A discussion on the comparison of instrument clustering results with different algorithms, combined with various features is also presented.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8286-1; POD:978-1-4673-8287-8","10.1109/IACC.2016.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7544822","Clustering;Instrument Detection;Music Information Retrieval","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Instruments;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Music","cepstral analysis;content-based retrieval;data mining;feature extraction;music;musical instruments;pattern clustering","Carnatic instrumental music;Carnatic music songs;LPC features;MFCC;MIR;Mel frequency cepstral coefficients;automatic content mining;content based information retrieval;instrumental music clustering;linear predictive coefficients;music collection;music information representation;music information retrieval;visualization technique","","","","","","","27-28 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In marine areas it is very important to know the state of the sea conditions to direct gateways to be opened from the neighboring areas to allow water activities. Messages are sent from nearby sea areas stating the sea conditions. This paper proposes a novel framework for deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks in marine environment to carry out information retrieval and generate intelligent data. This method uses SentiWordNet, a lexical resource which is used for opinion mining. This framework extracts intelligent information from the aggregate message by first filtering the message and transforming it by lemmatization and then gathering the opinion words and calculating their scores with the help of SentiWordNet. Thereby polarity of the sentence is calculated and the message is conveyed. The proposed method is executed on the messages sent from various marine areas and the results prove the efficiency and accuracy of the method.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8251-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-8252-3; POD:978-1-4799-8253-0","10.1109/ICCSCE.2015.7482214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482214","Information Retrieval;Intelligent Information;Marine Environment;Wireless Sensor Networks","Cloud computing;Information retrieval;Logic gates;Monitoring;Storms;Wind;Wireless sensor networks","information retrieval;marine engineering;text analysis;wireless sensor networks","SentiWordNet;intelligent data;intelligent information retrieval;lexical resource;marine areas;marine environment;opinion words;water activities;wireless sensor networks","","","","9","","","27-29 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence it is imperative that the information systems support the storage and management of multi-lingual data effectively. The primary requirement to achieve this goal is that the principal data repositories should support storage and retrieval of Multi-lingual data.

"Semantically Enhanced Medical Information Retrieval System: A Tensor Factorization Based Approach","H. Wang; Q. Zhang; J. Yuan","","IEEE Access","","2017","PP","99","1","1","Medical information retrieval plays an increasingly important role to help physicians and domain experts to better access medical related knowledge and information, and support decision making. Integrating the medical knowledge bases has the potential to improve the information retrieval performance through incorporating medical domain knowledge for relevance assessment. However, this is not a trivial task because of the challenges to effectively utilize the domain knowledge in the medical knowledge bases. In this paper, we proposed a novel medical information retrieval system with a two-stage query expansion strategy, which is able to effectively model and incorporate the latent semantic associations to improve the performance. This system consists of two parts. First, we applied a heuristic approach to enhance the widely used pseudo relevance feedback method for more effective query expansion, through iteratively expanding the queries to boost the similarity score between queries and documents. Second, to improve the retrieval performance with structured knowledge bases, we presented a latent semantic relevance model based on tensor factorization to identify semantic association patterns under sparse settings. These identified patterns are then used as inference paths to trigger knowledge-based query expansion in medical information retrieval. Experiments with the TREC CDS 2014 dataset (a) showed that the performance of the proposed system is significantly better than the baseline system and the systems reported in TREC CDS 2014 conference, and is comparable with state-of-the-art systems; (b) demonstrated the capability of tensor-based semantic enrichment methods for medical information retrieval tasks.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2698142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7912400","Information retrieval;knowledge based systems;tensor factorization","Data mining;Information retrieval;Knowledge based systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Semantics;Tensile stress;Unified modeling language","","","","","","","","20170426","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Such natural language texts illustrate the change requirement involving various domain related concepts. Software developers need to find appropriate search terms from those concepts so that they could locate the possible locations in the source code using a search technique. Once such locations are identified, they can implement the requested changes there. Studies suggest that developers often perform poorly in coming up with good search terms for a change task. In this paper, we propose a novel technique-STRICT-that automatically identifies suitable search terms for a software change task by analyzing its task description using two information retrieval (IR) techniques-TextRank and POSRank. These IR techniques determine a term's importance based on not only its co-occurrences with other important terms but also its syntactic relationships with them. Experiments using 1,939 change requests from eight subject systems report that STRICT can identify better quality search terms than baseline terms from 52%-62% of the requests with 30%-57% Top-10 retrieval accuracy which are promising.

Although crash reports contain valuable information for debugging, there are often too many for developers to examine individually. Therefore, in industry, crash reports are often automatically grouped together in buckets. Ubuntu's repository contains crashes from hundreds of software systems available with Ubuntu. A variety of crash report bucketing methods are evaluated using data collected by Ubuntu's Apport automated crash reporting system. The trade-off between precision and recall of numerous scalable crash deduplication techniques is explored. A set of criteria that a crash deduplication method must meet is presented and several methods that meet these criteria are evaluated on a new dataset. The evaluations presented in this paper show that using off-the-shelf information retrieval techniques, that were not designed to be used with crash reports, outperform other techniques which are specifically designed for the task of crash bucketing at realistic industrial scales. This research indicates that automated crash bucketing still has a lot of room for improvement, especially in terms of identifier tokenization.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4186-8; POD:978-1-5090-2242-7","10.1109/MSR.2016.035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7832906","Automatic Crash Re- porting;Call Stack Trace;Contextual Information;Deduplication;Duplicate Bug Reports;Duplicate Crash Report;Free/Open Source Software;Information Retrieval;Software En- gineering","Computer bugs;Debugging;Indexing;Information retrieval;Organizations;Software","information retrieval;program debugging;software maintenance","Ubuntu Apport automated crash reporting system;Ubuntu repository;crash report bucketing methods;identifier tokenization;off-the-shelf information retrieval techniques;precision factor;recall factor;scalable crash report deduplication technique;software systems","","","","","","","14-15 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper the semantic based information retrieval methodology is proposed to get data from the web archives in a specific domain by gathering the domain relevant information with web crawler. By utilizing ontology and semantic information matched with a given user's query is used for retrieval. The results are discussed for retrieving attractive tourist places in a particular city.

We demonstrate the ability of the proposed method, abbreviated as EO-BoW, to improve the retrieval performance by providing extensive experiments on two multi-class image datasets. The BoW model can be applied to other domains as well, so we also evaluate our approach using a collection of 45 time-series datasets, a text dataset, and a video dataset. The gains are three-fold since the EO-BoW can improve the mean Average Precision, while reducing the encoding time and the database storage requirements. Finally, we provide evidence that the EO-BoW maintains its representation ability even when used to retrieve objects from classes that were not seen during the training.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2016.2545657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439840","Dictionary Learning;Entropy Optimization;Image Retrieval;Information Search and Retrieval;Information search and retrieval;Time-series Retrieval;dictionary learning;entropy optimization;image retrieval;time-series retrieval","Dictionaries;Entropy;Feature extraction;Histograms;Optimization;Time series analysis;Training","image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern clustering","cluster hypothesis;database storage requirements;entropy optimized feature-based bag-of-words representation;entropy-based optimization criterion;information retrieval;mean average precision;multiclass image datasets;supervised dictionary learning method","","2","","45","","20160323","July 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose to extract scale-invariant image features and then perform clustering to reduce the number of features needed for image matching. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are investigated as candidate clustering approaches. The image matching complexity at the database server is quadratic in the (small) number of clusters, not in the (very large) number of image features. We employ an image-dependent information content metric to approximate the model order, i.e., the number of clusters, needed for accurate matching, which is preferable to setting the model order using trial and error. We show how to combine the hypotheses provided by PCA and NMF factor loadings, thereby obtaining more accurate retrieval than using either approach alone. In experiments on a database of urban images, we obtain a top-1 retrieval accuracy of 89% and a top-3 accuracy of 92.5%.","","","10.1109/ICMEW.2016.7574695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7574695","Clustering;information retrieval;non-negative matrix factorization;principal component analysis","Databases;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Loading;Mobile handsets;Principal component analysis;Servers","feature extraction;image matching;information retrieval;matrix decomposition;principal component analysis","NMF;PCA;bandwidth-constrained information retrieval;image acquisition process;image matching complexity;image-dependent information content metric;mobile device;non-negative matrix factorization;principal component analysis;remote server;retrieval protocol;scale-invariant image features;urban images","","","","","","","11-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The DSS uses an (n, k) Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code to store the data reliably on unreliable storage nodes. Some of these nodes can be spies which report to a third party, such as an oppressive regime, which data is being requested by the user. An information theoretic PIR scheme ensures that a user can satisfy its request while revealing, to the spy nodes, no information on which data is being requested. A user can achieve PIR by downloading all the data in the DSS. However, this is not a feasible solution due to its high communication cost. We construct PIR schemes with low download communication cost. When there is b = 1 spy node in the DSS, we construct PIR schemes with download cost 1/1-R per unit of requested data (R = k/n is the code rate), achieving the information theoretic limit for linear schemes. The proposed schemes are universal since they depend on the code rate, but not on the generator matrix of the code.

This makes the task of navigating through this enormous amount of data quite difficult for the user. As users struggle to navigate through this wealth of information, the need for the development of an automated system that can extract the required information becomes urgent. This paper presents a Question Answering system to ease the process of information retrieval. Question Answering systems have been around for quite some time and are a sub-field of information retrieval and natural language processing. The task of any Question Answering system is to seek an answer to a free form factual question. The difficulty of pinpointing and verifying the precise answer makes question answering more challenging than simple information retrieval done by search engines. The research objective of this paper is to develop a novel approach to Question Answering based on a composition of conventional approaches of Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language processing (NLP). The focus is also on exploring the use of a structured and annotated knowledge base as opposed to an unstructured knowledge base. The knowledge base used here is DBpedia and the final system is evaluated on the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 2004 questions dataset.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4284-5; POD:978-1-5090-4285-2","10.1109/ICSC.2017.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889571","Information Retrieval;Natural Language Processing;Question Answering System;Structured Semantic Data","Databases;Information retrieval;Internet;Knowledge discovery;Natural language processing;Semantics","Internet;Web sites;knowledge based systems;natural language processing;question answering (information retrieval)","DBpedia;IR;NLP;World Wide Web;annotated knowledge base;information extraction;information retrieval;natural language processing;question answering system;structured knowledge base","","","","","","","Jan. 30 2017-Feb. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
