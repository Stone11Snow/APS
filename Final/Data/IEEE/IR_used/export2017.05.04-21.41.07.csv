However, in scalable streaming of layer encoded content, sequential playback of content does not necessarily coincide with the sequential scan of a file. This property introduces another dimension of complexity in the scheduling of data block retrieval. In this work, we develop a novel file organization strategy, harmonic interleaving, which can effectively handle the dynamically changing playback rate of multimedia data retrieval. The proposed scheme not only eliminates the retrieval of unnecessary blocks but also minimizes disk head movement.

Center, Moffett Field, CA","2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference","20060724","2006","","","9 pp.","","The scope of integrated system health management (ISHM) is the end-to-end autonomous management of subsystems, systems and systems of systems. Among ISHM's components is management of data, information, and knowledge to detect and diagnose anomalies, and propose mitigation procedures for crew implementation. Complex systems such as the International Space Station (ISS) generate a large amount of data, over 160,000 documents that are distributed across disparate systems. But this data is fragmented and applications are unable to interoperate. In addition, the lack of a seamless mechanism for ensuring use of latest, best information hinders development of much needed modeling, simulation and visualization systems that could increase the operating safety of a complex system. To reduce development time for ISHM systems, builders of advanced diagnostic systems require rapid retrieval of precise information from various sources spread across multiple, distributed, heterogeneous databases. To meet this challenge, a technological leap that goes beyond the bounds of today's understanding of documents is needed. Software developed by NASA Ames researchers in the Advanced Knowledge Exploration Networks (AKEN) Lab that enables diagnostic systems and distributed information sources to be linked into an information grid is one such technology. Funded through the Integrated Testbed Prototypes (ITP) Project, in 2005 AKEN installed Netmark's context based retrieval system at Johnson Space Center to incorporate this technology into advanced diagnostic systems. For the ITP Project this technology was given the name Knowledge Mining Application (KMA).

Linguists make a very conservative estimate that 4000 languages are spoken today in the world, and in many of these languages, very limited linguistic knowledge and speech data/resources are available. Rapid transition to a new target language becomes a practical concern within the concept of tiered resources. In this study, we present our research efforts towards multilingual spoken information retrieval with limitations in acoustic training data. We propose different retrieval algorithms to leverage existing resources from resource-rich languages as well as the target language using a lattice-based search.

We implemented this framework on our drum-sound detection system. We first obtained onset sequences of the drum sounds with our system and extracted drum patterns. On the basis of our observation that the same drum patterns tend to be repeated, we detected time points which deviate from the periodicity as error candidates. Finally, we verified each error candidate to judge whether it is an actual onset or not.

Soil moisture data with a spatial resolution of 800 m acquired during the SGP97 campaign, were used as truth data in the training and the validation processes. In addition to backscatter values retrieved from RADARSAT-1 image, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land cover and soil texture have been added as an input to neural network algorithm. The effects of sub-pixels variability of the NDVI and land cover type on the retrieval of soil moisture have been investigated by comparing the measured and the predicted soil moisture. Further, all training and validation pixels (800 m resolution) have been labeled as either homogeneous or heterogeneous based on the occurrence of the same land cover type. The results showed that, homogeneous pixels are more likely to have better accuracy than heterogeneous pixels in soil moisture classification.

As described in this paper, hiflyViews represents a leap forward in satellite telemetry visualization as follows: flexible data access: data can be accessed in live or retrieval; archived data can be fetched starting from a given time or a set of telemetry parameters having certain values, validities or change rate (slope or first derivative); data can be pushed from the server or pulled from the client; data can be sent always or whenever there is a change. Flexible data presentation: data presentation is performed via the concept of layout (alphanumeric, graphical and synoptic layouts are initially available); layouts can be arranged as desired within a telemetry display; displays can be embedded within other displays; rich text (with varying sizes, fonts, formats ...) is supported throughout. Openness: display definitions are XML documents satisfying a formalized XML schema. Access to data is performed through a fully formalized CORBA ICD (interface control document); there is no need of directly accessing the spacecraft or fleet database. COTS free: open Source technology is used throughout. Full portability: runs in Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh and UNIX/Linux environments. Advanced HMI: functions such as drag and drop, scaling, zooming, panning and navigation through hyperlinks as well as unprecedented configurability are readily available.

Observation errors are found to be dominated by representativeness, due to their sensitivity to atmospheric variability on smaller scales than the NWP model gird. Their effect can be reduced by evaluating this dynamically. Profiles of temperature and total water content are retrieved from synthetic data using Newtonian iteration. An error analysis shows these are expected to improve mesoscale NWP, retrieving temperature profiles with an uncertainty of <1 K up to 5 km and humidity with <40% up to 3 km, albeit both with poor vertical resolution.

Contributions of different features at different locations are modeled using weights defined for each feature in each grid cell. These weights are iteratively updated based on user's feedback in terms of positive and negative labeling of retrieval results. Given this labeling, the weight updating scheme uses the ratios of standard deviations of the distances between relevant and irrelevant images to the standard deviations of the distances between relevant images.

Each musical pattern is converted into a sequence of music intervals by means of a fundamental frequency tracking procedure. This sequence is subsequently presented as input to a set of variable-duration HMMs. Each one of these models has been trained to recognize patterns of a corresponding predefined class. Classification is determined based on the highest recognition probability. The new type of variable-duration hidden Markov modeling proposed in this paper results in enhanced performance because 1) it deals effectively with errors that commonly originate during the feature extraction stage, and 2) it accounts for variations due to the individual expressive performance of different instrument players. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the novel classification scheme has been employed in the context of Greek traditional music, to monophonic musical patterns of a popular instrument, the Greek traditional clarinet. Although the method is also appropriate for western-style music, Greek traditional music poses extra difficulties and makes music pattern recognition a harder task.

A distinct and unique key is computed for each distinct triple. The mean and standard deviation of the set of keys computed for a symbolic image are stored along with the total number of keys as the representatives of the corresponding image. The proposed exact match retrieval scheme is based on a modified binary search technique and, thus, requires O (logn) search time in the worst case, where n is the total number of symbolic images in the SID.

The annotation process uses a multi-modal thesaurus that is built from a large collection of training images by learning associations between low-level visual features and keywords. Association rules are learned through fuzzy clustering and unsupervised feature selection. We assume that a collection of images is available and that each image is globally annotated. The objective is to extract representative visual profiles that correspond to frequent homogeneous regions, and to associate them with keywords. Our approach has three main steps. First, each image is coarsely segmented into regions, and visual features are extracted from each region. Second, the regions are categorized using a fuzzy algorithm that performs clustering and feature weighting simultaneously. As a result, we obtain clusters of regions that share subsets of relevant features. Representatives from each cluster and their relevant visual and textual features would be used to build a thesaurus. Third, fuzzy membership functions are used to label new regions based on their proximity to the thesaurus entries.

Most previous methods detected as a chorus a repeated section of a given length and had difficulty identifying both ends of a chorus section and dealing with modulations (key changes). By analyzing relationships between various repeated sections, our method, called RefraiD, can detect all the chorus sections in a song and estimate both ends of each section. It can also detect modulated chorus sections by introducing a perceptually motivated acoustic feature and a similarity that enable detection of a repeated chorus section even after modulation. Experimental results with a popular music database showed that this method correctly detected the chorus sections in 80 of 100 songs.

The challenge is on automatically extracting the perceptual features from music signal. Three rhythmic features that have influence on perceived emotional expression in music are: the tempo (fast/slow), the articulation (staccato/legato) and the motion (firm/flowing, where firm event is mainly evoked by the variation of loudness among events or by the durational variation between events). So far, only parts of the rhythmic features were extracted and used for emotion classification. As a result, either the classification result was not satisfactory or only broad classification of emotion was achieved. In this paper, we propose efficient and effective algorithms to determine these three rhythmic features based on both the findings from music psychology and psycho acoustics researches.

However, it is not easy to develop context-aware services that use context information from wearable sensor devices because of the gap between low-level sensor information and high-level context that the services require.

The conventional n-gram suffers from the insufficiency of modeling long-distance language dependencies. This paper presents a novel approach focusing on mining long distance word associations and incorporating these features into language models based on linear interpolation and maximum entropy (ME) principles. We highlight the discovery of the associations of multiple distant words from training corpus. A mining algorithm is exploited to recursively merge the frequent word subsets and efficiently construct the set of association patterns. By combining the features of association patterns into n-gram models, the association pattern n-grams are estimated with a special realization to trigger pair n-gram where only the associations of two distant words are considered. In the experiments on Chinese language modeling, we find that the incorporation of association patterns significantly reduces the perplexities of n-gram models. The incorporation using ME outperforms that using linear interpolation. Association pattern n-gram is superior to trigger pair n-gram. The perplexities are further reduced using more association steps. Further, the proposed association pattern n-grams are not only able to elevate document classification accuracies but also improve speech recognition rates","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TSA.2005.858551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1677991","Association pattern;data mining;language model;long distance association;maximum entropy and trigger pair","Biomedical optical imaging;Data mining;Entropy;Information retrieval;Interpolation;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Probability;Speech recognition;Testing","computational linguistics;data mining;interpolation;maximum entropy methods;speech recognition","Chinese language modeling;association pattern language modeling;linear interpolation;long distance word associations mining;maximum entropy principles;perplexities reduction;speech recognition;statistical n-gram language modeling;training corpus","","15","4","25","","","Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we introduce the concept of compressive wireless sensing for sensor networks in which a fusion center retrieves signal field information from an ensemble of spatially distributed sensor nodes. Energy and bandwidth are scarce resources in sensor networks and the relevant metrics of interest in our context are 1) the latency involved in information retrieval; and 2) the associated power-distortion trade-off. It is generally recognized that given sufficient prior knowledge about the sensed data (e.g., statistical characterization, homogeneity etc.), there exist schemes that have very favorable power-distortion-latency trade-offs. We propose a distributed matched source-channel communication scheme, based in part on recent results in compressive sampling theory, for estimation of sensed data at the fusion center and analyze, as a function of number of sensor nodes, the trade-offs between power, distortion and latency. Compressive wireless sensing is a universal scheme in the sense that it requires no prior knowledge about the sensed data. This universality, however, comes at the cost of optimality (in terms of a less favorable power-distortion-latency trade-off) and we quantify this cost relative to the case when sufficient prior information about the sensed data is assumed","","POD:1-59593-334-4","10.1145/1127777.1127801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662451","","Bandwidth;Character recognition;Context;Cost function;Delay;Information retrieval;Sampling methods;Sensor fusion;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","information retrieval;sensor fusion;signal sampling;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","compressive wireless sensing;distributed matched source-channel communication scheme;fusion center;information retrieval;power-distortion-latency trade-off;sampling theory;sensor network;spatially distributed sensor","","86","3","15","","","19-21 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Associative memories provide one approach to the computer-engineering problem of storing and retrieving data which is based on content rather than storage address. HNN deals with the bipolar system (i.e. -1 and +1) for direct input data, however it is useful for binary images, but unuseful for gray-level or color images unless we suppose another way for input data of such images. To overcome this obstacle, one can suppose for 8-bit gray-level image that consists of 8-layers (bitplanes) of binaries can be represented as bipolar data. In this way it is possible to express each bitplane as single binary image for HNN. The experimental results showed the usefulness of using HNN in gray-level images recognition with good results.

As a result, the feature extraction step consists of estimating the covariances between the normalized pyramid coefficients.

"Using Relevance Feedback Techniques for Optimising Media Retrieval Applications","P.

Increasing bandwidth and connectivity has led to a case where there is an arguably unmanageable amount of content stored in computers and media players. Creating the right interface for managing media is highly important in consumer electronic devices. Previous works have focused on mechanisms to classify and retrieve audio files. But mere classification is not enough in the case of personal media players, as the musical taste of each user is different, and classification cannot be purely based on what others have classified. For adoption in media players and other consumer electronic devices, the musical tastes of each user have to be taken into account while retrieving, and this aspect is missing in current systems. Also, the speed of retrieval is of prime importance in consumer electronic devices. This paper discusses ways of optimising the retrieval process, using relevance feedback from the user. The feedback is used to tune the classification process using perceptual weights. The feedback can be generated directly, or by using indirectly generated data from the behaviour of the user during the search process. Speed of retrieval can be optimised for the user, by successively optimising the search results. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach in terms of search time to get the most relevant results","0747-668X;0747668X","POD:1-4244-0216-6","10.1109/ISCE.2006.1689489","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1689489","Beat detection;Query-By-Example;Relevance feedback;content based audio retrieval","Collaboration;Consumer electronics;Feedback;Filtering;Histograms;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Music information retrieval;Portable media players;Streaming media","consumer electronics;relevance feedback","consumer electronic devices;media retrieval application;relevance feedback technique;storage capacity","","0","","13","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our formulation allows the analysis of shapes at multiple scales. Based on integral invariants, we define a notion of distance between shapes. The proposed distance measure can be computed efficiently and allows warping the shape boundaries onto each other; its computation results in optimal point correspondence as an intermediate step.

We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored.

The goal of this contest was to evaluate some state-of-the-art algorithms in the task of inducing the basic tempo (as a scalar, in beats per minute) from musical audio signals. To our knowledge, this is the first published large scale cross-validation of audio tempo induction algorithms. Participants were invited to submit algorithms to the contest organizer, in one of several allowed formats. No training data was provided. A total of 12 entries (representing the work of seven research teams) were evaluated, 11 of which are reported in this document. Results on the test set of 3199 instances were returned to the participants before they were made public. Anssi Klapuri's algorithm won the contest. This evaluation shows that tempo induction algorithms can reach over 80% accuracy for music with a constant tempo, if we do not insist on finding a specific metrical level. After the competition, the algorithms and results were analyzed in order to discover general lessons for the future development of tempo induction systems. One conclusion is that robust tempo induction entails the processing of frame features rather than that of onset lists. Further, we propose a new ""redundant"" approach to tempo induction, inspired by knowledge of human perceptual mechanisms, which combines multiple simpler methods using a voting mechanism. Machine emulation of human tempo induction is still an open issue. Many avenues for future work in audio tempo tracking are highlighted, as for instance the definition of the best rhythmic features and the most appropriate periodicity detection method.

Videos are commonly stored in compressed formats where MPEG coding techniques are adopted. In this paper, a DCT coefficient based multilingual video text detection and localization scheme for compressed videos is proposed. Candidate text blocks are detected in terms of block texture constraint. An adaptive method for the horizontal and vertical aligned text lines determination is then designed according to the run length of the horizontal and vertical block numbers. The remaining block regions are further verified by local block texture constraints. And the text block region can be localized by virtue of the horizontal and vertical block texture projections. Finally, a foreground and background integrated (FBI) video text segmentation approach is adopted in this paper to eliminate the complex background in text regions. The final experimental results show the effectiveness of our methods","1520-6149;15206149","POD:1-4244-0469-X","10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660360","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1660360","","Asia;Discrete cosine transforms;Image edge detection;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;Optical character recognition software;Speech analysis;Videos","data compression;discrete cosine transforms;image texture;object detection;text analysis;video coding","DCT;MPEG coding techniques;block texture constraint;compressed videos;foreground and background integrated;indexing;retrieval;semantic-based video analysis;text detection;vertical aligned text lines determination;video text information;video text localization;video text segmentation","","2","","9","","","14-19 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Feature reduction is commonly applied as a preprocessing step to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis (ULDA) was recently proposed for feature reduction. The extracted features via ULDA were shown to be statistically Uncorrelated, which is desirable for many applications. In this paper, an algorithm called ULDA/QR is proposed to simplify the previous implementation of ULDA. Then, the ULDA/GSVD algorithm is proposed, based on a novel optimization criterion, to address the singularity problem which occurs in undersampled problems, where the data dimension is larger than the sample size. The criterion used is the regularized version of the one in ULDA/QR. Surprisingly, our theoretical result shows that the solution to ULDA/GSVD is independent of the value of the regularization parameter. Experimental results on various types of data sets are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and to compare it with other commonly used feature reduction algorithms","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1683768","Feature reduction;QR-decomposition;generalized singular value decomposition.;uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis","Bioinformatics;Data mining;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Principal component analysis;Singular value decomposition","data mining;feature extraction;optimisation;principal component analysis;singular value decomposition","bioinformatics;data mining;feature reduction;machine learning;optimization criterion;singularity problem;uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis","","50","","31","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The secret key shared between all 802.11 devices can be retrieved by attackers which are passively collecting data over the wireless network. TKIP, which solves this problem by periodically refreshing the keys between the access points and the wireless clients, has been standardized. But 802.11 ad-hoc networks remain unsafe.

The lifetime of these networks is severely curtailed by the limited battery power of the sensors. One line of research in sensor network lifetime management has examined sensor selection techniques, in which applications judiciously choose which sensors' data should be retrieved and are worth the expended energy. In the past, many ad-hoc approaches for sensor selection have been proposed. In this paper, we argue that sensor selection should be based upon a tradeoff between application-perceived benefit and energy consumption of the selected sensor set. We propose a framework wherein the application can specify the utility of measuring data (nearly) concurrently at each set of sensors. The goal is then to select a sequence of sets to measure whose total utility is maximized, while not exceeding the available energy. Alternatively, we may look for the most cost-effective sensor set, maximizing the product of utility and system lifetime. This approach is very generic, and permits us to model many applications of sensor networks. We proceed to study two important classes of utility functions: submodular and supermodular functions. We show that the optimum solution for submodular functions can be found in polynomial time, while optimizing the cost-effectiveness of supermodular functions is NP-hard. For a practically important subclass of supermodular functions, we present an LP-based solution if nodes can send for different amounts of time, and show that we can achieve an O(log n) approximation ratio if each node has to send for the same amount of time. Finally, we study scenarios in which the quality of measurements is naturally expressed in terms of distances from targets. We show that the utility-based approach is analogous to a penalty-based approach in those scenarios, and present preliminary results on some practically important special cases","","POD:1-59593-334-4","10.1145/1127777.1127783","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662435","","Batteries;Energy consumption;Energy management;Energy measurement;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Polynomials;Sensor systems;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","monitoring;telecommunication network management;wireless sensor networks","NP-hard;sensor network lifetime management;wireless link","","32","","33","","","19-21 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a novel approach for assigning semantic labels to image segments, which together segment layout information can lead to content-based image classification and retrieval. The proposed approach relies on a perceptually based, spatially adaptive, color-texture segmentation scheme. We derive segment-wide features (color and spatial texture). These features serve as medium level descriptors that can effectively bridge the ""semantic gap"" between low and high level descriptors. The segment classification into semantic categories is based on linear discriminant analysis techniques.
