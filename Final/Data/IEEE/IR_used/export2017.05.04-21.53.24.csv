Our work addresses two issues. One is the extraction of information that enables reduction of the data from multi-spectral images into a number of features. Second is the organization and selection of the features that would allow flexible and scalable discovery of the knowledge from the databases of remotely sensed images. The VisiMine architecture distinguishes between three types of feature vectors: pixel, region and tile. One of the challenges in information retrieval is the proper choice of the set of features that are the best suited for a data mining task. The VisiMine system enables extraction of a large number of features that describe textural and spectral properties of satellite information, in addition to the analysis of image information, the system can perform data fusion of image properties with auxiliary data such as DEM. Tilton et al. (2002) presented the results of the information retrieval experiments with the Hierarchical Segmentation (HSEG) algorithm that produces a hierarchical set of image segmentations. The results presented showed that the use of HSEG features improves the precision and recall of similarity searches. However, for different types of land cover, different combinations of HSEG segmentation levels and textural features provided the best results. Image analysis applications often require different levels of image segmentation detail as well as the use of different mixes of spectral, textural and shape features combined together with auxiliary information. Furthermore, a particular application may require different features and different levels of image segmentation detail depending on how the image objects are being analyzed. Thus, an automatic selection of feature sets would be very useful for satellite image analysis. In this paper, we present algorithms that allow for automatic selection of features for region and tile similarity searches. The relevance feedback technique allows for selective choices to be made in the region(s) of interest for which a good subset of features may be found in real time. The preliminary results of the experiments with LANDSAT data show improvements in both prec- ision and recall over previously used methods.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1295239","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1295239","","Data analysis;Data mining;Feedback;Image analysis;Image databases;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Satellites;Spatial databases;Tiles","data mining;feature extraction;geographic information systems;geophysical signal processing;image segmentation;relevance feedback;sensor fusion","LANDSAT data;VisiMine project;data fusion;data mining;feature extraction;hierarchical segmentation algorithm;image segmentation;information retrieval;multispectral images;relevance feedback;satellite image databases;satellite information;spectral properties;textural properties","","3","1","3","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Surface scattering is shown to be dependent on the cell size to correlation length ratio. SAR resolution is taken into account by dividing a surface spectrum in two parts: a low-frequency spectrum corresponding to local slopes and a high-frequency component, defining the roughness inside a resolution cell. Backscattering coefficients are calculated for each resolution cell with the IEM model using local incidence angles. Surface scattering is characterized with three polarimetric indicators H/A/Î±_, highly related to the soil characteristics. These models are validated on indoor polarimetric SAR measurements acquired at the JRC laboratory.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1293802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1293802","","Frequency;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Probability density function;Rough surfaces;Scattering;Soil;Spatial resolution;Surface roughness","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;radar polarimetry;radar resolution;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","IEM model;SAR resolution;backscattering coefficients;correlation length ratio;high-frequency component;indoor polarimetric SAR measurements;local incidence angles;local slopes;low-frequency spectrum;polarimetric SAR data;polarimetric indicators;polarimetric scattering characteristics;resolution cell size;roughness;soil characteristics;surface parameters retrieval;surface scattering","","4","","10","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As part of a large-scale hydrology experiment (SMEX02) an extensive VWC data set was collected for corn and soybeans over a portion of the growth cycle. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for several dates were used to develop two indices, the well-known NDVI and the NDWI, for each ground sampling site. Since multiple dates and satellites were used, atmospheric correction and cross calibration was performed on each TM image. Two atmospheric correction models, 6S and MODTRAN, and an empirical method, produced comparable results. Comparisons of VWC and the indices showed that the NDVI saturated at a lower VWC than did the NDWI. This indicates that the NDWI is a better index for use in estimating the VWC over a full crop growing cycle. Relationships were developed between the VWC and NDWI for corn and soybeans. The error with this approach was approximately 0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for corn and 0.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for soybeans.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1294609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294609","","Atmospheric modeling;Content based retrieval;Hydrology;Information retrieval;Instruments;Laboratories;Remote sensing;Satellites;Soil moisture;Vegetation mapping","agriculture;vegetation mapping;water","Landsat Thematic Mapper data;MODTRAN;atmospheric correction;corn;cross calibration;normalized difference water index;scale hydrology experiment;soybeans;vegetation water content","","4","","10","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Model based inversion is one of the main LAI retrieval methods, and the multi-angle data are the important data sets. However, the general model-fitting algorithm is time consuming in LAI inversion. In this paper, we proposed a kernel-driven model and neural network based LAI inversion algorithm to speed the process. The data obtained by the new Airborne Multi-angle Thermal/Visible Imaging System (AMTIS) is synchronous and has higher resolution. Compared with the low-resolution multi-angle data such as MISR and MODIS, it has a resolution as high as 1.36 m. Using the kernel-driven model, the BRF was reconstructed from the AMTIS data. On the other hand, a 3-dimension radiative transfer model and the measured parameters were used to model the BRF. Then LAI was inversed based on the neural network. Synchronous ground-based measurements of LAI for wheat were taken in Shunyi to validate our method. Some conclusions from the study: (1) LAI can be retrieved successfully using the high-resolution multi-angle data based on neural network; (2) based on the neural network and the kernel-driven model, the inversion rate can be improved; (3) by adjusting the soil moisture classification, the inversion precision can be improved.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1295303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1295303","","Biosensors;High-resolution imaging;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Information retrieval;MODIS;Neural networks;Optical imaging;Remote sensing;Soil moisture","forestry;geophysical techniques;neural nets;vegetation mapping","AMTIS;Airborne Multiangle Thermal-Visible Imaging System;Beijing;China;LAI inversion algorithm;Shunyi;airborne multi-angle high resolution sensor;algorithm;biophysical parameter;kernel-driven model;neural network;remote sensing;soil moisture classification;wheat","","0","","11","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For such scattering media, the scattering phase center (SPC) height, as measured by SRTM, is a function of tree height, incidence angle, and the extinction coefficient of the medium. The extinction coefficient for uniform tree stands is calculated as a function of tree height and density using allometric equations and a fractal tree model. The algorithm outputs tree height estimates that are significantly closer to the true tree height than the raw SRTM SPC height values obtained from the height difference between the SRTM data and the National Elevation Dataset (NED).

To build the simulated database, emissivity values have been used. An experimental investigation has been made in order to determine the angular variation of the infrared emissivity as a well-known parameter to estimate ST in multiangular methods. The results show a general decrease of the emissivity with increasing viewing angles. Finally, the proposed algorithms have been applied to a series of satellite images acquired by the CSIRO in Australia, retrieving LST with a standard deviation less than 0.6 K if the satellite data are error free; in this case, the emissivity and temperature values necessary to retrieve the ST have been acquired from CSIRO in situ data.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1295540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1295540","","Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Ocean temperature;Radiometry;Satellite broadcasting;Sea surface;Surface waves;Temperature distribution","algorithm theory;emissivity;errors;geophysical techniques;infrared spectra;spectral methods of temperature measurement","11 micron;12 micron;AATSR data;Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer;Australia;angular effect;infrared emissivity;multiangular algorithms;satellite data;satellite images;surface emissivity;surface temperature;thermal infrared","","0","","3","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, measurements of the top-of-atmosphere reflectance in the oxygen absorption A-band are used. The technique is based on the asymptotic radiative transfer theory as applied to studies of the oxygen absorption bands in reflected light. Our approach is valid for optically thick clouds with cloud optical thickness larger than approximately 5. The accuracy of the algorithm is checked against independent retrieval techniques for completely cloudy pixels. In particular, the close coincidence with data obtained from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR-2) onboard ERS-2 is found. Some results of retrievals using these different instruments disagree (up to 2 km). This is explained by the strong horizontal inhomogeneity of clouds under investigation, which is not accounted by the SACURA or, possibly, by well-known problems of infrared techniques as applied to low-level clouds. The effective cloud geometrical thickness l is also retrieved. This parameter is defined as the geometrical thickness of a vertically homogeneous cloud, which allows for the minimization of differences between observed and calculated top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectra. For inhomogeneous clouds, the value of l differs from a real cloud geometrical thickness, but it gives us an indication of the possible existence of the multilayered cloud system in the field of view of the optical instrument.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.825586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1298971","Clouds;radiative transfer;remote sensing;spectroscopy","Absorption;Clouds;Earth;Information retrieval;Instruments;Optical sensors;Particle measurements;Reflectivity;Remote sensing;Satellite broadcasting","atmospheric optics;atmospheric spectra;atmospheric techniques;clouds;optical radar;radiative transfer;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar","A-band;ATSR-2;Along Track Scanning Radiometer;ERS-2;Earth Remote Sensing satellite;GOME instrument;GOME reflectance spectra;Global Ozone Measurement Experiment;SACURA;cloud altitudes;cloud geometrical thickness;cloud optical thickness;cloud-top height determination;cloudy pixels;horizontal inhomogeneity;infrared techniques;multilayered cloud systems;optical instrument;optically thick clouds;oxygen absorption;radiative transfer;semianalytical cloud retrieval algorithm;top-of-atmosphere reflectance;vertically homogeneous cloud","","15","","26","","","May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm recursively estimates the similarity measure, which is used for data ranking in description environments where similarity-based queries are applied, using a set of relevant/irrelevant samples feedback by the user to the system so that the adjusted response is a better approximation of the current user's information needs and preferences. In particular, using concepts of functional analysis, the similarity measure is expressed as a parametric form of known monotone increasing functional components. Then, the contribution of each functional component to the similarity measure is estimated through a recursive and efficient on-line learning algorithm so that: 1) the current user's needs and preferences, as indicated by a set of selected relevant/irrelevant samples, are satisfied as much as possible, while simultaneously 2) a minimal modification of the already estimated similarity measure is accomplished. Experimental results on a large real-life database using objective evaluation criteria, such as the precision-recall curve and the average normalized modified retrieval rank (ANMRR), indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the compared ones. In addition, the proposed algorithm requires low computational complexity and it can be implemented in a recursive way.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2004.826752","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294957","","Approximation algorithms;Computational complexity;Content based retrieval;Current measurement;Databases;Feedback;Functional analysis;Information retrieval;Particle measurements;Recursive estimation","computational complexity;content-based retrieval;functional analysis;image processing;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);relevance feedback;visual databases","MPEG-7;average normalized modified retrieval rank;computational complexity;data ranking;functional analysis;functional components;generalized nonlinear relevance feedback algorithm;image retrieval;interactive content-based retrieval;objective evaluation criteria;online learning algorithm;precision-recall curve;real-life database","","8","","39","","","May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The NN is proved to be an effective method for retrieval problems; much effort has been devoted to it. In this study, our goal is to estimate the bare surface soil moisture and surface roughness at Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR/E) frequencies. First, a preliminary analysis was conducted based on a sensitivity analysis of surface parameters by simulating AMSR/E emissivity data of V, H polarizations, which were generated by the Integral Equation Model (IEM) for AMSR/E viewing angle of 55 degrees. We employed NNs to be first trained with part of the sensitive data determined by the above sensitivity analysis, then the trained NNs were used to retrieve the parameters that we need, especially soil moisture, from the simulated data. Analysis of the difference between the retrieved parameters and the simulated ones is presented. In addition, because the retrieval accuracy of NNs is supposed to be extremely sensitive to ""noise"" - the difference between the model and measurements, we introduced random noise to the simulated data. At the same time, we carried out a sensitive analysis of the input noise. We also selected the most sensitive frequencies, 6.9 and 10.7 GHz, to soil moisture in our retrieval scheme. This study demonstrates the great potential of NNs in estimating soil surface parameters from passive microwave remotely sensed data again.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1295301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1295301","","Analytical models;Frequency estimation;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Rough surfaces;Samarium;Sensitivity analysis;Soil moisture;Statistical analysis;Surface roughness","genetic algorithms;geophysical techniques;integral equations;microwave detectors;moisture measurement;neural nets;radiometry;remote sensing;sensitivity analysis;soil;surface roughness","10.7 GHz;6.9 GHz;genetic algorithm;integral equation model;microwave scanning radiometry;neural networks;passive microwave remote sensing;sensitivity analysis;soil moisture;soil surface parameters;surface roughness","","2","","11","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, high resolution, multi-spectral satellite data have been successfully applied in the detection of chemical, biological and physical processes developing in coastal waters, but they appear to be heavily penalized in the study of fast dynamical phenomena, due to their typically long revisiting time. At the same time, datasets from satellites for atmospheric and oceanic applications do have an appropriate revisiting time and an excellent spectral resolution, but generally are not considered suitable for coastal water studies, given their limited spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a preliminary evaluation of the utilization of oceanic sensors in the monitoring of coastal shallow waters. Among other parameters, we have measured the Chlorophyll-a concentration in the Taranto coastal waters, utilizing SeaWifS (SeaWide Field-of-view Sensor) data, as part of the SPICAMAR experiment conducted by environmental specialists, who have provided a very complete dataset relative to the ground (sea) truth. The ""Taranto Seas"" are three small water basins, nearly closed, with a total extension of about 55 km<sup>2</sup> and a small depth (7 m., 10 m. and 20 m. average depth respectively), located in southern Italy on the Ionian sea, very close to a large town and an important industrial settlement. Due to the low extension of the area of interest an important source of errors derived from pixels marginally contaminated by coastal land reflectivity. This effect has been partially eliminated trough a very accurate geo-referencing and selection of each single pixel to be used for the evaluation. A radiative transfer code has been used to remove the atmospheric effect by SeaWiFS image. To retrieval chlorophyll concentration we have implemented a semianalytic algorithms. The performance of these procedure and algorithms are presented to show the potential use and the limits of oceanic sensors for coastal waters monitoring.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1294576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294576","","Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Industrial pollution;Information retrieval;Remote monitoring;Remote sensing;Satellites;Sea measurements;Spatial resolution;Urban pollution;Water pollution","oceanographic techniques;oceanography;remote sensing","7 to 20 m;Ionian sea;SPICAMAR;SeaWiFS image;SeaWifS data;Taranto Seas;Taranto coastal area;Taranto coastal waters;atmospheric applications;atmospheric effect;chlorophyll a concentration;coastal shallow waters monitoring;eutrophication phenomena;oceanic applications;oceanic sensors;pollution detection;radiative transfer code;remote sensed data;revisiting time;seawide field of view sensor data;semianalytic algorithms;southern Italy;spatial resolution;spectral resolution","","0","","9","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we apply the AFIRS to the mapping of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) tracts in Texas County, Oklahoma. CRP is a nationwide program, and recently USDA announced payments of nearly $1.6 billion for new CRP enrollments. It is imperative to obtain accurate CRP maps for effective and efficient management and evaluation of the CRP program. However, most existing CRP maps are inaccurate and little work has been done to improve their accuracy. The proposed AFIRS is capable of handling the complex CRP mapping problem with high accuracy when limited training samples are available. Simulation results show that 5-10% improvements can be obtained by incorporating GIS ancillary data and other derived features in addition to multispectral imagery.

The bi-dimensional surfaces are described by means of the fractional Brownian motion random process, using the bi-dimensional wavelet transform. Multi-scale roughness is characterized by two parameters, the first one proportional to the standard deviation and the other one related to the fractal dimension. Soil moisture is related to the complex dielectric constant. To simulate radar backscattering we used the small perturbation model in which the radar backscattering coefficient can be expressed as the product of two factors, the first dependent on polarisation but independent of surface roughness and vice versa the second dependent on roughness but independent of polarisation. Thus, this model simplifies the procedure of inversion and the co-polarised ratio between hh and vv polarisation is independent of roughness and a minimisation over only two parameters is performed to retrieve the complex dielectric constant independently of the employed geometric surface description. Once the dielectric constant is known, the retrieval of multi-scale surface roughness parameters is performed in a successive step by using multi-frequency and multi-incident angle data.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1295286","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1295286","","Backscatter;Dielectric constant;Information retrieval;Inverse problems;Polarization;Radar;Rough surfaces;Soil moisture;Solid modeling;Surface roughness","backscatter;dielectric polarisation;fractals;geomorphology;inverse problems;moisture;permittivity;soil;wavelet transforms","SPM;bidimensional surfaces;bidimensional wavelet transform;complex dielectric constant;dielectric parameters;fractal dimension;fractional Brownian motion random process;geometric surface;inverse model;multifrequency data;multiincident angle data;multiscale roughness parameters;natural rough surfaces;numerical inversion;radar backscattering;radar backscattering coefficient;retrieve roughness geometry;small perturbation model;soil moisture;surface roughness","","0","","13","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ease of access to this digital library among collaborators would be beneficial for future research studies. A friendly environment for retrieving the required information is a key component of the information system infrastructure of modern research projects. Due to the rapid growth of the global Internet, researchers are demanding an improvement of traditional techniques for storage of data in order to get required information in a convenient fashion. This feature is prototypical of web databases; thus they are widely used for their excellent capability of securely sharing data and providing fast access to on-line information. We have developed a web database in order to facilitate access to a valuable, decades-long collection of data: over 3000 normal ECGs from neonates, infants, adolescents and adults along with information about their age and sex. Patient name, ID, and personal information are kept confidential. A mean P, QRS, T cycle together with the usual fiducial points, wave durations, and interval measurements are available. This application is built around a three-tier architecture model using open source software. The base of the application (third tier) consists of the database management system. MySQL is used for this purpose. Built on the top of the third tier is the second tier that contains most of the application logic, which is achieved by using PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). Apache web server is used to facilitate communication between tiers. The first tier (client) is typically web browser software that interacts with the application. This system provides the facility to acquire ECGs by features of interest, i.e., age, sex, heart rate, etc. Security is afforded by restricting access to research collaborators only. This web database provides a user-friendly environment for ease of data access, and has resulted in a significant improvement in the data retrieval rate. One early application has clearly demonstrated the divergence in selected ECG measurements in children and adolescents at about the time of puberty.","0276-6547;02766547","POD:0-7803-8170-X","10.1109/CIC.2003.1291143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291143","","Application software;Collaboration;Electrocardiography;Information retrieval;Information systems;Internet;Pediatrics;Prototypes;Software libraries;Spatial databases","Internet;SQL;database management systems;digital libraries;electrocardiography;hypermedia;medical information systems;open systems;paediatrics;security of data","Apache web server;ECG web database;Internet;MySQL;PHP Hypertext Preprocessor;Structured Query language;adolescents;adults;data storage;database management system;digital library;electrocardiograms;heart rate;infants;information retrieval;information system infrastructure;neonates;open source software;patient name;personal information;puberty;secure data sharing","","12","","15","","","21-24 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Target variables included surface temperature, Leaf Area Index (LAI), canopy biomass, leaf water content, canopy height, canopy structure and soil properties. The imaging spectrometers used for DAISEX were the DAIS-7915, HyMap and POLDER. The campaign took place during the summers of 1998, 1999 and 2000 in Barrax (Spain) and Colmar (France). A new algorithm is under development for the atmospheric correction of the hyperspectral and multiangular data acquired during this campaign. This algorithm is intended to improve the current atmospheric correction by taking into account the coupling between atmosphere and surface (including a non-Lambertian treatment of the latter). Moreover, the hyperspectral data allow to characterise in detail the absorption and the multiangular characteristics of the data allow to describe accurately the aerosol scattering. The method consists in identifying some pixels on an image with an a priori information about its BRDF and assume that the atmosphere is the same over the whole image. Applying a radiative transfer code we can reproduce the reflectance measured by the sensor by modifying the parameters describing the surface and the aerosols through an iterative process. Once the atmosphere is known the system atmosphere-surface is uncoupled and the reflectance for the whole image can be obtained.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1293689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1293689","","Aerosols;Atmosphere;Biomass;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Reflectivity;Spectroscopy;Temperature","aerosols;atmospheric techniques;radiative transfer","AD 1998 to 2000;Barrax;Colmar;DAIS-7915;DAISEX;Digital Airborne Spectrometer Experiment;France;HyMap;POLDER;Spain;atmospheric aerosols;atmospheric correction;biophysical variables;canopy biomass;canopy height;canopy structure;geophysical variable;hyperspectral data;imaging spectrometer data;iterative process;leaf area index;leaf water content;multiangular data;nonLambertian treatment;radiative transfer code;soil property;surface reflectance;surface temperature","","0","","7","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Electromagnetic simulations of the radar signal are an essential step to understand the influence of such parameters on the back-scattered signal.

Obviously, there is a tendency for JPEG2000 to take the place of JPEG, and large amount of images are saved in JPEG2000 format in image databases and on the Internet in the near future. So, research on image retrieval realized in JPEG2000 compressed domain has important real significance. In this paper, the data structure in JPEG2000 compressed domain is firstly analyzed. The concept of information tree and a novel tree-distance measurement are then proposed. Finally, we propose a new image retrieval method in JPEG2000 compressed domain.

The use of the W-bandsignal will provide accurate measurement of the vertical air motion in rain. Considering the conditions of heavy rain in which case large nonspherical raindrops exist, the actual drop's shapes will be corrected. Data will be processed as suggested by Firda et al., 1999. This research's goal is to develop software to retrieve several cloud characterization parameters, such as drop size distribution and vertical air motion from collected data during November 2001 at the Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) site in Lamont, Oklahoma.

As is well-known, to retrieve land surface temperature from remotely sensed data, land surface emissivities are needed due to the nondeterministic nature of the temperature/emissivity separation from thermal infrared measurements: if thermal radiation is measured in N spectral bands, there will be N+1 unknowns (N emissivities and a single surface temperature). In this paper, two methods to estimate land surface emissivity from the Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS) sensor are considered: the temperature/emissivity separation method (TES) developed by Gillespie et al. (1998), in which thermal infrared data are needed, and the NDVI thresholds method (NDVI<sup>THM</sup>) developed by Sobrino et al. (2001), in which visible and near-infrared data are also needed. Once the LSE has been estimated, LST can be retrieved using a single-channel or two-channel method using only one thermal channel or a combination of two thermal channels respectively. These methods usually use the atmospheric water vapor content as input data, sp a method based on the ratios between absorbent and transparent bands in the red and near-infrared region to estimate atmospheric water vapor is also presented. The final results obtained for the validation carried out over the Barrax test site (Albacete, Spain) in the framework of the DAISEX (DAIS experiment) campaigns supported by ESA show deviations of around 0.01 for LSE and deviations between 1 K and 1.5 K for LST.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1294012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294012","","Image sensors;Information retrieval;Infrared spectra;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Least squares approximation;Optical imaging;Spectroscopy;Temperature sensors;Testing","airborne radar;atmospheric humidity;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;infrared spectrometers;remote sensing by radar","Albacete;Barrax test site;DAIS bands;DAIS experiment;DAIS sensor;DAISEX;NDVI threshold method;Spain;TES;absorbent bands;atmospheric water vapor content;climate model;digital airborne imaging spectrometer;energy balance;land surface emissivity;land surface temperature;near-infrared data;remotely sensed data;single-channel method;temperature/emissivity separation;thermal infrared data;thermal radiation;transparent bands;two-channel method","","0","","10","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A combination of aircrafts carrying different sensors and flying in different configurations allowed to get a complete dataset of hyperspectral and multiangular data acquired simultaneously, together with the necessary atmospheric information and ground data needed for validation of biophysical retrievals. A two-years study funded by ESA has exploited in depth the DAISEX dataset to evaluate the accuracy achieved in the retrieval of each one of the different vegetation properties, by using different methods applied over the same dataset.

It has been shown in past studies that the enhanced ozone in the PBL during an episode could increase the value of the TOR by as much as 10 DU. However, it also has been shown that there is poor correspondence between the daily surface ozone concentration and the TOR and between daily values of the vertically-integrated ozone in the troposphere using ozonesonde data and the TOR. Best correspondence between surface ozone and the TOR and between daily values of the vertically-integrated ozone in the troposphere using ozonesonde data and the TOR was found in monthly, seasonal, and annual average data. The question remains is there a relationship between the TOR and the ozone in the lower troposphere and when is the ozone in the lower troposphere a significant contributor to the value and distribution of the TOR. In this study, we have attempted to develop some insight into what vertical levels in the troposphere provided the principal contribution to the distribution of the TOR. In particular, the study examined how the ozone distribution in the lower, middle or upper troposphere contributed to the TOR and its distribution. In order to accomplish the objective of this study, ozone data from simulations using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Models-3 Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model were combined with TOMS/SBUV TOR data for a case study in July 1988.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1294476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294476","","Aerosols;Backscatter;Helium;Information retrieval;Protection;Remote sensing;Spectroscopy;Terrestrial atmosphere","air pollution;atmospheric composition;ozone;remote sensing;troposphere","AD 1988 07;Community Multiscale Air Quality;O<sub>3</sub>;PBL;SBUV;Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet remote sensing system;TOMS;TOR;Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer;Tropospheric Ozone Residual;United States Environmental Protection Agency;ozone concentration;ozonesonde data;planetary boundary layer;regional air quality model;stratospheric ozone;surface ozone;troposphere","","1","","12","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then binarization module is set to favor character recognition, where some post-processing is taken to remove white-dot noise and fill the holes in the strokes. Finally the binarized image should be segmented and fed to OCR module so that the characters of the day marking can be recognized. Simulations show the effectiveness of our method.","","POD:0-7803-8185-8","10.1109/ICICS.2003.1292562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292562","","Character generation;Character recognition;Data mining;Gray-scale;Image edge detection;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Optical character recognition software","colour photography;image retrieval;image segmentation;indexing;optical character recognition","OCR module;R-component domain;binarized image segmentation;color photograph;day marking detection;gray-scale morphologic method;natural photo;optical character recognition","","0","","6","","","15-18 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But compared with many of the microwave scattering and emission models, no more attention has been paid in this field. A database with simulated microwave backscattering coefficients and emissivities has been constructed under various surface roughness and soil moisture conditions by employing the IEM along with other well-known models. At first step, only Gaussian roughness distribution and small to moderate rough surface is considered. Under rougher conditions, shadowing function has been involved. By analyzing this database, we find out that in some certain ranges, microwave emissivities can be deduced from backscattering coefficients through surface rms slope and rms heights, though their relationship may not certainly be linear. And it also been shown this relationship is independent with soil water content. Therefore, by using empirical or semi-empirical passive models, soil moisture can be retrieved from backscattering coefficients with a satisfactory accuracy. Error analysis and verification using field observations is also given in the paper. By doing such a research, we hope to give an insight into the interaction mechanism between active and passive microwave sensing and also a new algorithm to retrieve land surface parameters through synergism.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1293963","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1293963","","Backscatter;Data analysis;Databases;Information retrieval;Land surface;Rough surfaces;Scattering;Shadow mapping;Soil moisture;Surface roughness","data acquisition;hydrological techniques;microwave imaging;soil;terrain mapping","Gaussian roughness distribution;IEM;bare soil surface;empirical passive models;error analysis;field observations;interaction mechanism;land surfaces;microwave emission models;microwave emissivities;microwave radiation;microwave scattering models;retrieval algorithm;semiempirical passive models;shadowing function;simulated microwave backscattering coefficients;soil moisture conditions;soil moisture retrieval;surface rms slope;surface roughness;synergistic active passive microwave data","","0","","6","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The latter has the advantage of independence on weather conditions, constant illumination and neglectable atmospheric disturbances. On the other hand, the artificial laboratory light sources usually are less parallel and less homogeneous than the clear sky solar illumination. In order to compare these two types of measurements (or replace one by the other) a careful correction of the data (BRDF retrieval) with respect to the mentioned sources of error is necessary. For the field case, this can be done following the well known procedures proposed by Martonchick and others. The purpose of this paper is to present our laboratory goniometer system and a corresponding BRDF retrieval solution. The RSL laboratory goniometer system (LAGOS) is based on the field goniometer (FIGOS) with the addition of a 1000 W brightness-stabilized quartz tungsten halogen lamp and lens system, placed in a dark room for minimization of stray light. The inhomogeneity of the illuminated area has been directly measured and found to be within 10% mean deviation for the zenith position. A simulation of the complete geometry of LAGOS, including the angular distributions and inhomogeneity of the light source as well as the changing position of the radiometer footprint allows us to estimate the measurement error for any target with known BRDF. The same algorithm can be used as core for the BRDF retrieval.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1295536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1295536","","Atmospheric measurements;Error correction;Goniometers;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Level measurement;Light sources;Lighting;Performance evaluation;Reflectivity","brightness;filament lamps;goniometers;light sources;measurement errors;optical radar;photoreflectance;quartz;radiometers;radiometry;stray light;target tracking;tungsten","1000 W;BRDF retrieval;FIGOS;LAGOS;Martonchick;RSL laboratory goniometer system simulation;angular distributions;artificial laboratory light sources;brightness-stabilized quartz tungsten halogen lamp;constant illumination;dark room;field goniometer;ground level measurements;lens system;light source inhomogeneity;measurement error;neglectable atmospheric disturbances;radiometer footprint;stray light;surface directional reflectance properties;weather condition","","2","","5","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The representation can be visualized as a 2-D surface, where ""hills"" and ""valleys"" represent contour convexities and concavities, respectively. The optimal matching of two shape representations is achieved using dynamic programming and a dissimilarity measure is defined based on this matching. The proposed algorithm is very efficient and invariant to several kinds of transformations including some articulations and modest occlusions. The retrieval performance of the approach is illustrated using the MPEG-7 shape database, which is one of the most complete shape databases currently available. Our experiments indicate that the proposed representation is well suited for object indexing and retrieval in large databases.

Both the dimensionality and the amount of data that needs to be processed are increasing rapidly. Reducing the dimension of the feature vectors to enhance the performance of the underlying technique is a popular solution to the infamous curse of dimensionality. We expect the techniques to have good quality of distance measures when the similarity distance between two feature vectors is approximated by some notion of distance between two lower-dimensional transformed vectors. Thus, it is desirable to develop techniques resulting in accurate approximations to the original similarity distance. We investigate dimensionality reduction techniques that directly target minimizing the errors made in the approximations. In particular, we develop dynamic techniques for efficient and accurate approximation of similarity evaluations between high-dimensional vectors based on inner-product approximations. Inner-product, by itself, is used as a distance measure in a wide area of applications such as document databases. A first order approximation to the inner-product is obtained from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We extend this idea to higher order power symmetric functions of the multidimensional points. We show how to compute fixed coefficients that work as universal weights based on the moments of the probability density function of the data set. We also develop a dynamic model to compute the universal coefficients for data sets whose distribution is not known. Our experiments on synthetic and real data sets show that the similarity between two objects in high-dimensional space can be accurately approximated by a significantly lower-dimensional representation.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294892","65;Inner-product approximation;dimensionality reduction;high-dimensional data.;p{hbox{-}}rm NORMS;similarity search","Area measurement;Discrete Fourier transforms;Discrete cosine transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Fourier transforms;Information retrieval;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Multidimensional systems;Multimedia databases;Spatial databases","distributed databases;statistical distributions","Cauchy-Schwarz inequality;dimensionality reduction;distributed databases;high-dimensional data;inner-product approximation;multidimensional data;similarity search;statistical distributions","","20","","43","","","June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the myth about the power of visual-feature-based indexing was quickly diminished as such features are far from representing semantic visual contents and producing meaningful indexes. One solution is to apply relevance feedback to refine queries or similarity measures in the search process and apply machine learning techniques to learn semantic annotations. In this paper, we address the key issues involved in relevance feedback of CBIR systems and review solutions to these issues. Based on these discussions, we present a relevance feedback and semantic learning framework for CBIR.

Conventional binary labeling scheme requires a crisp decision to be made on the relevance of the retrieved images. However, user interpretation varies with respect to different information needs and perceptual subjectivity. In addition, users tend to learn from the retrieval results to further refine their information request. It is, therefore, inadequate to describe user's fuzzy perception of image similarity with crisp logic. In view of this, we propose a fuzzy relevance feedback approach which enables the user to make a fuzzy judgment for relevance ranking. A radial basis function (RBF) network with local modeling structure is used for similarity learning. Experimental results show that our system is more user-adaptive, and it can achieve better performance compared with other conventional retrieval systems which are based on hard-decision and global modeling.","","POD:0-7803-8185-8","10.1109/ICICS.2003.1292736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292736","","Art;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Focusing;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Labeling;Software libraries","content-based retrieval;fuzzy logic;image retrieval;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks;relevance feedback","binary labeling scheme;crisp decision;fuzzy logic;fuzzy relevance feedback approach;interactive content-based image retrieval systems;local modeling structure;radial basis function network;similarity learning","","1","","13","","","15-18 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the developed production line, stem volume can easily be retrieved within predefined forest stands or within homogeneous areas defined by segmentation of optical satellite images. In order to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the production line, CARABAS-II images have been collected and analyzed over a test area covering 25Ã25 km<sup>2</sup>. The major part of the area is owned by the Swedish forest company Holmen Skog AB. For coniferous forest stands, exhibiting normal forest production conditions, the accuracy in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) for estimation of forest stem volume is about 44 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> (22% of the average stem volume) in the range of 70-400 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>, using the developed production line.

The basic rationale for retrieving soil moisture from radiometric measurements is the assumption that the surface layer can be modeled as a dielectric medium. Its dielectric constant then depends on several physical parameters, including soil moisture; emissivities for various incidence angles are computed using Fresnel's formulas. Many controlled field experiments have demonstrated the validity of this approach. Scenes exist still (e.g., ice-covered or frozen surfaces, barren areas) where surface soil moisture is not a relevant concept. For such scenes, information should, however, be available on the complex dielectric constant itself. This paper shows that the dielectric constant cannot be fully retrieved from single-frequency multiangular data; it describes, however, a methodology that aims at retrieving in an optimized way the available information.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.821698","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1298975","Dielectric constant;radiometry;regularization;retrieval","Cardiology;Dielectric constant;Information retrieval;L-band;Layout;Meteorology;Microwave radiometry;Radiometers;Soil moisture;Surface soil","atmospheric techniques;data acquisition;emissivity;hydrological techniques;permittivity;radiometry;remote sensing;soil","Fresnel formulas;L-band;barren areas;cardioid model;dielectric constant;dielectric medium;emissivity;frozen surfaces;hydrology;ice-covered surfaces;incidence angles;meteorology;multiangular radiometric observations;physical parameters;radiometric measurements;radiometry;regularization;single-frequency multiangular data;spaceborne microwave radiometers;spatial scales;surface layer;surface soil moisture;temporal scales","","4","","14","","","May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Once the crown cover fraction is calculated, the background spectra of pixels that are partly covered by vegetation can be recovered under the assumption of linear spectra mixing. Using the above method, we've successfully retrieved the background information of a TM image of Colorado State.

Given that the inverse problem of recovering soil moisture from SAR observations doesn't have a unique solution, the proposed methods perform a probabilistic estimation of such parameter, finding solutions representative of an unknown probabilistic distribution such as the mean or the most probable solutions. The methods are a Neural Network based-methods and a Mixture Model method. The difference of the solution found by these methods are discussed.

Shipping and offshore industries are keen to obtain real-time and climatological information on wave period in the open ocean to assist the design of sea-going structures and maximise safety at sea. Similarly, wave period is relevant for short-to-medium term ocean and weather forecasting, and more broadly, to ocean circulation and climate research, given the reported dependence of atmosphere-ocean momentum transfer on some measure of sea state development. In principle, full ocean wave spectra can be obtained from satellite synthetic aperture radars (SAR), yet the systematic extraction of wave period information from SAR has so far not been pursued. Hence, global wave period information is presently available only through numerical wave models, and there remain concerns about the lack of large scale validation of the geographical distribution and temporal variability of the modelled ocean waves. Here, we propose that ocean wave period information can be retrieved with adequate accuracy using satellite altimeters. There is evidence that satellite altimeter data contain wave period information, in addition to that on wave height. The existence of sea state development effects on the retrieval of altimeter wind speed is well documented and a few earlier studies have already considered the development of altimeter wave period models. However, the sea state dependence in these semi-empirical models is complex, and in both cases, the datasets of collocated altimeter/buoy measurements used to develop the models spanned only a small range of environmental conditions. In this paper, we present preliminary results of a new, purely empirical, wave period algorithm developed on the basis of the largest to-date dataset of collocated altimeter/buoy spectra measurements. The empirical wave period model is validated using independent collocated altimeter/buoy data, and by computing global monthly wave climatology. These are compared with existing wave period climatologies derived from numerical wave models.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1294558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294558","","Atmospheric waves;Information retrieval;Marine safety;Numerical models;Ocean waves;Satellites;Sea measurements;Shipbuilding industry;Synthetic aperture radar;Weather forecasting","climatology;ocean waves;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;synthetic aperture radar;weather forecasting","SAR;atmosphere-ocean momentum transfer;climatology;geographical distribution;nadir altimeter data;ocean wave;ocean wave period measurement;ocean wave period retrieval;satellite synthetic aperture radars;shipping;weather forecasting","","0","","11","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Caching is a key technique for improving data retrieval performance of mobile clients, regardless of the data delivery mechanism. The emergence of robust peer-to-peer technologies now brings to reality what we call ""cooperative caching"" in which mobile clients can access data items from the cache in their neighboring peers, thereby adding a new dimension for data caching. This paper studies the system performance of a cooperative caching scheme, called COCA, in a hybrid data delivery environment, and proposes a cooperative cache replacement scheme, called CORE, for mobile systems. The performance of COCA and CORE schemes is evaluated through a number of simulated experiments. The experiment results show that COCA effectively improves the system performance in push-based and hybrid-data delivery environments, especially in a heavily-loaded environment. The results also indicate that CORE can further improve on the access latency and reduce the number of expensive server requests, which consume scarce pull-based bandwidth.","1087-4089;10874089","POD:0-7695-2135-5","10.1109/ISPAN.2004.1300461","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300461","","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Cooperative caching;Databases;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;System performance","cache storage;client-server systems;mobile computing;mobile radio","COCA;CORE;cooperative cache replacement;data access;data retrieval;database servers;hybrid data delivery environment;mobile clients;mobile environment;mobile support stations;mobile systems;peer-to-peer cooperative caching;point-to-point channels;pull-based channel;push-based channel;scalable broadcast channels;server requests","","2","1","14","","","10-12 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

LAI is closely related to plant transpiration, sunlight intercept, photosynthesis and Net Primary Productivity. Multiangular remote sensing is capable of providing more three-dimension information of vegetation, and it is powerful in solving the problem of the same object with different spectrum or vice versa. As a result, multiangular remote sensing and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model based inversion may be more suitable for Leaf Area index (LAI) retrieval over row crop canopies. However, it's still difficult to get LAI without enough a priori knowledge due to the underdetermined problems in inversion. We use the multispectral information to get the a priori estimation of LAI, and then perform BRDF model inversion. Different from the general one channel based BRDF model inversion methods, our new methods use the muiltiangular and multispectral data sets together to increase the available information in inversion, i.e., it is a synthetic method. From the inversion results we found that the new synthetic method is more effective in LAI inversion.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1295297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1295297","","Crops;Ecosystems;Geographic Information Systems;Geography;Information retrieval;Productivity;Remote sensing;Soil;Structural engineering;Vegetation mapping","agriculture;crops;ecology;image retrieval;remote sensing by radar;sunlight;vegetation mapping","AD 2001 04 to 05;channel based bidirectional reflectance distribution function model;leaf area index inversion;multiangular data sets;multiangular remote sensing;multispectral data sets;net primary productivity;photosynthesis;plant transpiration;sunlight intercept;synthetic method;terrestrial ecosystem;three-dimension information;vegetation canopy structure","","1","","12","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The effectiveness of the retrieval algorithm has been evaluated comparing its performance to that yielded by other instruments and inversion techniques.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1293772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1293772","","Algorithm design and analysis;Atmosphere;Atmospheric measurements;Information retrieval;Instruments;Neural networks;Remote monitoring;Satellites;Sensitivity analysis;Testing","atmospheric chemistry;atmospheric composition;atmospheric radiation;atmospheric spectra;atmospheric techniques;data acquisition;ozone;remote sensing;spectral analysis","ESA satellite ERS-2;GOME channels extraction;GOME optimum spectral channels;O<sub>3</sub>;automatic selection;electromagnetic modelling;inversion purposes;inversion techniques;neural networks;ozone concentration profiles;ozone vertical profiles retrieval;pruning algorithms;radiance measurements;retrieval algorithm;sensitivity analysis","","0","","8","","","21-25 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The structure of the Web is increasingly being used to improve organisation, search and analysis of information on the Web. In this paper, we describe how the Web structure together with our novel summarisation techniques can be applied to better represent knowledge in actual Web documents via the proposed semantic virtual documents (SVD). We will also outline our experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SVD with a prototype system called iSEARCH (intelligent search and review of cluster hierarchy) for Web content retrieval and mining. The experimental results confirm that the novel technique show promising qualities in content-based representation for Web documents to enhance Web content retrieval and mining.","","POD:0-7803-8185-8","10.1109/ICICS.2003.1292785","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292785","","Content based retrieval;Design for experiments;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Internet;Knowledge representation;Prototypes;Search engines;Visualization","Internet;content-based retrieval;data mining;virtual reality","SEARCH;SVD;Web content mining;Web content retrieval;Web documents;communications techniques;content-based representation technique;intelligent search and review of cluster hierarchy;semantic virtual documents","","2","2","11","","","15-18 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
