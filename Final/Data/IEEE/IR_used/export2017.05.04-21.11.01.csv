"Analysis of Minimum Distances in High-Dimensional Musical Spaces","M. Casey; C. Rhodes; M. Slaney","Goldsmiths Coll., Dept. of Comput., Univ. of London, London","IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","20080617","2008","16","5","1015","1028","We propose an automatic method for measuring content-based music similarity, enhancing the current generation of music search engines and recommended systems. Many previous approaches to track similarity require brute-force, pair-wise processing between all audio features in a database and therefore are not practical for large collections. However, in an Internet-connected world, where users have access to millions of musical tracks, efficiency is crucial. Our approach uses features extracted from unlabeled audio data and near-neigbor retrieval using a distance threshold, determined by analysis, to solve a range of retrieval tasks. The tasks require temporal features-analogous to the technique of shingling used for text retrieval. To measure similarity, we count pairs of audio shingles, between a query and target track, that are below a distance threshold. The distribution of between-shingle distances is different for each database; therefore, we present an analysis of the distribution of minimum distances between shingles and a method for estimating a distance threshold for optimal retrieval performance. The method is compatible with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-allowing implementation with retrieval times several orders of magnitude faster than those using exhaustive distance computations. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method on three contrasting music similarity tasks: retrieval of mis-attributed recordings (fingerprint), retrieval of the same work performed by different artists (cover songs), and retrieval of edited and sampled versions of a query track by remix artists (remixes). Our method achieves near-perfect performance in the first two tasks and 75% precision at 70% recall in the third task. Each task was performed on a test database comprising 4.5 million audio shingles.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2008.925883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4544816","audio shingles;distance distributions;locality-sensitive hashing;matched-filter distance;music similarity","Audio databases;Current measurement;Data mining;Feature extraction;Internet;Music information retrieval;Performance evaluation;Search engines;Spatial databases;Target tracking","audio signal processing;feature extraction;information retrieval","Internet-connected world;audio features;automatic method;content-based music similarity;features extraction;high-dimensional musical spaces;locality-sensitive hashing;minimum distances;music search engines;musical tracks;optimal retrieval;pair-wise processing;query track;remix artists;retrieval tasks;test database;text retrieval","","28","6","31","","","July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This new method baptized ScDMA - standing for Scattering Division Multiple Access - leads to unprecedented advantages [2]. Two important differences with usual communication systems have to be highlighted. Firstly, the usual flow of physical signals carrying information is changed. Even though information is sent by the source, the source does not emit any physical signal. Indeed, the receiver reads the information of the source by sending a signal and analyzing the reflected signal. Secondly, the channel is somehow controlled in a deterministic manner, while in usual communication systems the channel is uncontrolled and considered as random. These two differences have impacts on the theoretical limit performance. In particular the usual expression of the system capacity C is modified: the maximization of the average mutual information I(X; Y) has to be done not only on the input symbol probabilities P(X) but also on the conditional probabilities P(Y|X) since the channel itself can be controlled. In addition, the case of the multi-rate multi-user capacity leads to unexpected results.","2157-8095;21578095","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1429-1; POD:978-1-4244-1397-3","10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557641","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557641","","Communication systems;Control systems;Impedance;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;Multiaccess communication;Scattering parameters;Signal analysis;Voltage","multi-access systems;multiplexing","average mutual information;cable networks;communication systems;conditional probabilities;digital information;input symbol probabilities;multiplexing method;multirate multiuser capacity;scattering division multiple access;theoretical limits","","0","","7","","","24-29 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed approach allows us to extract relevant data as well as to exclude useless and misleading contents from an XML document. Essentially, it combines ontology reasoning with an approximate pattern-matching engine which searches for patterns in a flexible way (i.e. modulo renaming, insertion, and deletion of XML items) and ranks the results w.r.t. their cost. The filtering process is guided by the syntax as well as the semantics of the XML documents, since it relies on both the document structure and the onto- logical information to which the document is related. Such information is retrieved by querying (possibly remote) ontology reasoners. Our methodology has been implemented in the XPHIL system, which is written in Haskell. By using the XML benchmarking tool xmlgen, we have developed some scalable experiments which demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3163-2","10.1109/ICIW.2008.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545659","XML semantic filtering;ontology reasoning;query language","Data mining;Databases;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Matched filters;Ontologies;Pattern matching;Web and internet services;XML","XML;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","XML data;XML document;XML semantic filtering;declarative language;information filtering;ontological information;ontology reasoning;pattern-matching engine","","1","","18","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We define context as those factors that bound and surround a problem. Contrail develops context models using text analytics, semantic networks, and spreading activation techniques to facilitate information retrieval and collaboration. The former leverages a knowledge base (""shoebox"") of information items automatically maintained by Contrail. Items in this shoebox are tagged with their original context. This facilitates information retrieval, recall, and sharing among collaborators. Contrail has been focused on aiding intelligence analysts but is generally applicable to other knowledge workers.

The difficulties in Chinese natural language processing, such as segmentation, knock down both effectiveness and efficiency of text similarity computation. This paper addresses some challenges in Chinese text similarity computation, which are undergoing from Chinese linguistics, models and approaches used in information retrieval.

The theoretical contribution of the paper consists in the design of a task-oriented, bottom-up method which mimics perceptual grouping mechanisms for contour retrieval. The proposed approach is task-oriented because it embeds prior anatomical and procedural knowledge. From a practical standpoint, the proposed approach is of clinical relevance, since it allows for retrieving contours from images where the annotation is 'blended' with the image content. While new image annotation systems are able to store image content and annotations in a separate manner, many TRUS prostate databases still contain 'blended' annotations only.

This paper presents a novel approach that addresses this problem with the help of symbolic coordinates. It requires only a small amount of topology information distributed in the network and allows mobile devices to send messages to arbitrary areas. The routing task is split among the client nodes, which specify a symbolic source route, and the sensor nodes that handle node-to-node routing. The paper describes the algorithm, specific challenges associated with its design and gives an extensive evaluation of the approach and its properties, showing that the use of symbolic coordinates in these environments is a viable alternative to more traditional types of routing.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1797-1; POD:978-1-4244-1796-4","10.1109/COMSWA.2008.4554476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4554476","","Algorithm design and analysis;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Network topology;Pervasive computing;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","mobile computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;wireless sensor networks","mobile pervasive computing;network topology;routing message;symbolic coordinates;wireless sensor network","","3","","20","","","6-10 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The successful detection of both gradual and abrupt transitions is necessary to this end. In this paper a new gradual transition detection algorithm is proposed, based on novel features exhibiting less sensitivity to local or global motion than previously proposed ones. These features, each of which could serve as a stand-alone transition detection approach, are then combined using a machine learning technique, to result in a meta-segmentation scheme. Besides significantly improved performance, advantage of the proposed scheme is that there is no need for threshold selection, as opposed to what would be the case if any of the proposed features were used by themselves and as is typically the case in the relevant literature. Comparison of the proposed approach with four popular algorithms of the literature reveals the significantly improved performance of it.","1949-3983;19493983","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2044-5; POD:978-1-4244-2043-8","10.1109/CBMI.2008.4564927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564927","","Content based retrieval;Detection algorithms;Gunshot detection systems;Histograms;Indexing;Informatics;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Spatial databases;Telematics","image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);video databases;video retrieval;video signal processing","gradual transition detection;gradual transition detection algorithm;high-level video content analysis;machine learning technique;multiple criteria;video databases;video indexing;video retrieval;video shot meta-segmentation","","1","","11","","","18-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using new technology in conjunction with presence and location information, situational awareness can be considerably improved. Furthermore, it is studied how these concepts can be applied in urban operations. Location information, which may be included as extended presence information, is usually obtained from satellites, but in dense urban areas and particularly indoors, this is not possible. Thus, positioning methods based on mobile networks, radio frequency identification (RFID) and Wireless local area network (WLAN) are proposed for complementing the satellite based ones, even if their use may be quite limited. The work is a part of a study on how to apply Next Generation (Mobile) Network (NGN/NGMN) technology in military ad hoc network environments. There are also competing standards for presence, but because of easier integration with other services, and the inclusion of geographical data, this work concentrates on the use of the SIMPLE specifications session initiation protocol for instant messaging and presence leveraging extensions. Security aspects of the environment are considered. Both Internet and internet protocol multimedia substructure (IMS) network environment are studied.

In these memories the available redundancy is structured so as to protect individual lines rather than the entire memory as a whole. Often designers wish to read and write only parts of the memory line, as in some instances this leads to various favorable system design tradeoffs, including better power consumption, increased data access concurrency, etc. (alternatively one may say that designers sometimes would prefer smaller line sizes). Nevertheless when designing systems with such subline accesses it is often found that in order to mantain a given level of reliability, the total amount of redundancy allocated in the memory needs to be increased beyond desirable levels. In this work, we initiate a study of the problem of structuring error control codes to allow subline accesses with good tradeoffs between reliability and redundancy. We motivate and explore a setting in which a ""double-lookup"" protocol is used in conjunction with certain types of two-level codes, whereby error detection is attained in a first level and error correction using the second level is performed whenever errors are detected in the first level. We obtain lower bounds on redundancy for a given level of reliability and offer a code construction that attains this bound for a certain important class of parameters. We also introduce an alternate construction which allows us to find longer codes under restrictions of the Galois field size used in the codes.","2157-8095;21578095","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1429-1; POD:978-1-4244-1397-3","10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557599","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557599","","Access protocols;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Error correction;Error correction codes;Information retrieval;Power system protection;Power system reliability;Read-write memory;Redundancy","Galois fields;error correction codes;storage management","Galois field;data access concurrency;double-lookup protocol;error control codes;memories protection;memory reliablity;power consumption;subline accesses","","19","2","7","","","24-29 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These typical techniques fail in many typical forensic analysis scenarios such as needing to deal with embedded data, such as with Microsoft Word files, or file fragments. The SADI (Statistical Analysis Data Identification) technique applies statistical analysis of the byte values of the data in such a way that the accuracy of the technique does not rely on the potentially misleading metadata information but rather the values of the data itself. The development of SADI provides the capability to identify what digitally stored data actually represents and will also allow for the selective extraction of portions of the data for additional investigation; i.e., in the case of embedded data. Thus, our research provides a more effective type identification technique that does not fail on file fragments, embedded data types, or with obfuscated data.","","POD:978-0-7695-3171-7","10.1109/SADFE.2008.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545366","Data type identification;Digital Forensics","Computer science;Data encapsulation;Data engineering;Data mining;Digital forensics;Failure analysis;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Operating systems;Statistical analysis","criminal law;data structures;statistical analysis","Microsoft Word files;computer system;data byte value;data relevancy;data type identification;digital forensic analysis;digitally stored data;embedded data;file extension;file fragments;file type identification;magic keys;metadata information;obfuscated data;relevant information location;selective data portion extraction;statistical analysis","","6","1","20","","","22-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address the issues of responsiveness, energy consumption and bandwidth contention in wireless communications, an index has to minimize the search time and maintain a small storage overhead. A linear index structure based on the D-tree is used to support location dependent queries, which is reduced to planar point queries. In this paper, we propose a modified D-tree index structure for processing location dependent information focusing on window queries via wireless data broadcast in a mobile environment. Hilbert curve is used to reduce the data regions that have to be searched from the whole space. Filtering mechanisms are used to find the real answer set.

We envision the emergence of services that enable a community of mobile users carrying such resource-limited devices to query such information at remote locations in the field in which they collectively roam. One approach to implement such a service is directed placement and retrieval (DPR), whereby readings/queries about a specific location are routed to a node responsible for that location. In a mobile, potentially sparse setting, where end-to-end paths are unavailable, DPR is not an attractive solution as it would require the use of delay-tolerant (flooding-based store-carry-forward) routing of both readings and queries, which is inappropriate for applications with data freshness constraints, and which is incompatible with stringent device power/memory constraints. Alternatively, we propose the use of amorphous placement and retrieval (APR), in which routing and field monitoring are integrated through the use of a cache management scheme coupled with an informed exchange of cached samples to diffuse sensory data throughout the network, in such a way that a query answer is likely to be found close to the query origin. We argue that knowledge of the distribution of query targets could be used effectively by an informed cache management policy to maximize the utility of collective storage of all devices. Using a simple analytical model, we show that the use of informed cache management is particularly important when the mobility model results in a non-uniform distribution of users over the field. We present results from extensive simulations which show that in sparsely-connected networks, APR is more cost-effective than DPR, that it provides extra resilience to node failure and packet losses, and that its use of informed cache management yields superior performance.","2155-5486;21555486","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1776-6; POD:978-1-4244-1777-3","10.1109/SAHCN.2008.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557786","","Amorphous materials;Analytical models;Cache storage;Delay;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Memory management;Remote monitoring;Resilience;Routing","personal communication networks;sensor fusion;wireless sensor networks","amorphous placement;autonomous sensor;cache management scheme;collective storage;field monitoring;informed diffusion;mobile sensors;personal communication devices;resource-constrained sensor","","3","","37","","","16-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Kriging with an external drift algorithm is applied to ground-based SWE data to produce gridded SWE data that are used as the target of the neural network. An optimal division of the sample of available pixels is achieved by a self-organizing feature map. Prediction error is used for model selection and is assessed by bootstrap. It is shown that a committee of a network containing neural networks with different architectures can provide consistent SWE retrievals.

While tremendous progress has been made in the field of automatic fingerprint matching, latent fingerprint matching continues to be a difficult problem because the challenges involved in latent print matching are quite different from plain or rolled fingerprint matching. Poor quality of friction ridge impressions, small finger area and large non-linear distortion are some of the main difficulties in latent fingerprint matching. We propose a system for matching latent images to rolled fingerprints that takes into account the specific characteristics of the latent matching problem. In addition to minutiae, additional features like orientation field and quality map are also used in our system. Experimental results on the NIST SD27 latent database indicate that the introduction of orientation field and quality map to minutiae-based matching leads to good recognition performance despite the inherently difficult nature of the problem.

Continuous feature selection techniques assign continuous weights to each feature according to their relevance. In this paper, we propose a supervised method for continuous feature selection. The proposed method applies statistical association rules to find patterns relating low-level image features to high-level knowledge about the images, and it uses the patterns mined to determine the weight of the features. The feature weighting through the statistical association rules reduces the semantic gap that exists between low-level features and the high-level user interpretation of images, improving the precision of the content-based queries. Moreover, the proposed method performs dimensionality reduction of image features avoiding the ""dimensionality curse"" problem. Experiments show that the proposed method improves the precision of the query results up to 38%, indicating that statistical association rules can be successfully employed to perform continuous feature selection in medical image databases.","1063-7125;10637125","POD:978-0-7695-3165-6","10.1109/CBMS.2008.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4562000","content-based image retrieval;continuous feature selection;distance functions;similarity search;statistical association rules","Association rules;Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Medical diagnostic imaging","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;medical image processing;statistical analysis;visual databases","content-based query;content-based retrieval;continuous feature selection;image features;medical image database;statistical association rule","","1","","11","","","17-19 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Searching NOTAM data based on a geographic area is a missing component in today's widely used NOTAM Web services. Geospatially enabled NOTAM Web service was implemented providing a solution for location-based searches against databases. Upon subscribing to a topic on the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), where Airspace Volumes of Interest (AVOI) are published, client invoked the search method by passing AVOI data in possible 3 different shapes, point, cylinder, and polygon. Projecting 3D AVOI onto 2D map and executing the retrieval by employing ""point in polygon"", ""point in circle"" and ""compare points"" methods was the procedure that took place on the server side. The outcome was a number of airports with NOTAM data available. The response was passed as a SOAP message over HTTP to client. Upon receiving, NOTAM data was displayed in a tabular form as well as graphical map providing visual support. In addition, topic publishing AVOI was secured using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and web service was secured using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) token implementing Role Based Access Control (RBAC). Only those with proper keys were able to subscribe to the topic, as well as only those with credentials were allowed to invoke the web service. This implementation has been adapted to a test case where hurricane is approaching. With this test case, airmen have been informed about the threat and provided with tools to make time-critical decisions in order to determine airports at risk and possible mitigation options for reliever efforts.","2155-4943;21554943","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2304-0; POD:978-1-4244-2303-3","10.1109/ICNSURV.2008.4559162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559162","","Airports;Databases;Information retrieval;Search methods;Shape;Simple object access protocol;Testing;Time factors;Web server;Web services","Web services;airports;information services;public key cryptography","3D AVOI;NOTAM data;SOAP message;Web services;airports;airspace volumes of interest;aviation databases;enterprise service bus;geographic area;geospatially enabled aviation;location-based searches;public key infrastructure;role based access control;security assertion markup language","","0","","2","","","5-7 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a novel query expansion technique that has phrases as its expansion unit. Phrases typically have a higher information content and a smaller degree of ambiguity than their constituent words, and therefore represent the concepts expressed in text more accurately than single terms. This method extracts key phrases from original results, and calculates the semantic similarity between the query phrase and each phrase extracted using the semantic similarity algorithm based on WordNet, and then expands the query with the most similar phrases to search again. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can provide more precision than the traditional query expansion methods.","","POD:978-0-7695-3151-9","10.1109/ISIP.2008.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4554052","phrase;query expansion;similarity","Chaos;Computer science;Data mining;Indexing;Information processing;Information retrieval;Q measurement;Search engines;Web pages;Web search","Internet;indexing;query processing","Web pages;WordNet;indexing process;information retrieval methods;phrases semantic similarity;query expansion algorithm;query phrase","","7","","16","","","23-25 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is an enabling technology for content-based video annotation, query and retrieval with applications in Internet video search and video data mining. The method involves identifying objects in the scene, describing their inter-relations, detecting events of interest, and representing them semantically in a human readable and query-able format. The SAVE framework is composed of three main components. The first component is an image parsing engine that performs scene content extraction using bottom-up image analysis and a stochastic attribute image grammar, where we define a visual vocabulary from pixels, primitives, parts, objects and scenes, and specify their spatio-temporal or compositional relations; and a bottom-up top-down strategy is used for inference. The second component is an event inference engine, where the video event markup language (VEML) is adopted for semantic representation, and a grammar-based approach is used for event analysis and detection. The third component is the text generation engine that generates text report using head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG). The main contribution of this paper is a framework for an end-to-end system that infers visual events and annotates a large collection of videos.

The efficient retrieval in natural images has been proven a difficult task for content-based image retrieval systems. In this paper, we present a system that adapts two different index structures, namely Slim-Tree and BitMatrix, for efficient retrieval of images based on multidimensional low-level features such as color, texture and shape. These index structures also use metric space. We use MPEG-7 Descriptors extracted from images to represent these features and store them in a native XML database.

Sunderland also developed a search engine designed to match text queries derived from the test data against concept descriptors derived from the training data using the TF.IDF measure. The search engine-based approach outperformed SVM-light, but did not perform overall as well as the MediaMill baseline for text feature extraction. However, the search-engine approach is much simpler than the supervised learning approach of MediaMill, and did outperform the MediaMill baseline for 31 of the 101 concept categories.","1949-3983;19493983","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2044-5; POD:978-1-4244-2043-8","10.1109/CBMI.2008.4564972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564972","","Broadcasting;Feature extraction;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia communication;Multimedia systems;Search engines;Testing;Text analysis;Training data","feature extraction;search engines;support vector machines","mediamill baselines;search engine;support vector machine;text feature extraction;text feature vectors;video shot annotations","","0","","19","","","18-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A hidden Markov model (HMM)-based matching strategy is employed to compare the transformed signatures. The proposed protected authentication system generates a score as the result of the matching process, thus allowing to implement protected multibiometric recognition systems, through the application of score-fusion techniques. The experimental results show that, at the cost of only a slight performance reduction, the desired protection for the employed biometric templates can be properly achieved.","2160-7508;21607508","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2340-8; POD:978-1-4244-2339-2","10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4563114","","Authentication;Bioinformatics;Biomedical signal processing;Biometrics;Costs;Data security;Hidden Markov models;Information retrieval;Protection;Signal generators","handwriting recognition;hidden Markov models;message authentication;pattern matching","biometric data security;biometric-based recognition system;hidden Markov model-based matching;online signature authentication;score-fusion technique;signal processing techniques;signature-based biometric authentication system;template protection","","18","","20","","","23-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To compute the similitude measure we consider the external contour of the silhouettes, we extract their convexities and concavities at different scale levels and we build a multiscale representation.

Although XML data is self-describing, most application domains tend to use document schemas, given as Document Type Definitions (DTDs) or XML-Schemas. An XML document is considered valid if it conforms to the constraints and rules specified in its schema. A lot of work has been done in querying XML documents. Recently, the issue of updating XML documents has gained attention because an update operation may invalidate the whole document. In this paper, we present existing approaches to update XML documents and offer a new one that guarantees that the updated document still conforms to its DTD. Our methodology updates XML documents without breaking their validity by storing and retrieving XML documents in/from an object database.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3163-2","10.1109/ICIW.2008.99","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545638","","Data models;Database languages;Doped fiber amplifiers;Information retrieval;Object oriented databases;Object oriented modeling;Prototypes;Relational databases;Web and internet services;XML","XML;data structures;object-oriented databases;query processing","XML document updating;data exchange;data representation;document type definitions;object database","","1","","13","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the MPEG-7 is conceived as a set of services for extracting and storing visual descriptors. The MPEg-7 text-annotation tool is used for semantic descriptions. Semantic descriptions are linked to images content and conceived as a service for annotating and storing.

Both, guidance and freedom are needed in order to enable him (or her) to accomplish his search goal as quickly and efficiently as possible. The search goal can be both, to retrieve a target image (lookup search) or to get an overview of a collection as the basis for accomplishing complex search tasks (exploratory search). VisualFlamenco is about bringing content-based image retrieval and faceted search together. While there is some preexisting work towards faceted search based on automatically extracted metadata, the base innovation of our work is to visualize the meaning of facets and let the user pick visualized facets directly. The main point is this research is to give the user the right expectations about what the system can achieve. We see this as a step towards dependable multimedia search, search interfaces that do not promise more than they can achieve. A mismatch of expectations and possibilities has been denoted by some as one of the main problems in current research about multimedia search.
