How to prevent the templates from being abused, and how to protect the users' privacy well are important problems. This paper proposes an approach based on knowledge signatures to solve these problems, which provides a cancelable template. Only a non-invertible transformed version of the biometrics is stored in the server, and the original data can't be obtained, so the users' privacy can be protected well. Moreover, distinguished with other cancelable templates, it only needs an incompact association between the key and the biometrics feature, even if the key is disclosed, the original biometrics feature wouldn't be revealed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is practical.","","POD:978-0-7695-3258-5","10.1109/ISECS.2008.100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606098","","Authentication;Biometrics;Cryptography;Fingerprint recognition;Information retrieval;Information security;Privacy;Proposals;Protection;Spectrogram","biometrics (access control);speech processing","biometric-based authentication;cancelable voiceprint templates;knowledge signatures;noninvertible transformed version;safety guarantee;template security;user identity","","9","","12","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Results from various experimental research should be utilized to improve existing approaches underlying tagging data and contribute further to weaving the Web. However, in practice, there are not enough solutions taking advantage of these results. Even though we can mine social relations via tagging data, it proves no worth for users if this data cannot be reused.In this paper we propose a solution for tag data representation which allows data reuse across different tagging systems.

YCbCr is intended to take advantage of human colour-response characteristics. Results show that our algorithm outperforms both F5 and S-Tools. Moreover, our system demonstrates improved performance in retrieving the hidden data after applying image processing attacks in the form of additive artificial noise. As a performance measurement for image distortion Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which is classified under the difference distortion metrics, can be applied to the Stego images.

Information retrieved from such a system can be used in the domain of daily life surveillance. We demonstrate that eating or drinking actions can be featured and detected using wearable inertial sensors only. The proposed approach has two steps: feature extraction and classification. The arm movement is the main features of the eating activity. Thus the first step is to extract features from the arm movement raw data. The movement kinematics model for feature extraction in 3D space is firstly built up based on Eular angles. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to extract the features from the eating action information in a three dimensional space in real time. The second step is the classification. The hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) network is adopted to classify the extracted features of the eating action based on the space and time varying property of the features. The advantages for the HTM algorithm used for classification is that it not only can classify the statistic actions but also can deal with the dynamic signals which is varying with both of the space and time. The HTM can perform high accuracy for the dynamic action detection. The proposed approach is tested through the real eating and drinking action by using the 3-D accelerometer. The experimental results show that the HTM and EKF based method can perform the action recognition with very high accuracy.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2281-4; POD:978-1-4244-2280-7","10.1109/HEALTH.2008.4600131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600131","","Classification algorithms;Computer vision;Data mining;Feature extraction;Humans;Information retrieval;Kinematics;Statistics;Surveillance;Wearable sensors","Kalman filters;accelerometers;feature extraction;gesture recognition;medical diagnostic computing;nonlinear filters;sensors;statistical analysis;surveillance","3D accelerometer;3D space;Eular angles;activities detection;arm gesture detection;chronic disease diagnosis;daily life surveillance;drinking actions;eating actions;extended Kalman filter;feature classification;feature extraction;hierarchical temporal memory network;mobile cardiac monitor;movement kinematics model;statistic actions;two-stage action recognition approach;wearable inertial sensors;wireless health monitoring product","","7","1","9","","","7-9 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the approach presented here features extracted from an audio file are used to map a song onto a psychologically based emotion space. The motivation behind this system is the lack of intuitive and contextually aware playlist generation tools available to music listeners. The need for such tools is made obvious by the fact that digital music libraries are constantly expanding, thus making it increasingly difficult to recall a particular song in the library or to create a playlist for a specific event. In this paper, we compared the performance of the proposed W-D-KNN classification method with that of other popular classifiers by applying them to a music database consisting of 60 famous popular songs from English albums. Each song annotated by 40 participants. The emotions of these songs distribute roughly uniformly in each quadrant of the emotion plane. The experimental results show that the proposed W-D-KNN classifier achieves a recognition rate of more than 96% and outperforms KNN and SVM classifiers.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3161-8","10.1109/ICICIC.2008.679","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603719","","Context awareness;Data mining;Databases;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Mood;Music information retrieval;Psychology;Software libraries;Support vector machines","emotion recognition;information retrieval;music;pattern classification","digital music libraries;mood classification;music emotion recognition;music information retrieval;weighted D-KNN classification","","0","","13","","","18-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel method is proposed to construct the inter-graph relationship of images by introducing virtual links and setting the link weights to one.

In addition, they may not be able to retrieve statistics data from departed peers in dynamic peer-to-peer systems. In this paper, we solve this dilemma through an indirect collection mechanism that distributes data using random network coding across the network, from which servers proactively pull such statistics. By buffering data in a decentralized fashion with only a small portion of peer resources, we show that our new mechanism provides a ""buffering"" zone and a ""smoothing"" factor to collect large volumes of statistics, with appropriate resilience to peer dynamics and scalability to a large peer population.","1063-6927;10636927","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3172-4","10.1109/ICDCS.2008.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4595869","","Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Network coding;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Resilience;Scalability;Smoothing methods;Statistical distributions;Statistics","peer-to-peer computing;statistical analysis","centralized logging servers;indirect large-scale P2P data collection;large-scale peer-to-peer applications;random network coding;server bottlenecks","","5","","15","","","17-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider the case of textures. This approach considers invariance at the query level rather than at the representation level. We use two models to capture the textural visual content of images: the autoregressive (AR) model and a perceptual (PCP) model based on a set of perceptual features. The perceptual model is used with two viewpoints: the original images viewpoint and the autocovariance function viewpoint. These representation models are not invariant with respect to geometric and photometric transformations. Then, by using results fusion of multiple representations and/or multiple queries, we show that retrieval effectiveness is improved in an important way even though the representation models are not invariant. The resulting invariant texture retrieval algorithm has two levels of results fusion (merging): 1. The first level consists in merging results returned by the different models / viewpoints (representations) for the same query in one results list using appropriate fusion models; 2. The second level consists in merging each fused list of results of different queries into a unique fused list using appropriate fusion models.

The DCB approach relies on a set of terms for parsing and segmenting input texts. Whereas the MLB approach relies on a model trained from a corpus by using machine learning techniques. We compare between two algorithms from the DCB approach: longest-matching and maximal matching, and four algorithms from the MLB approach: Naive Bayes (NB), decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), and conditional random field (CRF). From the experimental results, the DCB approach yielded better performance than the NB, decision tree and SVM algorithms from the MLB approach. However, the best performance was obtained from the CRF algorithm with the precision and recall of 95.79% and 94.98%, respectively.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2102-2; POD:978-1-4244-2101-5","10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600388","Word segmentation;dictionary-based;machine learning algorithms;morphological analysis;tokenization","Decision trees;Dictionaries;Information management;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Natural languages;Niobium;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;support vector machines","Thai word segmentation;conditional random field;decision tree;dictionary based word segmentation;longest-matching algorithms;machine learning based word segmentation;maximal matching;naive Bayes;support vector machine","","19","","17","","","14-17 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given a query motion sequence, our goal is to search for all the similar motions from a database. Specifically, a feature vector based on the distribution of the human motion data is first extracted from each motion sequence in the database. Then, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector. To improve the retrieval efficiency, a two-level indexing scheme based on the HSOM is constructed, in which the motion sequences are first partitioned with the reduced feature vectors at the top level and then at the lower level, the original feature vectors are adopted to classify the cluster associated with a parent node at the first level into sub-clusters. Finally, fuzzy search is implemented to traverse the index structure to search for similar motions.

A attribute reduction algorithm based on rough set theory is given in this paper to reduce the text feature term and extract rule. First, the weight of feature term is made discrete. Then, the decision table is made with weight as the condition attributes and classes of texts as the decision attributes. Finally, the classification rules are extracted by attribute reduction. The method is simple and feasible. It is advantageous in improving the efficiency of the selected feature subset and suitable for high-volume text classification.

Specifically, the model under consideration assumes that the encoder is provided with full channel state information (CSI) in a noncausal manner, and the decoder is provided with partial state knowledge, quantified by a rate limit. Coding of side information intended for the channel decoder is a Wyner-Ziv like problem, since the channel output depends statistically on the state, thus serving as side information in retrieving the encoded state. Therefore, coding for such a channel involves the simultaneous solution of a Wyner-Ziv problem and a related Gel'fand-Pinsker problem. A single-letter characterization of the capacity of this channel is developed, that involves two rate constraints, in the form of Wyner-Ziv and Gel'fand-Pinsker formulas. Applications are suggested to watermarking problems, where a compressed version of the host signal is present at the decoder. Two main models are examined: the standard watermarking problem, where the decoder is interested only in the embedded information, and the reversible information embedding problem, where the decoder is interested also in exact reproduction of the host. For both problems, single-letter characterizations of the region of all achievable rate-distortion triples (R, R<sub>d</sub>, D) are given, where R is the embedding rate, R<sub>d</sub> is the rate limit of the compressed host at the decoder, and D is the average distortion between the host and the composite data set (stegotext). For reversible information embedding, two stages of attack are considered, modeled by a degraded broadcast channel, where the weaker (degraded) channel represents the second attack, and both decoders are required to fully reproduce the host.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2008.928295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4608994","Degraded broadcast channels;information embedding;noncausal coding;partial side information;reversible information embedding;side information;watermarking","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Channel capacity;Channel state information;Decoding;Degradation;Information retrieval;Information theory;Resource management;Watermarking","broadcast channels;channel coding;decoding;information retrieval;watermarking","Wyner-Ziv problem;channel capacity;channel coding;channel state information;partial state information;partial state knowledge;rate-distortion triples;rate-limited side information;watermarking problem","","15","","23","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Detection sensitivity is measured by the ratio of the contrast to tissue intensity (CTR) and is limited by the fact, that the tissue response is also weakly nonlinear.

The goal is to store and query the positions of these objects. Index structures were proposed to achieve this goal. While index structures are designed mainly for unconstrained movement, databases in transportation networks are characterized by not only the speed to retrieve the spatial location of a moving object but also by their constrained movement. Moreover, in a constrained space, traditional indexing methods usually experience longer time in retrieving spatial location of a moving object. Therefore dynamic index structure is needed to efficiently locate moving objects. This paper proposes an efficient and dynamic index structure called transportation network R<sup>+</sup>-Tree (TNR<sup>+</sup>-Tree). The proposed structure meets the above requirements and gives algorithms for searching and updating the structure. Analytical results show that TNR<sup>+</sup>-Tree achieves up to 50% savings in disk accesses when searching files of thousands of rectangles.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2320-0; POD:978-1-4244-2319-4","10.1109/IFOST.2008.4602917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4602917","","Application software;Classification tree analysis;Computer science;Data models;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Spatial databases;Transportation","database indexing;visual databases","database applications;dynamic index structure;moving objects indexing;spatial objects;transportation networks;unconstrained movement","","4","","10","","","23-29 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, their index schemes are short of optimizing data arrangement in the external structures. Improper handles adopted in the traditional splitting policies including pre-partition of data underlying space, node splitting by force, node splitting with unbalanced partition, and node splitting upon overflowed loading usually burden index structures with plenty of inefficient storage space and exceeding construction overhead. Consequentially, time and space efficiencies in conventional B<sup>+</sup>-tree and its variants remain much room for improvement. In this paper, a new index scheme is proposed to organize data into a more compactness via a better splitting policy. The new index scheme constantly compresses data in the external structure of an index tree and makes neighboring data more aggregative than traditional methods. The compact B<sup>+</sup>-trees elevate space utilization to a higher level which is near 90%.

Since the way that people convey thoughts at the abstract concept level makes little, if any, difference in the languages they use, it is possible to measure semantic similarity between different lingual documents based on the concepts conveyed by the documents. In this paper, a novel fuzzy rough set based method for measurement of semantic similarity between cross lingual (Chinese and English) documents is proposed. Aided by a bilingual dictionary and Wordnet, translation is processed like word sense disambiguation and all the distilled senses are used to construct a fuzzy approximation space using a fuzzy partition algorithm. In the fuzzy approximation space documents are approximated by their fuzzy upper and lower approximations and the similarity measure is defined accordingly. The upper and lower approximations correspond to the slack and tight extent of the concepts in their associated document. This method makes possible to distinguish among the documents whose original texts seem not similar but conveyed concepts are similar.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3161-8","10.1109/ICICIC.2008.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603271","","Approximation algorithms;Computer science;Dictionaries;Extraterrestrial measurements;Fuzzy sets;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Natural languages;Partitioning algorithms;Solid modeling","fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;natural language processing;rough set theory","Wordnet;bilingual dictionary;cross-lingual document similarity;cross-lingual information retrieval;fuzzy approximation space documents;fuzzy partition algorithm;fuzzy-rough set;semantic similarity","","1","","10","","","18-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed protocol is aimed at applications where all sensor nodes need to provide their current data concurrently and periodically back to the sink, whist having an option to provide instantaneous individual node data upon sensing. Hence, the scheme provides a hybrid time-driven and an event-driven mechanism. The scheme initially establishes the hopcount of sensor nodes from the sink and identifies the highest hopcount nodes (HHN) of the sensor network. An application scenario is the periodical recovery of the global extremity value back to the sink by only using the HHNs for initiating the broadcast, which inherently traverses all sensor nodes due to the nature and position of such nodes. This approach can hence effectively retrieve sensor data from all nodes concurrently in its target application. Furthermore, the scheme provides a platform for other data-centric protocols to efficiently and concurrently disseminate data from all nodes in the network.","2376-6492;23766492","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2202-9; POD:978-1-4244-2201-2","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600029","","Biosensors;Broadcasting;Energy efficiency;Extremities;Feedback;Information retrieval;Information science;Routing protocols;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;wireless sensor networks","data-centric protocols;event-driven mechanism;highest hopcount nodes;hybrid time-driven mechanism;self-organizing concurrent global information dissemination;wireless sensor networks","","0","","14","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The previous techniques on spatio-temporal indexing miss the semantics of the application since they are usually based on traditional indexing structures that has little to no semantic information incorporated. In those systems, the semantic queries were executed by using the low-level index structures. In this paper, we introduce a novel indexing method for spatiotemporal data: semantic sequence state graph (S<sup>3</sup>G). S<sup>3</sup>G maintains the properties of events-objects locations for efficient spatio-temporal queries. In S<sup>3</sup>G, the spatial information is maintained in states whereas semantic events that result in temporal ordering link the states. S<sup>3</sup>G supports our SMART(semantic modeling and retrieval) system.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3279-0","10.1109/ICSC.2008.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597175","","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer science;Fuzzy systems;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Spatial databases;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Videoconference","graph theory;indexing;video databases","semantic modeling;semantic retrieval;semantic sequence state graph;spatio-temporal data indexing;tennis video database","","2","","13","","","4-7 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a system for personal image retrieval on the WWW is proposed. Particularly, a powerful text-based search engine (for instance, Google and Baidu, etc.) is first borrowed to start the initial retrieval with a given personal name. Then, the visual confidence with respect to somebody to be searched is explored (facial visual information in this case). By the analysis of the retrieved Web pages, the text-based semantic information is also extracted. With the fusion of visual confidence and textual information, the well known semantic gap can be narrowed down to some extent. The experiment results show that the proposed system achieved much better performance than the initial Web image retrieval via search engine used popularly.","","POD:978-0-7695-3278-3","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2008.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4604171","Content based image retrieval;Face detection;Web analysis;feature fusion","Data mining;HTML;Image retrieval;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Web pages;Web search;World Wide Web","Web sites;image retrieval;search engines;semantic Web","WWW;Web pages;Web personal image retrieval;Web search engines;text-based search engine;text-based semantic information","","1","","10","","","15-17 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our contribution is two fold: first, we present an extension to the UDDI inquiry capabilities. This enables a private UDDI registry owner to customize or rank the query results, based on its business requirements. Second, our proposal utilizes existing technologies and standards which require minimal changes to existing UDDI interfaces or its data structures.

Thus, a single snapshot of multistatic data acquisition provides richer information than its classical MUSIC counterpart. In this paper we augment the original (point target based) formulation of the FRM method so as to make it applicable to extended targets of moderate size. First we show that the same pseudo-distribution used in H. Lev-Ari and A.J. Devaney (2000) and R. Zandifar (2001) to locate point targets can still be used to obtain a reliable estimate of the location of the extended target.

However, since sensors are not placed under the control of one specific entity, it is difficult to retrieve appropriate information from the distributed sensors. In addition, when the same queries are sent by different users, same processes for collecting sensing data are repeated. The repetitive processing causes a load increase of sensors and network. In this paper, we propose a P2P-based architecture for managing distributed sensor information, which treats sensing data based on those semantic. The proposed architecture is constructed of three layers, 'raw layer', 'abstract layer' and 'logical layer', which enables to generate necessary information from retrieved data semantically. In addition, we propose a method to create virtual sensors by real peer. The virtual sensor manages processed data as a cache of real sensing data. We implemented the proposed architecture and method on PIAX, which is a development platform for agent-based P2P system. Then we evaluated the proposed virtual sensor placement method by simulations. By the simulation results, we confirmed that proposed method achieve a context-aware application with reducing the amount of network traffic.","","POD:978-0-7695-3297-4","10.1109/SAINT.2008.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4604609","P2P;deduction;distributed processing;semantic web;sensing data","Computer architecture;Content management;Data analysis;Information analysis;Information management;Information retrieval;Information science;Internet;Milling machines;Ubiquitous computing","distributed sensors;peer-to-peer computing;sensor fusion;telecommunication traffic;ubiquitous computing;virtual instrumentation","P2P-based context-aware application;abstract layer;distributed sensor information;distributed sensor information management architecture;information retrieval;logical layer;network traffic;raw layer;semantic analysis;sensing data;ubiquitous computing environment;virtual sensors","","6","","8","","","July 28 2008-Aug. 1 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, most Web sites organize their data systematically and relevant data may be separated into different pages but linked through hyperlinks. However, the existing Web search engines cannot integrate information from multiple interrelated pages to answer keyword queries meaningfully. Next-generation web search engines require link-awareness, or more generally, the capability of integrating correlative information items that are linked through hyperlinks. In this paper, we study the problems of identifying the ""information unit"" of relevant pages containing all the input keywords as the answer. We model a set of most related Web pages as a tree, where the nodes in the tree are the web pages and the edges are the links between the Web pages. We retrieve the ""information unit"" of the most related and connected subtrees instead of single Web page as the answer. To improve the search efficiency, we propose an effective LCA-based algorithm to identify those subtrees which are most related to the given input keywords. We have conducted a set of extensive experiments on the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that our method achieves high search performance and outperforms the existing alternative methods significantly.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3185-4","10.1109/WAIM.2008.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4596991","Information Unit;Keyword Search;LCA","Conference management;Information retrieval;Internet;Keyword search;Relational databases;Search engines;Tree data structures;Unsolicited electronic mail;Web pages;Web search","Web sites;search engines","Internet technology;LCA-based keyword search;Web pages;Web search engines;Web sites;data structures;information unit;information unit retrieval;subtrees","","0","","14","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An optimal acceptance threshold is chosen to maximize the probability of accepting more positives and rejecting more negatives at the first stage so that an optimal number of candidates are selected. The first classifier is trained using simple color and texture features. The second classifier is trained by scale invariant feature transform (SIFT). For a query image, a number of matching candidates are selected using k nearest neighbor at the first stage and passed on to the second stage for a refining classification to select the best matching result. The searching range is narrowed down dynamically at the second stage depending on the output of the first stage. Experimental results show that this method is promising by improving the recognition accuracy and reducing the computation time.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-2570-9","10.1109/ICME.2008.4607729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4607729","Cascaded classification;Scale Invariant Feature Transform;nearest neighbor match;place recognition;scene recognition","Bridges;Buildings;Cameras;Feature extraction;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Nearest neighbor searches;Transportation","combinatorial mathematics;feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image matching;transforms","cascaded classification;color feature;image matching;k nearest neighbor;optimal candidate selection;place recognition;scale invariant feature transform;texture feature","","2","","6","","","June 23 2008-April 26 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Information marketplaces can be considered as places where users search and retrieve information goods. Such places appear to be very interesting information retrieval models. Furthermore, software agent technology could help users and providers to work in such open environments providing a variety of advantages. Users as well as information providers could be represented by intelligent agents that work autonomously. The representatives of users assume the role of information buyers while the representatives of information sources could be referred to as sellers. In this paper, we examine a scenario where agents representing entities involved in an information marketplace bargain over the prices of information goods. Bargaining originates in game theory (GT). The rationale is that some entities contest to gain as much profit as possible in an open environment. We study the sellerspsila side. Sellers involved in a number of games with buyers, are trying to achieve as greater prices as possible in order to gain more profit from each game. We present a theoretical model of deadline computation for which sellers are participating in the game. Over this time limit it is useless for sellers to continue the game while buyers reject the proposed prices.","","POD:978-0-7695-3109-0","10.1109/CISIS.2008.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606680","Agents;Information Marketplaces;bargaining game","Competitive intelligence;Computational modeling;Game theory;Hardware;Humans;Informatics;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Software agents;Software systems","electronic commerce;game theory;information retrieval;pricing;software agents","Web business models;deadline calculation;game theory;information buyers;information goods trading;information marketplaces;information providers;information retrieval;intelligent agents;seller agent bargaining;software agent technology","","9","","15","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An approach called spatial frequent items is proposed as an extension of Bag-of-Words method by introducing spatial relations between patches. Spatial frequent items are defined as frequent pairs of adjacent local image patches in polar coordinates, and exploited using data mining. Based on these frequent configurations, we develop a method to encode patches and their spatial relations for image indexing and retrieval. Besides, to avoid the interference of background patches, informative patches are filtrated based on their local entropy and self-similarity in the preprocess stage. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be 8.6% more effective than the state-of-art object retrieval methods.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-2570-9","10.1109/ICME.2008.4607682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4607682","Informative patches;Object retrieval;Spatial frequent items","Computers;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information processing;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Object detection;Vocabulary","data mining;database indexing;entropy codes;filtering theory;image coding;image retrieval;object detection;visual databases","Bag-of-Words method;data mining;filtering theory;image coding;image indexing;image retrieval;local entropy;local image patch;object retrieval;spatial frequent item;spatial relation","","2","","10","","","June 23 2008-April 26 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are some ways to represent images such as 2D string. 2D string is a tool which represents spatial relationships among objects in symbolic image databases. 2D strings with respect to 3D hash functions are used in this paper to present a fast method for partial or total image retrieval. In the proposed method, a new data structure based on multi level linked lists is proposed to reduce algorithm time complexity. The proposed method overcame the constraint of other methods in image rotation. Because this method does not need to reconstruct data structures at new insertion, it can be extended toward dynamic databases. Simulation results showed the performance of our method. We concluded based on experimental results that our method time complexity tends to O(1).","2157-8672;21578672","CD-ROM:978-80-227-2880-5; POD:978-80-227-2856-0","10.1109/IWSSIP.2008.4604429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4604429","2D string;3D hash function;Image indexing;total image retrieval","Analytical models;Data engineering;Data structures;Image databases;Image reconstruction;Image representation;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems","computational complexity;data structures;database indexing;visual databases","2D string;3D hash functions;data structure;fast indexing;image indexing;image rotation;multilevel linked lists;retrieval method;symbolic image databases;time complexity","","2","","11","","","25-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the main challenging issues is how to extract meaningful information from the huge and complex lifelog data which is continuously captured and accumulated from multiple sensors. This study is focused on the activity models and analysis techniques to process lifelog data in order: to find what events/states are interesting or important, to summarize the useful records in some structured and semantic ways for efficient retrievals and presentations of past life experiences, and to use these experiences to further improve the individualpsilas quality of life. We propose an integrated technique to process the lifelog data using the correlations between different kinds of captured data from multiple sensors, instead of dealing with them separately. To use and test the proposed models and the analysis techniques, several prototype systems have been implemented and applied to some domain-specific lifelog data; such as in improving a grouppsilas collaborative efforts in revising a software, in managing kidpsilas outdoor safety care, in providing a runnerpsilas workout assistance, and in structuring lifelog image generation, respectively.","","POD:978-0-7695-3287-5","10.1109/ICESS.2008.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4595603","","Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Data mining;Image analysis;Information retrieval;Life testing;Software prototyping;Software safety;Software testing;System testing","image fusion;image retrieval","daily activity analysis;information extraction;lifelog image;wearable multiple sensor","","4","","24","","","29-31 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The query images of interest in this paper are specified rectangular-shaped and circular-shaped as framed photographs. By incorporating the advantages of adaptive thresholding and tolerant partitioning into peak color regions, the proposed method requires low computational complexity and it is very feasible for image detection and segmentation. Peak image regions are then extracted by using color histograms. Since the number of the peak regions is much smaller than that of the image pixels, this proposed method allows a low dimensional image processing. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through experiments with various images.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3161-8","10.1109/ICICIC.2008.478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603241","","Adaptive systems;Data mining;Histograms;Image processing;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Pixel;Robustness;Shape","computational complexity;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;image segmentation","color histogram;computational complexity;image detection;image pixel;image retrieval;image segmentation;query images","","0","","10","","","18-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper highlights the need for contextual and environmental information, which ultimately defines the listenerpsilas listening scenario. Here, the preliminary results of an online music survey are analysed. These results indicate the possibility of how environmental features may be used as metadata to indicate the listenerpsilas mood. Therefore, environmental features, such as location, activity, temperature, lighting and weather have great potential as metadata and hence may be used to create a personalised automatic playlist generator for large music collections.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-2570-9","10.1109/ICME.2008.4607603","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4607603","Automatic Playlist Generation;Environmental Metadata;Large Music Collections;Mood Detection;Music Retrieval","Appropriate technology;Codecs;Collaboration;Digital audio players;Filtering;Mood;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Space technology;Temperature","audio databases;information retrieval;meta data;music;very large databases","contextual information;environmental information;environmental metadata;large music collections;online music survey;personalised automatic playlist generator","","5","","12","","","June 23 2008-April 26 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
