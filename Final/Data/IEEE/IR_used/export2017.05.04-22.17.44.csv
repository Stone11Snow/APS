It refers that a set of data items is orderly broadcast at multiple parallel channels and the client that requires multiple data items retrieves these parallel channels (find an optimal data retrieval sequence) to download their required information at a minimized access latency. Currently, although many schemes have been proposed to study on data retrieval problem with single request which includes multiple data items, the most efficient scheme with lower time complexity is not found. In this paper, we define data retrieval problem with multiple requests denoted as DRMR problem. Our algorithm adopts a novelty scheme to convert a wireless data broadcast system into a DAG, and applies topological sorting to address the DRMR problem. We have validated the performance of our proposed algorithm, and show that the proposed algorithm can obtain the best performance among all existing algorithms as far as we know.","1945-7871;19457871","Electronic:978-1-4799-4717-1; POD:978-1-4799-4716-4","10.1109/ICMEW.2014.6890686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890686","Data broadcast;Data retrieval;Data schedule;Indexing;Mobile computing","Algorithm design and analysis;Indexing;Schedules;Servers;Sorting;Wireless communication","computational complexity;information retrieval;mobile computing","DAG;DRMR problem;data retrieval problem;efficient data retrieval algorithm;minimized access latency;multiitem request;multiple data items;multiple parallel channels;public information dissemination;time complexity;wireless broadcast environments;wireless data broadcast","","1","","10","","","14-18 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These schemes do not qualify as a secure and scalable solution for the multiparty setting, where users outsource their encrypted data to a cloud server and selectively authorize each other to search. Due to the possibility that the cloud server may collude with some malicious users, it is a challenge to have a secure and scalable multiparty searchable encryption (MPSE) scheme. This is shown by our analysis on the Popa-Zeldovich scheme, which says that an honest user may leak all her search patterns even if she shares only one of her documents with another malicious user. Based on our analysis, we present a new security model for MPSE by considering the worst case and average-case scenarios, which capture different server-user collusion possibilities. We then propose a MPSE scheme by employing the bilinear property of Type-3 pairings and prove its security based on the bilinear Diffie-Hellman variant and symmetric external Diffie-Hellman assumptions in the random oracle model.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2359389","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905822","Multi-party searchable encryption (MPSE);data privacy;pairing;trapdoor privacy","Authorization;Data privacy;Encryption;Indexes;Servers","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;information retrieval;network servers","MPSE scheme;Popa-Zeldovich scheme;Type-3 pairings;average-case scenarios;bilinear Diffie-Hellman variant;bilinear property;cloud server;encrypted data searching;malicious users;multiparty setting;random oracle model;scalable multiparty searchable encryption scheme;search patterns;server-user collusion possibilities;shared data searching;symmetric external Diffie-Hellman assumptions;symmetric searchable encryption schemes","","4","","28","","20140919","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They carry a metaphorical sense that makes their comprehension difficult as their meaning cannot be deduced from the meaning of their constituent parts. They pose a challenge for Natural language processing (NLP) applications like machine translation, information retrieval and question answering as their translation and meaning needs to be derived logically rather than literally. A lot of research work has been carried out into automatic extraction of multi-word expressions, but no comprehensive work has been reported on idioms in Hindi. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the linguistic and morphological variations that are usually encountered in idioms in Hindi. Based on this study, a methodology for deriving rules for representation of idioms and their search has been developed. The rules representing the idioms are hand crafted. For the idiom identification, rule-base has been used to mark the input text for probable presence of idiom. Our system is limited to use only intra-sentential context. The experimental results demonstrate feasibility and scalability of our methodology.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-5171-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-5173-4; POD:978-1-4799-5174-1","10.1109/IC3.2014.6897218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6897218","Hindi;NLP;idiom variations;idioms","Arrays;Context;Data mining;Databases;Natural language processing;Semantics;Syntactics","language translation;natural language processing;question answering (information retrieval)","Hindi;NLP;idiom identification;information retrieval;machine translation;metaphorical sense;multiword expressions;natural language processing;question answering","","0","","15","","","7-9 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For increasing the accessing the data in grid environment we need to replicate it, at the nearest client, this can be done effectively by using the replication methods. Since user request and need of data is dynamic in nature so we need an approach which can address this problem and also resolve them and in data grid, large quantity of data file is produced so we need a dynamic replication approach through which we can reduce data access time. In this paper, the replication decision is taken on the basis of access history of data on the multiple sites.

In this paper, we propose schemes to deal with secure ranked multi-keyword search in a multi-owner model. To enable cloud servers to perform secure search without knowing the actual data of both keywords and trapdoors, we systematically construct a novel secure search protocol.

In particular, there is extensive research on the topological properties associated with their structure as this allows the analysis of the overall behaviour of such networks. However, extracting networks from structured and unstructured data sets raises several challenges, including addressing any inconsistency present in the data, as well as the difficulty in investigating their properties especially when the topological structure is not fully determined or not explicitly defined. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address the automated identification, assessment and ranking of the most likely structure associated with networks extracted from a variety of data sets. More specifically, our approach allows to mine data to assess whether their associated networks exhibit properties comparable to well-known structures, namely scale-free, small world and random networks. The main motivation is to provide a toolbox to classify and analyse real-world networks otherwise difficult to fully assess due to their potential lack of structure. This can be used to investigate their dynamical and statistical behaviour which would potentially lead to a better understanding and prediction of the properties of the system (s) they model. Our initial validation shows the potential of our method providing relevant and accurate results.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4326-5; Electronic:978-1-4799-4325-8; POD:978-1-4799-1677-1","10.1109/CISIS.2014.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915536","Data analytics;Information extraction;Knowledge discovery;Networks;Social graphs","Approximation methods;Data mining;Data models;Feature extraction;Mathematical model;Sentiment analysis;Standards","data analysis;data mining;information retrieval;small-world networks;statistical analysis;topology","assessment;automated identification;data analytics;data mining;dynamical behaviour;information extraction;network behaviour analysis;network structures;random networks;ranking;real-world networks;scale-free networks;small world networks;statistical behaviour;system properties;topological properties;topological structure;unstructured data sets","","7","","11","","","2-4 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, energy management systems typically provide users with specialised tools and reports to facilitate the ongoing energy management process. However, an energy management system that does not consider energy related data does not provide a comprehensive cross-industry solution. A system that is capable of comparing energy data with related data such as production, budget and cost data presents further opportunities for comprehensive energy management. The logistics of data retrieval and management from a wide variety of data sources is, however, problematic because of diverse data formats and modes of access. These data sources range from databases to document based reports and accounts. Energy personnel on different authority levels require access to different data to fulfil their specific role in the energy management process. Furthermore, individual energy personnel have their own preferences regarding the type and graphical representation of data. Therefore, this paper presents a generic approach to integrating data required for comprehensive energy management. The results obtained from practical implementations also proved the approach's adherence to the requirements of different industries. These initial implementations only included electrical energy and related data, while future implementations will include data for other energy sources.","2166-0581;21660581","Electronic:978-0-9922-0417-4; POD:978-1-4799-6087-3","10.1109/ICUE.2014.6904179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6904179","","Data mining;Databases;Electricity;Energy management;Personnel;Production;SCADA systems","data handling;energy management systems;information retrieval;power engineering computing","data management;data retrieval;data sources;energy management systems;energy personnel;energy related data integration","","0","","8","","","19-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new dataset is characterized by the great diversity of real-life listening contexts where people and music interact. It contains blog articles from the social blogging website LiveJournal, along with tags self-reporting a user's emotional state while posting and the musical track that the user considered as the best match for the post. More importantly, the data are contributed by users spontaneously in their daily lives, instead of being collected in a controlled environment. Therefore, it offers new opportunities to understand the interrelationship among the personal, situational, and musical factors of music listening. As an example application, we present research investigating the interaction between the affective context of the listener and the affective content of music, using audio-based music emotion recognition techniques and a psycholinguistic tool.

However, while cloud databases are highly useful for fast retrieval of basic information, which often exists in tabled or columned formats, challenges exist in utilizing them for data sharing between intelligence analysts who rely upon large amounts of HUMINT data sources for their analytics. In such cases, complex entities and relations (often captured in ontologies) are of interest to the user. Semantic technologies can capture complex entities and relations, but historically have not scaled well. Combining cloud architectures with semantic technologies has shown promise for providing complex data analytics at scale. However problems still exist for intelligence analysts who must operate at the tactical edge, in disconnected environments, with limited cloud access. This paper describes a system developed by Modus Operandi called STRIDE (Semantically-enabled Technology for Reconnaissance and Intelligence in Disconnected Environments) which extracts mission-specific information from the cloud to provide analysts with portable analytics in the form of a semantic wiki that can gather and store information while disconnected and integrate that data back into the cloud by providing entity association and disambiguation upon mission completion.","","Electronic:978-8-4901-2355-3; POD:978-1-4799-1634-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916219","Cloud computing;STRIDE;intelligence analyst;ontology;semantics;tactical edge","Cognition;Data models;Databases;Encyclopedias;Ontologies;Semantics","cloud computing;data analysis;information retrieval;military computing;sensor fusion","HUMINT data sources;Modus Operandi;STRIDE;cloud computing architectures;cloud databases;columned format;complex data analytics;data sharing;entity association;industry application;information retrieval;intelligence analysis fusion;intelligence analysts;military application;portable cloud-based semantics;semantic technologies;semantically-enabled technology for reconnaissance and intelligence in disconnected environments;tabled format;tactical edge analyst","","0","","28","","","7-10 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To support multi-keyword search and search result ranking, we propose to build the search index based on term frequency- and the vector space model with cosine similarity measure to achieve higher search result accuracy. To improve the search efficiency, we propose a tree-based index structure and various adaptive methods for multi-dimensional (MD) algorithm so that the practical search efficiency is much better than that of linear search. To further enhance the search privacy, we propose two secure index schemes to meet the stringent privacy requirements under strong threat models, i.e., known ciphertext model and known background model. In addition, we devise a scheme upon the proposed index tree structure to enable authenticity check over the returned search results.

Looking for something valuable from this ocean of information is quite difficult and this is where rank fusion of results from multiple search engines comes into play. User searches the web in order to retrieve the useful document. A simple web search engines have comparatively small coverage as well as other problem that restrict their capacity to return important documents. The use of multiple searching is the solution for the above problem. It is a tool that sends the queries given by the user to multiple search engines and joins the results that are presented before the user. This improves the coverage and helps in recognizing the power and advantage of different search engines. Present search shows the result in an order that may not be according to the preferences of a particular user. It mostly happens that a URL that the user would like to visit is showing at the last and irrelevant URLs show at very first. In our multiple search engines, several search engines are employed and based on the prior order of clicking the URLs, search results are arranged. This is obtained by assigning weights to different search engines. Thus, a user interface has been implemented in order to provide the ranked results from multiple search engines.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5013-8; POD:978-1-4799-7977-6","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918826","Crawler;Query Processor;Ranking Fusion;Scoring Module","Educational institutions;Engines;Google;Merging;Search engines;Search problems;Web pages","Internet;information retrieval;search engines;user interfaces","URL;Web search engines;World Wide Web;information distribution;multiple search engines;ranked results;result rank fusion;user interface;user search","","0","","11","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We define mashability in terms of harmonic and rhythmic similarity and a measure of spectral balance. The principal novelty in our approach centres on the determination of how elements of songs can be made fit together using key transposition and tempo modification, rather than based on their unaltered properties. In this way, the properties of two songs used to model their mashability can be altered with respect to transformations performed to maximize their perceptual compatibility. AutoMashUpper has a user interface to allow users to control the parameterization of the mashability estimation. It allows users to define ranges for key shifts and tempo as well as adding, changing or removing elements from the created mashups. We evaluate AutoMashUpper by its ability to reliably segment music signals into phrase sections, and also via a listening test to examine the relationship between estimated mashability and user enjoyment.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2014.2347135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876193","Audio user interfaces;creative MIR;music remixing;music signal processing","Estimation;Feature extraction;Harmonic analysis;IEEE transactions;Mashups;Multiple signal classification;Spectrogram","information retrieval;music","AutoMashUpper;automatic creation;harmonic similarity;key transposition;mashability estimation;mashability measurement;multisong music Mashups;music collection;perceptual compatibility;phrase sections;rhythmic similarity;tempo modification","","4","","39","","20140812","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specific word can be more efficiently searched by using suitable hash functions on a hash table where the words of the large text file are organized in order. In this paper, we present a new technique of efficient search of a sequence of words in a large text file using the concept of hashing and linked list. For building the hash table, the words are organized in order. The number of occurrences and positions of each word and positions of its next words are added to the record of each word in the hash table. Any word can be searched using a simple hash function and the subsequent word can be located using the position of next word since this information is available with the record of current word making the hash table as a linked list of words. Since the text file is large, there would be redundancy of hash functional values. Therefore, hash function is used only to locate the upper and lower bounds of the first word. Then an algorithm like binary-search method is used to find the word in the table. We provide our methodology of building the hash table and search techniques. Plausible tests are carried out with simple examples to demonstrate how the algorithms work. Time and space complexities are also computed to show the efficiency of the method.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2806-4; POD:978-1-4799-2807-1","10.1109/WSCAR.2014.6916784","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916784","Hash table;Large document;linked lists;string matching;text searching","Indexes;Memory management;Text recognition","file organisation;information retrieval;search problems;string matching;text analysis","binary-search method;hash function;hash table;string matching algorithm;text file","","0","","18","","","18-20 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an ensemble of automatic keyword extraction systems KEA (Keyphrase Extraction Algorithm) and KUSCO (Knowledge Unsupervised Search for instantiating Concepts on lightweight Ontologies) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Unlike KEA and KUSCO which are well-known tools for automatic keyword extraction, CRF needs further preprocessing. Therefore, a tool for handling AKE from the documents using CRF is developed.

The existing mechanisms fail when being applied to the realistic scenario where smartphones dynamically arrive to the system and sensing tasks are submitted at random. It is particularly challenging to design an incentive mechanism for such a mobile crowd sourcing system, given dynamic smartphones, uncertain arrivals of tasks, strategic behaviors, and private information of smartphones. We propose two truthful auction mechanisms for two different cases of mobile crowd sourcing with dynamic smartphones. For the offline case, we design an optimal truthful mechanism with an optimal task allocation algorithm of polynomial-time computation complexity of O (n+γ)<sup>3</sup>, where n is the number of smartphones and γ is the number of sensing tasks. For the online case, we design a near-optimal truthful mechanism with an online task allocation algorithm that achieves a constant competitive ratio of 1:2.

In recent years, research on measuring user similarity for behavior analysis has attracted a lot of attention in applications such as recommendation systems, crowd behavior analysis applications, and numerous data mining tasks. In this paper, our goal is to estimate the similarity between users' travel patterns according to their travel smart card data. The core of our proposal is a novel user similarity measurement, namely, Travel Spatial-Temporal Similarity (TST), which measures the spatial range and temporal similarity between users. Moreover, we also propose a hybrid index structure, which integrates inverted files and cluster-based partitioning, to allow for efficient retrieval of the top-K most similar users. Through experimental evaluation, our proposed approach is shown to deliver scalable performance.","1551-6245;15516245","Electronic:978-1-4799-5705-7; POD:978-1-4799-5706-4","10.1109/MDM.2014.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916929","","Cities and towns;Data mining;Histograms;Indexing;Smart cards;Time-frequency analysis","data mining;information retrieval;smart cards;travel industry","TST;behavior analysis;cluster-based partitioning;crowd behavior analysis;data mining tasks;human daily mobility pattern dynamics;hybrid index structure;recommendation systems;top-k most similar user retrieval;transaction records;travel smart card data;travel spatial-temporal similarity;urban facility management;urban facility planning;urban service management;urban service planning;user mobility pattern information;user public transporting history;user similarity measurement;user travel patterns;valuable knowledge discovery","","3","","32","","","14-18 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study sets out to find a flexible, adaptable, and cost efficient, approach for storing and accessing information from the government portal. We draw these benefits from using the concept of cloud computing. However, cloud computing is not a new concept. The use of popular and readily available technology such as the Mobile phone can aid in leveraging information access through cloud computing. The innovative aspect of this study is the proposal of a solution that is flexible through the concept of runtime software adaptation in Service Orientated Architecture. An increasingly important requirement of software is ensuring that the system can adapt quickly and effectively to changing business and system needs. Several problem specific runtime adaptation techniques have been put forward.

When data is outsourced to the cloud, for data owners, they need to ensure the security of their privacy; for cloud service providers, they need some information of the data to provide high QoS services; and for authorized users, they need to access to the true value of data. The existing privacy-preserving methods can't meet all the needs of the three parties at the same time. To address this issue, we propose a retrievable data perturbation method and use it in the privacy-preserving in data outsourcing in cloud computing. Our scheme comes in four steps. Firstly, an improved random generator is proposed to generate an accurate ""noise"". Next, a perturbation algorithm is introduced to add noise to the original data. By doing this, the privacy information is hidden, but the mean and covariance of data which the service providers may need remain unchanged. Then, a retrieval algorithm is proposed to get the original data back from the perturbed data. Finally, we combine the retrievable perturbation with the access control process to ensure only the authorized users can retrieve the original data. The experiments show that our scheme perturbs date correctly, efficiently, and securely.","1673-5447;16735447","","10.1109/CC.2014.6911090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6911090","access control;cloud computing;data perturbation;privacy-preserving;retrieval","Cloud computing;Covariance matrices;Data privacy;Generators;Noise;Privacy;Security","authorisation;cloud computing;data privacy;information retrieval;random noise","QoS services;access control process;authorized users;cloud computing;cloud security;data outsourcing;data retrieval algorithm;privacy-preserving methods;random noise generator;retrievable data perturbation method","","0","","","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In NCmH, the randomly generated min-Hash functions are clustered before grouping them into sketches, while spatial information is fully used in this process. The constructed sketches preserve abundant spatial information between visual words, thus NCmH achieves higher retrieval accuracy compared to the standard min-Hash. Furthermore, our method can be combined with other min-Hash algorithms such as GVP mH [1], PmH [2] and TmH [3] to further improve accuracy.

Context-awareness services can be provided depending on user activities extracted from these logs. Recently, a lot of people post a message called tweet within Twitter to show what they are doing, thinking, feeling, and so on. Tweets have potential to record human activities, because many people post tweets so frequently every day. This paper focused on the tweets to retrieve human behavior from them. The length of tweets are limited within short sentence, so this causes some difficulties. The users will use domain-specific terms and will post grammatically incorrect sentences to fit with the constraints. These make us hard to analyze tweets with grammatical manner or with dictionaries. To tackle them, we are applying character n-gram tokenization and naive Bayes classifier to extract appropriate behavioral information from tweets. Using n-gram tokenizer, domain-specific words can be identified and incorrect grammar can be handled. Our approach is examined using real tweets in Japanese. The index of precision, recall and F-measure shows the promising results. Some experiments have been carried out to show the feasibility of our approach.

To attain an efficient execution on highly heterogeneous parallel platforms, the proposed parallelization adopted an unified OpenCL implementation that allows its execution either in CPUs and in multiple and possibly different GPU devices (e.g., NVIDIA and AMD GPUs) that integrate the targeted platform. Furthermore, the proposed implementation incorporates convenient load-balancing techniques, in order to ensure not only a convenient balance of the involved workload to minimize the resulting processing time, but also the possibility to scale the offered throughput with the number of exploited GPUs. The obtained experimental results showed that the proposed multi-GPU parallelization platform is able to offer significant speedups (greater than 10×, when using one single GPU) when compared to conventional mainstream multi-threaded CPU implementations (Bowtie - 8 threads), and between 5× and 30× when compared to other popular BWT-based aligners, namely BWA and SOAP2, using their multi-threading options. When compared with state of the art GPU implementations (e.g., SOAP3, HPG-BWT, Barracuda and CUSHAW2-GPU), the proposed implementation showed to be able to provide speedups between 2.5× and 5×. The execution of the proposed alignment platform when considering multiple and completely distinct GPU devices demonstrated the ability to efficiently scale the resulting throughput, by offering a convenient load-balancing of the involved processing in the several distinct devices.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-5311-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-5313-4; POD:978-1-4799-5160-4","10.1109/HPCSim.2014.6903666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903666","Burrow-Wheeler Transform;FM-index;Graphics Processing Unit (GPU);OpenCL;Parallel Computing;exact string matching","Arrays;Buffer storage;Graphics processing units;Indexes;Instruction sets;Kernel","graphics processing units;indexing;information retrieval;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;string matching;transforms","AMD GPU;Burrows-Wheeler transform;FM index;NVIDIA GPU;backward-search procedure;exact string matching algorithms;graphics processing unit;highly heterogeneous parallel platforms;indexed exact search;indexing techniques;load balancing techniques;multi-GPU OpenCL platform;multi-GPU parallelization;multi-threading options;parallelization","","0","","19","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Motivated by the success of these tools, we investigated the reasonable expectation that end-user programmers would likewise benefit from tools that increased the relative visual weight of important information features. We prototyped and evaluated two tools, each of which uses an existing algorithm to identify the most important lines of code. One prototype highlights important lines of code; the other prototype hides unimportant lines of code. An empirical study revealed that increasing the relative weight of important information features by highlighting did positively impact the amount of information foraged and the rate of information gained; on the other hand, decreasing the relative weight of unimportant information features by hiding had a modest negative impact.

For the prototype system, a Facebook Group was utilised as a repository for learning content and the Open Wonderland platform was selected as a mixed reality intelligent environment for 3D virtual collaborative activities. Since tacit knowledge can be gained via collaborative group-based activities and discussions, a new Wonderland module was developed to integrate this platform with the Facebook group. Similarly, explicit knowledge can be learned directly via the prepared materials which are provided within the group repository. We hope to demonstrate that this approach can provide greater accessibility to the learning content since it can be accessed from both the 3D world and the 2D Facebook Group. In other words, this system can support both synchronous interaction as well as asynchronous data retrieval. Finally, the prototype system was evaluated by means of a two-hour task-based assessment and user-satisfaction questionnaire.

Although significant progress has been made in recent years, relatively little research has focused on semantic labels that are time-varying within a track. Existing approaches and datasets usually assume that different fragments of a track share the same tag labels, disregarding the tags that are time-varying (e.g., mood) or local in time (e.g., instrument solo). In this paper, we present a new dataset dedicated to time-varying music auto-tagging. The dataset, called CAL500exp, is an enriched version of the well-known CAL500 dataset used for conventional track-level tagging. Given the tag set of CAL500, eleven subjects with strong music background were recruited to annotate the time-varying tag labels. A new user interface for annotation is developed to reduce the subject's annotation effort yet increase the quality of labels. Moreover, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the performance improvement CAL500exp brings about for time-varying music auto-tagging. By providing more accurate and consistent descriptions of music content in a finer granularity, CAL500exp may open new opportunities to understand and to model the temporal context of musical semantics.","1945-7871;19457871","Electronic:978-1-4799-4761-4; POD:978-1-4799-4760-7","10.1109/ICME.2014.6890290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890290","Music auto-tagging;annotation interface;dataset construction;temporal context;time-varying","Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Semantics;Tagging;Training;User interfaces;Vectors","information retrieval;music;musical instruments;semantic Web;text analysis;user interfaces","CAL500 dataset;CAL500exp dataset;musical semantics;semantic labels;subject annotation effort;text-based music retrieval;time-varying music auto-tagging;time-varying tag labels;track-level tagging;user interface","","1","","38","","","14-18 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, a new VSA based on multiplication of distributed vectors by random matrices was proposed, this is known as Matrix-Binding-of-Additive-Terms (MBAT). We propose an enhancement that introduces an important additional feature to MBAT: the ability to 'unbind' symbols. We show that our method, which exploits the inherent properties of orthogonal matrices, imparts MBAT with the 'question answering' ability found in other VSAs. We compare our results with another popular VSA that was recently demonstrated to have high utility in brain-inspired machine learning applications.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4003-5; POD:978-1-4799-4004-2","10.1109/ICSC.2014.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882019","brain-inspired machine learning;complex structure methodology;distributed representation;natural language processing;vector symbolic architecture","Decoding;Equations;Knowledge discovery;Mathematical model;Semantics;Symmetric matrices;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;question answering (information retrieval)","MBAT vector symbolic architecture;VSA;brain-inspired machine learning;distributed vectors;information manipulation;information representation;matrix-binding-of-additive-terms;orthogonal matrices;question answering;semantically-structured information","","0","","11","","","16-18 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The user profiles are created for this purpose which gives the user background knowledge description. The concept models are implicitly generated from the user background knowledge. The user background knowledge can be better discovered and represented if global and local analysis is integrated. An ontology is an important concept that can be used to represent the knowledge from the user profiles.

This result, however, is likely to estimate inaccurate values due to overfitting to the explanatory variables. This could result from not having considering cross-validation through the attempts.

However, this means that client applications, and hence end-users, can be exposed to stale data. The degree of staleness observed depends on various tuning knobs set by application developers (customers of key-value stores) and system administrators (providers of key-value stores). Both parties must be cognizant of how these tuning knobs affect the consistency observed by client applications in the interest of both providing the best end-user experience and maximizing revenues for storage providers. Quantifying consistency in a meaningful way is a critical step toward both understanding what clients actually observe, and supporting consistency-aware service level agreements (SLAs) in next generation storage systems. This paper proposes a novel consistency metric called Gamma that captures client-observed consistency. This metric provides quantitative answers to questions regarding observed consistency anomalies, such as how often they occur and how bad they are when they do occur. We argue that Gamma is more useful and accurate than existing metrics. We also apply Gamma to benchmark the popular Cassandra key-value store. Our experiments demonstrate that Gamma is sensitive to both the workload and client-level tuning knobs, and is preferable to existing techniques which focus on worst-case behavior.","1063-6927;10636927","Electronic:978-1-4799-5169-7; POD:978-1-4799-5170-3","10.1109/ICDCS.2014.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888925","benchmarking;distributed systems;eventual consistency;key-value storage;staleness","Benchmark testing;Clocks;Clustering algorithms;Databases;Distributed computing;Tuning","cloud computing;contracts;information retrieval systems","ACID semantics;Cassandra key-value store;application developers;client-centric benchmarking;client-observed consistency;cloud storage system;consistency-aware service level agreements;generation storage system;key-value storage system;system administrators","","8","","30","","","June 30 2014-July 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

TSPs are more expressive for understanding the purposes of website visitors. In this report, we first introduce the concept of throughout-surfing patterns and then present an efficient method for mining the patterns. We propose a compact graph structure, termed a path traversal graph, to record information about the navigation paths of website visitors. The graph contains the frequent surfing paths that are required for mining TSPs. In addition, we devised a graph traverse algorithm based on the proposed graph structure to discover the TSPs. This website will be hosted in a server, where we will be introducing the concept of automatic reconfiguration of storage systems. This system will be providing a master slave server where even if the master server crashes the replica of the data will be stored in the slave server dynamically and the slave server will be automatically configured as the master server.

In this paper, we argue that for some application scenarios returning item bundles is more appropriate than ranked lists. Thus we define composite retrieval as the problem of finding k bundles of complementary items. Beyond complementarity of items, the bundles must be valid w.r.t. a given budget, and the answer set of k bundles must exhibit diversity. We formally define the problem and show that in its general form is NP-hard and that also the special cases in which each bundle is formed by only one item, or only one bundle is sought, are hard. Our characterization however suggests how to adopt a two-phase approach (Produce-and-Choose, or PAC) in which we first produce many valid bundles, and then we choose k among them. For the first phase we devise two ad-hoc clustering algorithms, while for the second phase we adapt heuristics with approximation guarantees for a related problem. We also devise another approach which is based on first finding a k-clustering and then selecting a valid bundle from each of the produced clusters (Cluster-and-Pick, or CAP). We compare experimentally the proposed methods on two real-world data sets: the first data set is given by a sample of touristic attractions in 10 large European cities, while the second is a large database of user-generated restaurant reviews from Yahoo! Local. Our experiments show that when diversity is highly important, CAP is the best option, while when diversity is less important, a PAC approach constructing bundles around randomly chosen pivots, is better.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2014.2306678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742606","Composite retrieval;complementarity;diversity;maximum edge subgraph","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Clustering algorithms;Complexity theory;Linear programming;Polynomials;Urban areas","computational complexity;information retrieval;optimisation;pattern clustering","NP-hard problem;PAC approach;ad-hoc clustering algorithm;approximation guarantee;complementary items;composite retrieval;diverse bundle;item bundles;k-clustering;two-phase approach;user generated restaurant reviews","","5","","23","","20140217","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To fully explore the duality between the two views, we propose a collaborative hashing scheme for the data in matrix form to enable fast search in various applications such as image search using bag of words and recommendation using user-item ratings. By simultaneously preserving both the entity similarities in each view and the interrelationship between views, our collaborative hashing effectively learns the compact binary codes and the explicit hash functions for out-of-sample extension in an alternating optimization way. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three well-known datasets for search inside a single view and search across different views, demonstrating that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with significant accuracy gains ranging from 7.67% to 45.87% relatively.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4799-5118-5; POD:978-1-4799-5119-2","10.1109/CVPR.2014.275","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909672","collaborative hashing;locality sensitive hashing;matrix hashing","Binary codes;Collaboration;Correlation;Nearest neighbor searches;Optimization;Quantization (signal);Search problems","file organisation;information retrieval","bag-of-words;collaborative hashing scheme;collaborative hashing technique;hash functions;image search;matrix form;nearest neighbor search;similarity search;user-item ratings","","12","","20","","","23-28 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our automatic summaries are compared with others produced by commercial and research applications, to demonstrate the appropriateness of using this combination of techniques for automatic summarization.","1089-778X;1089778X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6626-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-1488-3; POD:978-1-4799-1486-9","10.1109/CEC.2014.6900370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900370","","Biological cells;Clustering algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Natural language processing;Semantics;Unified modeling language","genetic algorithms;graph theory;information retrieval;medical computing;pattern clustering","automatic summarization;biomedical summarization;degree centrality;genetic clustering;graph connectivity information;natural language processing;summarization applications;summarization graph-based process","","1","","60","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the many benefits provided by cloud storage, many security problems have also arisen in cloud storage, which prevents companies from migrating their data to cloud storage. As a result, the owners encrypt their sensitive data before storing it in cloud storage. While encryption increases the security of the data, it also reduces the searchability of the data and thus, the efficiency of the search. Recently, research has been done on several schemes which enable keyword searching on encrypted data in cloud computing. However, these schemes contain weaknesses which make them impractical when applied to real-life scenarios. In this paper, we developed a system to support semantic search on encrypted data in cloud computing with three different schemes which are “Synonym-Based Keyword Search (SBKS)”, “Wikipedia-Based Keyword Search (WBKS)”, and “Wikipedia-Based Synonym Keyword Search (WBSKS)”. Our results demonstrated that our schemes are more efficient in terms of performance and storage requirements than the former proposed schemes. Therefore, our developed schemes are more practical than the former proposed schemes.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-5311-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-5313-4; POD:978-1-4799-5160-4","10.1109/HPCSim.2014.6903711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903711","cloud storage;encrypted cloud data;keyword search","Cloud computing;Cryptography;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Indexes;Servers","cloud computing;cryptography;information retrieval;storage management","SBKS;WBKS;WBSKS;Wikipedia-based keyword search;Wikipedia-based synonym keyword search;cloud computing;cloud storage;data searchability;encrypted data;security problems;semantic search;storage requirements;synonym-based keyword search","","2","","11","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper explores the possibility of enriching tourist locations using crowd sourcing approach, which can be used by Tourist Spot Recommender System (TSRS) for mobile users. Proposed crowd sourcing system focuses on getting work done from the crowd currently available at the location under consideration. In proposed system, the contributed information is not limited to ones available on blogs, web pages and sensor-readings from the device etc., but includes proactively-generated user's opinions and perspectives, that are processed to offer immediate knowledge. Our system works in collaboration with a TSRS, takes the list of locations to be recommended to the current user and performs just-in-time information enrichment for those selected set of locations.

At that time, they try to obtain information on the smart phones. In order to search the information of the attractive phrases on web pages, they have to manipulate the smart phones to search on the small screen. It causes stresses because of situations such as manipulation errors. Such stresses could be eliminated if the attractive phrases can be identified and be input automatically in order to recommend the web pages with the information of the attractive phrases. Because of the small screens of smart phones, users move the news article area displayed on the screens with touch gestures such as swipe. The history of touch gestures during browsing an article implies the position and the timing users have focused on in the article. This paper proposes a method to identify the areas where attractive phrases have appeared on news articles, in order to enable automatic identification of attractive phrases. We have achieved real-time identification by utilizing the history of touch gestures during a web news browsing. The proposed method shows the history of touch gestures by a gesture trail. It is a graph showing the time series of the vertical coordinate of the displayed article area. When users encounter attractive phrases, they take certain patterns of touch gestures to confirm or read carefully the neighborhood of the attractive phrases. Thus, in the proposed method, the news article area including an attractive phrase is detected by matching the gesture trail in a sliding time window with a pattern obtained by pre-training. We use slow-down and resting patterns approximated by quadratic functions with the parameters defined for individual users. Experiments to identify time windows of attractive phrases on gesture trails has revealed that the highest and the lowest precision ratios are 0.579 and 0.278, respectively.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3575-8; POD:978-1-4799-3576-5","10.1109/COMPSAC.2014.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899256","mobile device;recommendation;smartphone;touch gesture;web news","Acceleration;Equations;History;Pattern matching;Stress;Training;Web pages","Internet;gesture recognition;information retrieval;smart phones;time series","Web news articles;Web news browsing;Web pages;attractive phrases;automatic identification;gesture trail;manipulation error;mobile devices;quadratic function;real-time identification;resting pattern;sliding time window;slow-down pattern;smart phone users;time series;touch gesture;vertical coordinate","","0","","11","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to protect the data privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a challenging task. Although traditional searchable symmetric encryption schemes allow users to securely search over encrypted data through keywords and selectively retrieve files of interest without capturing any relevance of data files or search keywords, and fuzzy keyword search on encrypted data allows minor typos and format inconsistencies, secure ranked keyword search captures the relevance of data files and returns the results that are wanted most by users. These techniques function unilaterally, which greatly reduces the system usability and efficiency. In this paper, for the first time, we define and solve the problem of privacy-preserving ranked fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data. Ranked fuzzy keyword search greatly enhances system usability and efficiency when exact match fails. It returns the matching files in a ranked order with respect to certain relevance criteria (e.g., keyword frequency) based on keyword similarity semantics. In our solution, we exploit the edit distance to quantify keyword similarity and dictionary-based fuzzy set construction to construct fuzzy keyword sets, which greatly reduces the index size, storage and communication costs. We choose the efficient similarity measure of ""coordinate matching"", i.e., as many matches as possible, to obtain the relevance of data files to the search keywords.","2379-5352;23795352","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2418-9; Electronic:978-1-4799-2419-6; POD:978-1-4799-2420-2","10.1109/PDCAT.2013.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6904261","cloud computing;dictionary-based fuzzy set;fuzzy keyword search;one-to-many order-preserving mapping;ranked keyword search;searchable encryption","Data privacy;Dictionaries;Encryption;Indexes;Keyword search;Servers","cloud computing;cryptography;data protection;dictionaries;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;outsourcing","cloud computing;coordinate matching similarity measure;data owners;data privacy protection;data utilization;dictionary-based fuzzy set construction;edit distance;encrypted cloud data;file retrieval;keyword similarity quantification;keyword similarity semantics;outsourcing;privacy-preserving ranked fuzzy keyword search;relevance criteria;searchable symmetric encryption schemes;system efficiency;system usability","","0","","20","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address these problems from the similarity diffusion perspective among objects on web, and present a clustering-like pattern across similarity cascades (SCs). SCs are a series of subgraphs generated by truncating a weighted graph with a set of thresholds, and then maximal cliques are used to describe the topic candidates. Poisson deconvolution is adopted to efficiently identify the real topics from these topic candidates. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts on two datasets. In addition, we report accuracy v.s. false positives per topic (FPPT) curves for performance evaluation.

LOD incorporates the core data sets in the Semantic Web, yet is not in full conformance with the guidelines for publishing high quality linked data on the Web. Our approach can help in enriching and improving quality of mission-critical links in LOD. Scalable LOD link management requires a hybrid approach, where human intelligent and machine intelligent tasks interleave in a workflow execution. Likewise, many other crowd sourcing applications require a sophisticated workflow specification not only on human intelligent tasks, but also machine intelligent tasks to handle data and control-flow, which is strictly deficient in the existing crowd sourcing platforms. Hence, we are strongly motivated to investigate the interplay of crowd sourcing, and semantically enriched workflows for better human-machine cooperation in task completion. We demonstrate usefulness of our approach through various link creation and verification tasks, and workflows using Amazon Mechanical Turk.

These technologies along with hardware advancements of terrestrial, mobile, and aerial LiDAR scanners are generating huge datasets that contain an enormous amount of exploitable detail. End users are often not able to take advantage of all the data. A new approach offers a solution to access and visualize unlimited amounts of data density and size in real-time on a typical workstation or laptop. By providing real-time visualization and 3D data retrieval, decision makers are afforded unbounded access to all full resolution data for rapid decision making. This solution now provides the ability to host 3D point cloud data in a central repository for enterprise dissemination. Fast and usable internet streaming of dense 3D data is also now available.

The proposed hybrid model is evaluated using a benchmark data set from the i2b2 2009 medication challenge, and is able to achieve an f-score of 66.97%.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5227-4; POD:978-1-4799-5228-1","10.1109/SYSOSE.2014.6892468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892468","Association rules;biomedical named entity recognition;information extraction;medical text mining","Biological system modeling;Biomedical imaging;Databases;Dictionaries;Discharges (electric);Drugs;Feature extraction","data mining;drugs;inference mechanisms;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;medical information systems;text analysis","benchmark data set;biomedical named entity recognition;drug name detection;drug named entity extraction;f-score;hybrid model;inference rules;informal medical text;information extraction;lexicon-based techniques;medication challenge;morphological features;rule-based techniques;speech tags;text mining;unstructured medical text","","2","","33","","","9-13 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Comparative analysis of case retrieval implementation for knowledge intensive CBR application","N. Dendani-hadiby; M. T.

A CBR system is a combination of processes and knowledge called “knowledge containers”, Its reasoning power can be improved through the use of domain knowledge. CBR systems combining case specific knowledge with general domain knowledge models are called Knowledge Intensive CBR (KI-CBR). Although CBR claims to reduce the effort required for developing knowledge-based systems substantially compared with more traditional Artificial Intelligence approaches, the implementation of a CBR application from scratch is still a time consuming task. The present work aims to develop a CBR application for fault diagnosis of steam turbines that integrates a domain knowledge modeling in an ontological form and focuses on the similarity-based retrieval step. This system is view as a KI-CBR system based on domain ontology, built around jCOLIBRI and myCBR a well-known frameworks to design KI-CBR systems. During prototyping, we examine the use and functionality of the focused frameworks. A comparative study is performed with results of presenting a successful retrieval task and demonstrating that jCOLIBRI and myCBR are well adapted to design KI-CBR system.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3823-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-3824-7; POD:978-1-4799-3825-4","10.1109/ICMCS.2014.6911352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6911352","Cases based Reasoning;Fault diagnosis;KI-CBR;domain Ontology;jCOLIBRI;myCBR","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Computer aided software engineering;Lead;Libraries;Numerical models","case-based reasoning;fault diagnosis;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","artificial intelligence;case retrieval implementation;case specific knowledge;case-based reasoning;domain knowledge modeling;fault diagnosis;general domain knowledge models;jCOLIBRI;knowledge containers;knowledge intensive CBR;knowledge-based systems;myCBR;ontological form;steam turbines","","0","","22","","","14-16 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Repositories provide interfaces for users to deposit items, and this involves uploading the document and filling-in the metadata. These interfaces have been criticised for requiring time and effort on the part of the user, especially with the filling-in of the metadata. This paper presents a repository publishing method that aims to counteract this problem. The users' document collections on the desktop are presented in a dynamic, similarity-based interface, allowing them to find, associate and select documents, which can then be uploaded with their exiting metadata to the institutional repository with minimal effort on the part of the user. The demonstration showcases a time and effort-saving method for depositing an item or a set of associated items with metadata to the repository. Adoption of the demonstrated method requires further research in provision of the integration interface and user acceptance.","","Electronic:978-1-905824-44-1; POD:978-1-4799-5444-5","10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2014.6880604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880604","Desktop;Documents;Metadata;Publish;Repository;SWORD","Computers;Educational institutions;Feeds;Organizations;Protocols;Publishing;Resource description framework","Web services;document handling;educational institutions;electronic publishing;information retrieval systems;meta data;user interfaces","SWORD;associated items;direct desktop-repository deposits;document collections;document uploading;dynamic similarity-based interface;effort-saving method;institutional repository;institutional-scale collection;integration interface;item depositing;metadata filling-in;repository publishing method;simple Web service offering repository deposit;time-saving method;user acceptance;user interfaces","","1","","15","","","7-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the Web of Science search engine, we extracted more than 6,000 papers from the Institute for Scientific Information database. Then, we selected 367 highly related journal papers and analyzed them with self-developed software. We found that the TT studies focused on international technology diffusion in the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, these studies used economic models to study TT activities and their impact on economic development at the global, national, and corporate levels. In the 1990s, with the emergence of technology management studies, research on TT emphasized technological issues, such as knowledge management, science and technology (S&T) policy, intellectual property rights management, and TT agents. The TT model in the 2000s (networking type) was more complicated than that in the 1970s (linear type). We successfully analyzed two major research tracks in our study; namely, the “economic” and “management of technology” tracks. The findings from our study will help scholars continue their work in each track. Finally, we also present the notion that there is no “one size fits all” TT model. We believe this is an issue that will lead to further studies.","2159-5100;21595100","Electronic:978-1-890843-29-8; POD:978-1-4799-5769-9; USB:978-1-890843-30-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921247","","Biological system modeling;Economics;Intellectual property;Organizations;Technological innovation;Technology management;Technology transfer","Internet;citation analysis;industrial property;information retrieval;knowledge management;search engines;technology transfer","Institute for Scientific Information database;TT activities;TT agents;TT emphasized technological issues;TT model;TT studies;Web of Science search engine;citation analysis;corporate level;economic development;economic models;global level;intellectual property rights management;international technology diffusion;knowledge management;national level;research tracks;science and technology;self-developed software;technology management studies;technology transfer","","0","","49","","","27-31 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem and the solution approach are implemented in the OpenOpal software which provides a suitable test bed for simulation and optimization (see http://www.openopal.org/). As a result it becomes evident that the genetic algorithm can be improved by changing the selection method and introducing an elitism mechanism.","1089-778X;1089778X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6626-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-1488-3; POD:978-1-4799-1486-9","10.1109/CEC.2014.6900254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900254","","Approximation methods;Educational institutions;Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Shape;Sociology;Statistics","genetic algorithms;information retrieval systems","AS-RS;GA;OpenOpal software;automated storage and retrieval system;elitism mechanism;genetic algorithm;optimal picking order sequence problem","","3","","9","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the prediction medium scale was between 2km and 20km, the forecast aging was between 0 and 3 hours, and the rainfall amount exceeded 20mm during 3 hours. Experimental tests show that the accuracy of the rainstorm forecasting recognition is 87%, false alarm rate is 13%, alarm failure rate is 0, which meet the need of practical application and help people to make more accurate forecast.

Sometimes, the price of the software and licensing fees is also discussed in the licensing agreement, but usually it's described elsewhere. However, typically used catchphrases in software License Agreement make the text of the agreement complex for a common user.
