They have advantages and disadvantages respectively. To overcome their drawbacks and improve the performance without sacrificing the efficiency, we propose the stepwise refinement multimodal image retrieval scheme based on annotation keywords and visual content, which can benefit from the strength of text- and content-based retrieval. The system starts query triggered by some keywords, and further refines the retrieval result based on blobs and regions information. The first step is to complete semantic filtering with weakening visual content, and the second step mainly considers existence and dependence of blobs, and the last step is to quantify the similarity in distribution and layout of visual content between the query image and candidate images by considering the weights of regions. The experiments show that proposed system outperforms the traditional image retrieval systems.","","POD:978-0-7695-3728-3","10.1109/CASE.2009.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5194449","annotation;content-based image retrieval;image retrieval;multimodal","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Educational institutions;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Space technology","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;information filtering","annotation keyword;candidate image;content-based retrieval;multimodal image retrieval system;query processing;region information;semantic filtering;textual metadata;visual content","","4","","10","","","11-12 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Gabor wavelets is especially useful for texture analysis because of the tunable property of its scale and orientation, but it is sensitive to the directional change of a query image. Scale-invariance Gabor representation is used here after the adjustment step which can reduce the rotation variance of the query image to achieve rotation-invariance, scale-invariance and translation-invariance task in the first class. For the images in the latter class we use a combined rotation and scale invariant Gabor representation. The features we used are much less than conventional Gabor wavelets and therefore it is less time-consuming not only in feature extraction but also in similarity measurement.

We focus on the visibility of scenic sights between one tourist spot and another, which is an important factor for choosing a driving route, but has not been considered in traditional tour recommendation systems. To automatically retrieve tourist spots, we propose a personalized tourist spot recommendation technique using the Web information. Although, for some regions, databases of the famous spots exist and are published, such regions are limited and usually outdated. Our method automatically extracts spots from the Web, thus our system is versatile and up-to-date for large regions. To find a route with attractive scenery, we calculate scores for paths based on the visibility of scenic sights. After generating route candidates using GIS, a 3D virtual space is constructed and the Z-Buffer method is used to decide the visibility of scenic sights for each route candidate.

Given a query image, we first perform CBIR to obtain some visually similar image sets corresponding to different visual properties separately. Then, a semantic representation to the query image is learnt from each image set. The semantic consistence among the textual indexes of each image set is measured in order to judge the confidence of various visual properties and the obtained semantic representation in search.

The study of the pianist fingering retrieval has been effectuated on four aspects: preparation and capture of video signal, hand segmentation, finger extraction, feature vector exportation and HMM classifier.","","POD:978-0-7695-3693-4","10.1109/MMEDIA.2009.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206896","Content-based video retrieval;HMM;computer vision;gesture recognition;music interaction","Cameras;Computer vision;Data gloves;Fingers;Hidden Markov models;Human computer interaction;Information analysis;Instruments;Music information retrieval;Speech recognition","computer vision;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;gesture recognition;hidden Markov models;music;object detection;video retrieval","computer vision method;content-based video retrieval;feature vector exportation;finger extraction;fingering detection system;gesture recognition;hand extraction;hand segmentation;hidden Markov model;mathematical theory;music interaction;stochastic processes;video signal","","0","","17","","","20-25 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Politec. de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain","2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","20090811","2009","","","1","6","Spectrum sensing is one key enabler towards opportunistic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. Such scenarios allow cognitive users (a.k.a. secondary users) to access some licensed spectrum band as long as they do not interfere with the licensed (or primary) users. The main goal is to achieve an efficient and utmost access to the otherwise underutilized spectrum resources while still guaranteeing primary users a non-harmful operation. Spectrum sensing can be then used by secondary users to detect spectrum holes that may be accessed in a non-interfering manner. However, spectrum sensing may be subject to errors in the form of false-alarm and misdetection. False-alarm causes spectrum under-use while misdetection leads to spectrum interference between primary and secondary users. Unfortunately, these two magnitudes pose a trade-off on the sensing mechanism: low misdetection is achieved at the expense of high false alarm and vice versa. Consequently, an adequate operating point of the sensing mechanism should be determined. In this work we evaluate the impact of false-alarm and misdetection errors on the performance of a spectrum sensing scenario. We use a discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) model and we determine the suitable operating point for the sensing mechanism under different traffic load conditions such that some quality of service is attained by both primary and secondary users. Performance results reveal that by effectively choosing the operation point bearing in mind the traffic load levels will lead to enhanced perceived quality of service of both primary and secondary users.","1550-3607;15503607","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199018","","Ad hoc networks;Chromium;Cognitive radio;Communications Society;Councils;Information retrieval;Interference;Quality of service;Standardization;Telecommunication traffic","Markov processes;cognitive radio;quality of service;radio spectrum management","cognitive radio networks;discrete time Markov chain;licensed spectrum band;opportunistic spectrum access;quality of service;secondary users;spectrum interference;spectrum sensing","","1","","13","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A resource selection based on computational resource information complemented with network performance information has the potential to be optimal from the application performance viewpoint. This is particularly true for network-intensive distributed applications. This study proposes a recursive distributed topology discovery service (RD-TDS) that allows grid clients to retrieve network performance information (i.e., IP-level topology and link capacity) without the need of specific administrative privileges. The RD-TDS exploits a selected set of distributed beacons (i.e., measurement points) that recursively probe newly discovered nodes until no undiscovered nodes are found during an exploration step. The RD-TDS simulative and experimental evaluation confirms its expected qualities: a rapid and complete discovery of the network performance information with the utilization of a limited number of active beacons. In addition, the proposed method rationale can be easily applied to many current network exploration tools.","1550-3607;15503607","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198661","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198661","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Electronic mail;Grid computing;High performance computing;Information retrieval;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Probes","computer network performance evaluation;grid computing;resource allocation;telecommunication network topology","computational resource information;distributed application performance;distributed beacons;network performance information;network-aware grid clients;network-intensive distributed applications;recursive distributed topology discovery service;resource selection","","0","1","17","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SFLS has clear geometric-theory foundation and its implementation is relatively simple. In experiments based on artificial datasets and real-world datasets, comparisons between SFLS and other classification methods are provided, including nearest neighbor (NN), k-NN, NFL and some refined NFL methods.

They provide security against man in the middle attacks, as long as the the client connecting to those services knows the certificates or host keys a priori. A simple solution used in practice is to trust the certificate or the host key when the client connects to a server for the first time. This approach is susceptible to man in the middle attacks, a fact exploited by adversaries in a variety of attacks against unsuspecting users. We develop a simple and scalable solution named DoubleCheck to protect against such attacks. Our solution is achieved by retrieving the certificate from a remote host using multiple alternate paths. Our scheme does not require any new infrastructure; we make use of the Tor anonymity system to reach the destination using multiple independent paths. Hence our solution is easy to deploy in practice. Our solution does not introduce any privacy concerns. We have implemented DoubleCheck as SSH and Firefox extensions, demonstrating its practicality. Our experimental evaluation shows that the impact of DoubleCheck on performance is minimal, since the Tor network is used only for retrieving the certificate for the first time, while the data transfer and subsequent connection establishment follow normal routing rules. Our scheme is an effective way of mitigating the impact of man in the middle attacks without requiring new infrastructure and at low overhead.","1530-1346;15301346","POD:978-1-4244-4672-8","10.1109/ISCC.2009.5202224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202224","Certificates;Man-in-the-middle attack;Tor;Trust","Cities and towns;Computer science;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Network servers;Privacy;Protection;Protocols;Public key;Routing","data privacy;program verification;public key cryptography","Tor anonymity system;host key;multipath verification;public key infrastructure;security","","6","1","20","","","5-8 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, we perform a video temporal segmentation by detecting cuts, fades, dissolves and specific color effects. Second, we analyze the movie rhythm, in terms of shot changes over a time unit. We target several action categories, namely: hot action, regular action and low action. This constitutes the action groundtruth.

In our framework any traditional measure of similarity / dissimilarity has its contextual counterpart. We show that for two important families of divergences (Bregman and Csisz'ar), the contextual similarity computation consists in solving a convex optimization problem. We focus on the case of multinomials and explain how to compute in practice the similarity for several well-known measures. These contextual measures are then applied to the image retrieval problem. In such a case, the context u is estimated from the neighbors of a query q. One of the main benefits of our approach lies in the fact that using different contexts, and especially contexts at multiple scales (i.e. broad and narrow contexts), provides different views on the same problem. Combining the different views can improve retrieval accuracy. We will show on two very different datasets (one of photographs, the other of document images) that the proposed measures have a relatively small positive impact on macro Average Precision (which measures purely ranking) and a large positive impact on micro Average Precision (which measures both ranking and consistency of the scores across multiple queries).","1063-6919;10636919","POD:978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206505","","Animals;Cats;Europe;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Painting;Pattern analysis;Q measurement;Rendering (computer graphics)","convex programming;image retrieval","contextual measure;contextual similarity computation;convex optimization problem;image retrieval problem;macro average precision;micro average precision","","7","","20","","","20-25 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A large number of shape similarity approaches have been developed, with the main focus being the comparison or matching of pairs of shapes. In these approaches, other shapes do not influence the similarity measure of a given pair of shapes. In the proposed approach, other shapes do influence the similarity measure of each pair of shapes, and we show that this influence is beneficial even in the unsupervised setting (without any prior knowledge of shape classes). The influence of other shapes is propagated as a diffusion process on a graph formed by a given set of shapes. However, the classical diffusion process does not perform well in shape space for two reasons: it is unstable in the presence of noise and the underlying local geometry is sparse. We introduce a locally constrained diffusion process which is more stable even if noise is present, and we densify the shape space by adding synthetic points we call 'ghost points'. We present experimental results that demonstrate very significant improvements over state-of-the-art shape matching algorithms.

Location history data is required for the central call server to provide a map display of 'needy' customer spots to an empty taxi. Location tracker tracks the location of the taxi and stores it in a memory structure which provides a history of the locations traveled by the taxi in order to use it in future to generate reports which help in post accident analysis. Other mechanisms such as state tracer and pickup pattern provide further analysis information about the location and the speed of the taxi.","","POD:978-0-7695-3605-7","10.1109/CSO.2009.445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5193812","","Algorithm design and analysis;Feedback;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Process design;Query processing;Set theory;Telematics","cartography;electronic data interchange;query processing;road vehicles;traffic information systems","central call server;location history data;location tracker;pickup pattern;query processing;spatial data management;state tracer;taxi telematics system;vehicular telematics system","","0","","8","","","24-26 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reversible information embedding (RIE) extends this model by adding the requirement of decoding the host signal. In some applications however, this requirement is too strong. For example, if the user is interested in decoding the data and further transmitting the stegotext, i.e. the result of the embedding of independent data into the host, then full decoding of the host is not needed, only re-production of the stegotext. This work expands the study of information embedding channels by adding the requirement of retrieving the stegotext at the destination. A single-letter characterization of the achievable rate-distortion region is developed. In particular, it is shown that a rate higher than the RIE rate can be achieved, under the (more relaxed) requirement of stegotext decoding. Two examples are solved, and an iterative algorithm that computes numerically the capacity is provided.","2157-8095;21578095","POD:978-1-4244-4312-3","10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5205855","Arimoto-Blahut algorithm;Stegotext reversibility;information embedding;state dependent channels","Channel capacity;Communication channels;Costs;Degradation;Entropy;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Iterative decoding;Rate-distortion;Writing","channel capacity;channel coding;iterative decoding;rate distortion theory;signal processing;steganography;telecommunication security","achievable rate-distortion region;host signal decoding;independent data transmission;information embedding;iterative algorithm;noisy channel capacity;reversible stegotext;single-letter characterization","","10","","13","","","June 28 2009-July 3 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206848","","Explosions;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Internet;Large-scale systems;Multimedia databases;Ontologies;Robustness;Spine","Internet;computer vision;image resolution;image retrieval;multimedia computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);trees (mathematics);very large databases;visual databases","ImageNet database;Internet;computer vision;image resolution;image retrieval;large-scale hierarchical image database;large-scale ontology;multimedia data;subtree;wordNet structure","","389","35","28","","","20-25 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Shots can be retrieved either by querying on a single frame with the desired pose, or through a pose classifier trained from a set of pose examples. Our main contribution is an effective system for retrieving people based on their pose, and in particular we propose and investigate several pose descriptors which are person, clothing, background and lighting independent. As a second contribution, we improve the performance over existing methods for localizing upper body layout on unconstrained video.

Two-level fingerprinting and traceability codes have the following property: As in traditional (one-level) codes, when given an illegal copy produced by a coalition of users, the decoder identifies one of the guilty users if the coalition size is less than a certain threshold t. Moreover, even when the coalition is of a larger size s (> t), the decoder still provides partial information by tracing one of the groups containing a guilty user.

An innovative regularization approach implementing a penalty on abrupt spatial variations of the currents is proposed to alleviate this difficulty. Various schemes to mesh the equivalent current distribution are also explored.

In ranking, the pursued goal is global: based on past data, define an order on the whole input space X, so that positive instances take up the top ranks with maximum probability. The most natural way to order all instances consists of projecting the input data onto the real line through a real-valued scoring function s and use the natural order on R. The accuracy of the ordering induced by a candidate <i>s</i> is classically measured in terms of the ROC curve or the AUC. Here we discuss the design of tree-structured scoring functions obtained by recursively maximizing the AUC criterion. The connection with recursive piecewise linear approximation of the optimal ROC curve both in the L<sub>1</sub>-sense and in the L<sub>infin</sub>-sense is highlighted. A novel tree-based algorithm for ranking, called TreeRank, is proposed. Consistency results and generalization bounds of functional nature are established for this ranking method, when considering either the L<sub>1</sub> or L<sub>infin</sub> distance. We also describe committee-based learning procedures using TreeRank as a ldquobase ranker,rdquo in order to overcome obvious drawbacks of such a top-down partitioning technique.

A novel localised optimisation technique designed to be used in conjunction with existing global path strategies is presented here. The proposed technique considers dynamic radio conditions and optimises localised collection strategy accordingly. This is achieved using a naive Bayesian classifier trained to detect and react to different radio conditions observed through onboard diagnostics. The approach is evaluated using a series of real world experiments. Results indicate localised optimisation to provide measurable improvements, especially under complex and unpredictable radio conditions riddled with path loss, reflection, and noise.

That requirement calls for suitable context-aware middlewares capable of retrieving and using context data to personalize service provisioning. However, existing solutions still exhibit very limited support for context data management and distribution, especially in wide-scale and highly heterogeneous systems. The paper proposes a novel context-aware middleware to achieve scalability in context data dissemination.

A rough segmentation separates audio input into audio clips based on silence detection in the time domain. Then a self-similarity matrix, based on selected audio features in the frequency domain to discover the level of similarity between frames in the audio clip, is calculated. Subsequently an edge detection method is used to find regions in the similarity image that determine plausible sounds in the audio clip. The results of the two phases are combined to form the final boundaries for the input audio. This two-phase method is evaluated using established methods and a standard non-musical database. The method reported here offers more accurate segmentation results than existing methods for audio segmentation. We propose that this approach could be adapted as an efficient preprocessing stage in other audio processing systems such as audio retrieval, classification, music analysis and summarization.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-4290-4","10.1109/ICME.2009.5202574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202574","Audio segmentation;edge detection;similarity map","Acoustic signal detection;Artificial neural networks;Audio databases;Computational Intelligence Society;Computer science;Hidden Markov models;Image edge detection;Mathematical model;Music information retrieval;Speech","audio databases;audio signal processing;content-based retrieval;music","audio classification;audio clips;audio processing systems;audio retrieval;edge detection method;general audio segmentation;monophonic heterogeneous audio files;music analysis;music summarization;self-similarity matrix;silence detection;standard nonmusical database;time domain;two phase method","","2","","14","","","June 28 2009-July 3 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering is used to group image regions into prototypical region clusters that summarize the training data and can be used as the basis of annotating new test images. Since this problem involves clustering sparse and high dimensional data, we use a semi-supervised constrained clustering algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and feature discrimination. The constraints consist of pairs of image regions that should not be included in the same cluster. These constraints are deduced from the irrelevance of all concepts annotating the training images. The constraints help in guiding the clustering process. The GSJ algorithm uses the fuzzy membership function of each region cluster. Finally, Bayes rule is used to label images based on the posterior probability of each concept. The proposed algorithm was implemented and tested on a data set that includes 3000 images using four-fold cross validation.","1530-1346;15301346","POD:978-1-4244-4672-8","10.1109/ISCC.2009.5202230","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202230","clustering;constrained clustering;content-based image retrieval;image annotation","Bayesian methods;Clustering algorithms;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Labeling;Prototypes;Testing","belief networks;greedy algorithms;image retrieval;unsupervised learning","Bayes rule;constrained clustering;content-based image retrieval;feature discrimination;fuzzy clustering;greedy selection and joining algorithm;image annotation;semi-naive Bayesian model","","0","","40","","","5-8 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the problem of communication cost minimization is a large optimization problem (NP-hard) and requires global information (i.e., not scalable), in this paper the service migration philosophy is adopted which permits service facility movements and yields smaller communication cost in a scalable manner (i.e., based on local information). Service migration is incorporated in the Chord P2P system, imposing certain changes (e.g., the extension of the service discovery scheme of Chord) and introducing an extra system overhead (i.e., update messages) for the efficient operation of the (enhanced) system. As it is demonstrated here using simulation results, the communication cost corresponding to the extra system overhead is significantly small and more than enough compensated for by the communication cost reduction due to the introduction of service migration. As long as the network remains unchanged, the former communication cost is paid only once while the latter communication cost reduction is permanent.","","POD:978-1-4244-4660-5","10.1109/MEDHOCNET.2009.5205198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5205198","","Cost function;Informatics;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Network servers;Peer to peer computing","cost reduction;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication network planning","Chord P2P system;communication cost reduction;peer-to-peer network system design;service discovery;service migration","","0","","16","","","June 29 2009-July 1 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main idea behind IHCT is that nonverbal behaviors displayed when interacting with multimedia data (e.g., facial expressions, head nods, etc.) provide information useful for improving the tag sets associated with the data. As such behaviors are displayed naturally and spontaneously, no effort is required from the users, and this is why the resulting tagging process is said to be ""implicit"". Tags obtained through IHCT are expected to be more robust than tags associated with the data explicitly, at least in terms of: generality (they make sense to everybody) and statistical reliability (all tags will be sufficiently represented).

Such an approach can support any sophisticated applications and well-formed XML documents. When XML data stored in an XRDB, the user query must be translated into the corresponding SQL commands, then executed in the relational database. However, most model-mapping-schema-based approaches have a potential performance problem for retrieving XML data from an XRDB, because a large number of join operations are needed. In this paper, a novel query preprocessing technique was proposed to reduce the number of join operations from the corresponding SQL commands. The rationale behind our approach is to replace join operations by predefined constant-mapping selection operations. By reducing the number of join operations, the performance of query processing can be greatly improved.

Such false alarms often overload the sensor-to-fusion-center communications links and fusion/tracking processes, producing too many false tracks. The specular-cued surveillance Web (SPECSweb) multistatic tracker mitigates these problems through implementation of two amplitude thresholds: a high threshold used to identify the occurrence of high-strength specular detections cues for track initiation, and a low threshold for selective extraction of additional detections for track extension forward and backward in time. This approach can significantly reduce the data rate at the input to the fusion/tracking algorithm, and reduce node-to-fusion-center communication link throughput requirements. A recent extension to the SPECSweb algorithm is the incorporation of bistatic range-rate measurements, and this implementation is described. The tracker is then applied to a challenging real multistatic data set obtained from the SEABAR'07 sea trial. The results shows effective tracking performance using this approach, yielding high quality target tracks with few false tracks. The method is shown to have excellent potential in reducing the overloading of the communication links, the automated tracking algorithm, and ultimately, the operator.","","POD:978-0-9824-4380-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5203668","Cueing;Multi-sensor Fusion;Multistatic Sonar;Retrospective Tracking;Specular;Target Strength","Acoustic pulses;Acoustic signal detection;Data mining;Geometry;Information retrieval;Robustness;Sea measurements;Sonar measurements;Surveillance;Target tracking","Internet;electrical engineering computing;feature extraction;sensor fusion;sonar detection;sonar signal processing;sonar tracking","SEABAR'07 dataset;SPECSweb algorithm;automated tracking algorithm;false alarm clutter;fusion-tracking processes;high-strength specular detection;multistatic active sonar contact fusion;node-to-fusion-center communication link throughput;selective extraction;sonar nodes;specular-cued multistatic sonar tracking;specular-cued surveillance Web multistatic tracker;track initiation","","1","","16","","","6-9 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially we focus on the tyre evaluation by kart team mechanics. The proposed application should be a valid aid to the tyre companies. Specially the work is focused on all those companies whose clients are kart teams. Since kart world has not the same fundings availability as F1, we have to deploy a very cheap survey. For this purpose, RFID technology is a good choice, considering particularly passive RFID tags. Passive tags are embedded into the tyre during the vulcanization step. Then the tag can be read by a reader and the retrieved data are transferred to Web and to a database server in order to collect more information about the tyre. Finally, the mechanics rate the analized tyre by filling a satisfaction form. Moreover all the rates can be analyzed by the tyre company in order to evaluate the quality of its products.","","POD:978-1-4244-3540-1","10.1109/SOLI.2009.5203903","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5203903","","Costs;Customer satisfaction;Information retrieval;Internet;Passive RFID tags;Protocols;Radiofrequency identification;Security;Supply chains;Tires","Internet;customer satisfaction;production engineering computing;protocols;radiofrequency identification;tyres","Internet protocols;RFID technology;database server;kart racing;online customer satisfaction survey;passive RFID tags;race tyre companies customer satisfaction;tyre evaluation;vulcanization step","","0","","10","","","22-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the crop management practices of the Junchuan Farm, key soil and crop canopy parameters were applied to develop a biomass model for retrieving district evapotranspiration. Using the mass of dry matter on ground, apportionment coefficient and the corresponding experience expressions deduce the computing model of daily evapotranspiration. The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) model is a near real time evapotranspiration monitoring approach. This article uses SEBAL as a referenced model to explain the possibility of using the model of biomass to monitor district evapotranspiration. The results show that the spatial distributions of the retrieved results for these two models are similar.

Although hierarchical quantization has the merit of retrieval efficiency, the resulting visual vocabulary representation usually faces two crucial problems: (1) hierarchical quantization errors and biases in the generation of “visual words”; (2) the model cannot adapt to database variance. In this paper, we describe an unsupervised optimization strategy in generating the hierarchy structure of visual vocabulary, which produces a more effective and adaptive retrieval model for large-scale search. We adopt a novel density-based metric learning (DML) algorithm, which corrects word quantization bias without supervision in hierarchy optimization, based on which we present a hierarchical rejection chain for efficient online search based on the vocabulary hierarchy. We also discovered that by hierarchy optimization, efficient and effective transfer of a retrieval model across different databases is feasible. We deployed a large-scale image retrieval system using a vocabulary tree model to validate our advances. Experiments on UKBench and street-side urban scene databases demonstrated the effectiveness of our hierarchy optimization approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206680","","Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Layout;Optimization methods;Quantization;Visual databases;Vocabulary","database indexing;image retrieval;optimisation;quantisation (signal);search problems;trees (mathematics);unsupervised learning;vocabulary","DML algorithm;adaptive retrieval model;database inverted indexing;density-based metric learning algorithm;hierarchical quantization error;image descriptor;image retrieval system;large-scale search problem;transferable retrieval system;unsupervised optimization strategy;visual vocabulary representation;vocabulary tree model;word quantization bias","","2","","24","","","20-25 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a densely deployed WMSN, there exists correlation among the visual information observed by cameras with overlapped field of views. In this paper, the correlation characteristics of visual information are used to address two issues: 1) how to measure the amount of visual information provided by multiple cameras in the network, and 2) how to select a group of cameras to report their information to the sink under distortion constraints. An entropy-based analytical framework is developed to measure the amount of visual information provided by multiple correlated cameras first. Based on this framework, a correlation-based camera selection scheme is introduced. Simulation results show that, given a distortion bound at the sink, the correlation-based selection scheme requires fewer cameras to report to the sink than the random selection scheme.","1550-3607;15503607","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199112","","Bandwidth;Cameras;Communications Society;Distortion measurement;Image retrieval;Image sensors;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Streaming media;Wireless sensor networks","cameras;correlation methods;multimedia communication;optical information processing;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","multiple correlated camera;overlapped field of view;visual information;wireless multimedia sensor networks","","3","","9","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using characteristics of punctuation, sentence length and Chinese-Uighur correspondence information,the anchor points with 1:1 pattern sentence pairs are identified to suppress mistakes spread. Among anchor points, a hybrid strategy based on both length and punctuation is used to align sentences. Experimental results verified the high precision of identifying anchor points and the effective restraint of the spread of alignment mistakes; Hybrid alignment algorithm avoids the weakness of high time complexity alignment algorithms based on word.

The accuracy of image retrieval methods is subject to effective extraction of image features such as color, texture, and shape. In this paper we propose a new image retrieval method using contourlet transform coefficients. We use the properties of contourlet coefficients to assign the normal distribution function to the distribution of coefficients in each sub-band. The assigned normal distribution functions are used to extract the texture feature vector at the next stage. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other conventional texture image retrieval methods such as, Gabor filter and wavelet transform. Moreover, this method shows a noticeable higher performance compared to another contourlet based method.","","POD:978-1-4244-3785-6","10.1109/ISSCS.2009.5206182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206182","","Content based retrieval;Content management;Digital images;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Software libraries;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;image texture;wavelet transforms","Gabor filter;content based image retrieval;contourlet transform coefficient;databases;digital image libraries;image feature extraction;normal distribution function;simulation result;texture feature vector extraction;texture image retrieval;wavelet transform","","5","","13","","","9-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
