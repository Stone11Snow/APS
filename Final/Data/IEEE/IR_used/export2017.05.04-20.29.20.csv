Mobile agents travel through servers to perform their programs. Maintaining mobile agent availability in the presence of agent server's crash, during their travel, is a challenging issue, since, developers normally have no control over remote agent servers. In the context of mobile agents, fault tolerance is crucial to enable the integration of mobile agent technology into today's business applications. In multi mobile agent deployment, communication among mobile agents is another aspect to concentrate. When it ensures the aliveness of other agents, agent reliability and data availability, there is a need to locate agents to implement the communication aspect.

Among these imaging modalities, PET imaging is capable of retrieving functional information from image sequences because tracer kinetic modeling can be used to aid the understanding of images. In this paper we investigate the brain neurotransmitter imaging with nonlinear compartmental model. We propose a fast and robust method to quantify such model from PET data using Volterra expansion of nonlinear systems. A reliable and robust quantitative biomarker based on Volterra kernels is introduced to identify the receptor concentrations.

It has a lot of useful information including users' real voice such as review of new product, event information, and so on. However, sufficiently efficient functions for information search are not yet available to everyday users. BBS articles posted by general public have a lot of colloquial expressions and various expression patterns of same word. Therefore common searching methods, keyword matching and cosine similarity searching, can extract a lot of articles users do not want. As the result, it requires a fair amount of time for users to see if retrieved articles are necessary for them. The achievement of more efficiently retrieval function has been desired. A retrieval method using users' evaluations of articles has been proposed. In this method, search user evaluates each retrieved thread on binary of whether its content suits the retrieval question. And when a new retrieval query is entered, the past evaluations by retrieval queries similar to the new query are used as feedback. It can improve retrieval accuracy on BBS browsed by many users and updated frequently, because a lot of evaluations can be stored. When there are few evaluations, however, this method makes a false selection of evaluations used as feedback. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a feedback method using users' evaluations for evaluated number independent retrieval. In our method, appropriate feedback is achieved by using word co-occurrence information in articles and making word statistic classes, even if there are few evaluations. By using our method, the number of correct articles in retrieved result was increased compared to the conventional one when there are few evaluations.","1553-572X;1553572X","Electronic:978-1-4244-4650-6; POD:978-1-4244-4648-3","10.1109/IECON.2009.5415357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5415357","","Information retrieval","information retrieval;query formulation","BBS articles;bulletin board system;cosine similarity searching;evaluated number independent retrieval;information search;keyword matching;retrieval query;user evaluation;word cooccurrence information utilization;word statistic classes","","1","","10","","","3-5 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, very few studies in this area deal with artificial intelligence or AI tools. Knowing the power of meta-heuristics in problem solving, we suggest exploring information retrieval with an evolutionary approach. It appears that the methodology that seems structurally well suited to this problem is undoubtedly scatter search. The concept of similarity in IR between a query and a document according to the vector space model is correlated to the concept of the distance between solutions in scatter search. In this paper, we design and implement a scatter search algorithm for information retrieval called SS-IR. The algorithm is tested on the well known smart collections and large data sets built for experimentation purposes. Numerical results are encouraging and show an interesting performance for the algorithm especially for large scale information retrieval.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5052-7; POD:978-1-4244-5053-4","10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5393404","component;evolutionary approach;large scale information retrieval;meta-heuristic;scatter search","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial intelligence;Biological cells;Computer science;Genetic algorithms;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Scattering;Space exploration;Testing","information retrieval;search problems;vectors","large-scale information retrieval;metaheuristic;scatter search;vector space model","","0","","12","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are several types of uncertainty and fuzziness associated with IRS like search term uncertainty, relevance uncertainty involved in retrieving of irrelevant documents. The aim of this paper is to eliminate different types of uncertainty and increase the chance of retrieving relevant documents. In the framework a method is proposed which first calculate query and document cluster similarity which not only retrieve the documents matching query terms as well as similar to retrieved documents by calculating the query and cluster similarity. This helps to reduce search term uncertainty and tries to reduce the fuzziness associated with document relevance in two steps. First modification is made in general term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) scoring mechanism to give importance of informativeness of a document contents and secondly calculating query and document summary overlap. All the above information is used to measure the document relevant score. Finally retrieved documents are filtered by Pearson correlation coefficient between query vector and document vector to find out only those documents correlated with query. In experiment standard NPL test collection prepared by Vaswani and Cameron at the National Physical Laboratory in England was used. After full implementation of above methodology it was found that proposed work is better in comparison with existing methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5540-9; POD:978-1-4244-5537-9","10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5564542","Clustering;Correlation ratio;Document cluster;Document summary;Fuzzy cmeans;Information Retrieval;document frequency","Correlation;Discrete wavelet transforms","correlation methods;document handling;fuzzy set theory;information filtering;information retrieval systems;pattern clustering;relevance feedback;search problems;vectors","IRS;National Physical Laboratory;Pearson correlation coefficient;document cluster similarity;document relevance;document summary;document vector;fuzziness;fuzzy c-means clustering;information retrieval system;irrelevant documents;modified vector space model;query vector;relevant document retrieval;search term uncertainty;standard NPL test collection;term frequency-inverse document frequency;tf-idf scoring mechanism","","1","","7","","","9-11 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In Computer Aided Assessment (CAA) of narrative answers, when model answers are available, the similarity score between Students' Answers and the respective Model Answer may be a good quality-indicator. With such an analogy in mind, we applied basic IR techniques in the context of automatic assessment and discussed our findings. In this paper, we explain the development of a web-based automatic assessment system that incorporates 5 different text analysis techniques for automatic assessment of narrative answers using vector space framework. We apply Uni-gram, Bi-gram, TF.IDF, Keyphrase Extraction, and Keyphrase with Synonym Resolution before representing model answers and students' answers as document vectors; and then we compute document similarity scores.

A fundamental problem in Peer-to-Peer networks is how to locate appropriate peers efficiently to answer a specific query (Query routing). This paper proposes a semantic model in , which a query can be routed for appropriate peers instead of broadcasting or using random selection. This semantic is generally built from the contents of the peers, but can also bring in the implicit behavior of the users. The main objective of this model is to achieve better results in non-supervised tasks through the incorporation of usage data obtained from past search queries. This type of model allows us to discover the motivations of users when visiting a certain documents and peers. The terms used in past queries can provide a better choice of features queries. Hence, for each peer, our model learns from past queries to represent correlation between queries terms, documents and peers. We implemented the proposed strategy, and compared its routing effectiveness in terms of both recall and messages traffic with a broadcasting scheme (without learning). To test the proposed algorithm, we defined a layer of routing on the PeerSim simulator. Experimental results show the model is efficient and performs better than other non-semantic query routing models with respect to accuracy. In addition, our approach improves the recall rate nearly 90% while reducing message traffic dramatically compared with Gnutella protocol.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6729-7; POD:978-1-4244-6728-0","10.1109/ICIW.2010.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476745","Information retrieval;P2P;Semantic routing","Business communication;Costs;Information retrieval;Integer linear programming;Multimedia communication;Quality of service;Query processing;Service oriented architecture;Web and internet services;Web services","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;query processing","Internet;P2P;PeerSim simulator;information retrieval;messages traffic;peer-to-peer system;query routing;random selection","","4","","17","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because singing voices play an important role in musical pieces with vocals, such representation is useful for music information retrieval systems. The main problem in modeling the characteristics of a singing voice is the negative influences caused by accompaniment sounds. To solve this problem, we developed two methods, <i>accompaniment sound reduction and reliable frame selection</i> <b>.</b> The former makes it possible to calculate feature vectors that represent a spectral envelope of a singing voice after reducing accompaniment sounds. It first extracts the harmonic components of the predominant melody from sound mixtures and then resynthesizes the melody by using a sinusoidal model driven by these components. The latter method then estimates the reliability of frame of the obtained melody (i.e., the influence of accompaniment sound) by using two Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) for vocal and nonvocal frames to select the reliable vocal portions of musical pieces. Finally, each song is represented by its GMM consisting of the reliable frames. This new representation of the singing voice is demonstrated to improve the performance of an automatic singer identification system and to achieve an MIR system based on vocal timbre similarity.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2010.2041386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5410057","Music information retrieval (MIR);singer identification;singing voice;vocal;vocal timbre similarity","Feature extraction;Helium;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Robustness;Signal processing;Timbre","Gaussian processes;audio signal processing;feature extraction;information retrieval","Gaussian mixture models;accompaniment sound reduction;frame selection reliability;musical instruments;polyphonic musical audio signals;predominant melody;singer identification;vocal-timbre-similarity-based music information retrieval","","33","","27","","","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, this task usually spends much computational time to search on large DNA sequence database. This paper presents an efficient hierarchical method to improve the search speed while the accurate is being kept constant. For a given query sequence, firstly, a fast histogram method is used to scan the sequences in the database. A large number of DNA sequences with low similarity will be excluded for latter searching. The Smith-Waterman algorithm is then applied to each remainder sequences. Experimental results show the proposed method combining histogram information and Smith-Waterman algorithm is a more efficient algorithm for DNA sequence retrieval.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3880-8; POD:978-1-4244-5339-9","10.1109/FITME.2009.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381043","DNA sequence;Fast retrieval;Histogram information;Smith-Waterman algorithm","Bioinformatics;DNA;Databases;Dynamic programming;Genomics;Heuristic algorithms;Histograms;Information retrieval;Proteins;Sequences","bioinformatics;database management systems;information retrieval","DNA sequence database;DNA sequence retrieval;Smith-Waterman algorithm;bioinformatics algorithm development;histogram information","","0","","10","","","13-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method is for the spatially predicted I-frames in the H.264 video coding standard. In I-Frame coding various prediction modes can be used for spatially predicting pixels of a block from upper or left side adjacent pixels. The selected prediction mode for a block indicates the way in which pixels of that block are related to their neighboring parts. Hence, we propose to use the histogram of the prediction modes as a texture descriptor of compressed I-frames. Since the method is based on independent I-Frame coded pictures, it can be used either for video analysis of H.264 coded videos or image retrieval of the I-frame based coded images such as advanced image coding. The simulation results indicate that this method has superior performance and lower computational load compared to an efficient realization of pixel domain texture retrieval method based on Gabor filter. Moreover, it is also robust to variations in image and coding parameters. Hence, this method is a powerful tool for visual information analysis in a wide range of applications.","0098-3063;00983063","","10.1109/TCE.2010.5505994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5505994","Texture based retrieval, Compressed domain, I-frame, Prediction Mode Histogram (PMH), H.264 standard","Computational modeling;Gabor filters;Histograms;Image analysis;Image coding;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Robustness;Video coding;Video compression","","","","9","","28","","","May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, retrieving valuable information is another problem needs to be solved. Most transactions are completed by credit card through delivering id number and the personal data of the user in the Internet to the server. Then the server will know the privacy of users. It will become a challenge to PIR schemes considering the e-payment need. In this paper, a novel PIR scheme is proposed which uses a secure coprocessor (SC), with e-payment scheme for protecting the privacy of customers in querying valuable information.

In contrast to traditional content based image retrieval systems that work with entire images, the proposed tool analyses individual objects. Defined objects are produced by performing the segmentation inside a multi-dimensional BPT. The tree structure is colour based with the advantage of incorporating spatial frequency to form semantically meaningful tree nodes. The BPTs can be intuitively browsed and stored within XML documents. To perform retrieval when post processing, a node of the query image is matched against the nodes of the BPT in the database representation. These are matched according to a combination of MPEG-7 descriptors, including colour, texture and edge histograms. The paper illustrates how the use of multi-dimensional information stored within BPTs, can significantly enhance content retrieval results for natural images. Performance evaluation results show how influential the quality segmentations are within retrieval results.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3893-8; POD:978-1-4244-5257-6","10.1109/CVMP.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5430067","MPEG 7;management systems;post processing;segmentation and matting;visual media production","Content based retrieval;Content management;Frequency;Image analysis;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Production systems;Tree data structures;XML","content management;content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;image retrieval;image segmentation;trees (mathematics);video coding","MPEG-7 descriptors;binary partition tree;content based image retrieval;content management systems;multidimensional information;semi-automatic content retrieval;visual media production","","0","","12","","","12-13 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this decoupled system, the IR serves as a lightweight, data-driven pronunciation model. Our proposed method is evaluated in the Windows Live Search for Mobile (WLS4M) task, and our best system has 12% fewer errors than a comparable HMM classifier.

However, it is a costly operation since it consumes node and link resources excessively, which are often unnecessarily. There is no reason, for example, for a peer to receive a query message if the peer has no matching resource or is not on the path to a peer holding a matching resource. However, how to quickly discover the right resource in a large-scale P2P network without generating too much network traffic and with minimum possible time remain highly challenging. In this paper, we propose a new peer-to-peer (P2P) search method aiming at exploiting data mining concepts (Decision Tree) to improve search performance for information retrieval in P2P network. We use a PDMS system, which aims to combine a Super-Peer (SP) based network with the capability of managing a data model attached to the peers in the form of relational, xml, or object schemes. Each SP is connected to a Global-Knowledge-Super-Peer (GKSP) that operates with an index (decision tree), to predict the relevant domains (super-peers), to answer a given query. Compared with a super peer-based approach, our proposal architectures show the effect of the data mining with better performance with respect to response time, number of messages, precision and recall.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6729-7; POD:978-1-4244-6728-0","10.1109/ICIW.2010.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476751","P2P;data mining;decision tree;routing queries","Data mining;Data models;Decision trees;Delay;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Search methods;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;decision trees;message passing;peer-to-peer computing;query processing;search problems","Gnutella;P2P network;data mining;decision tree;global-knowledge-super-peer;information retrieval;network traffic;peer-to-peer search method;query message","","1","","31","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PNO, which is made up of places and spatial relationships, can be viewed as the direct model of geographically named locations. It is based on mereology, topology, and location theory and it is built with OWL DL.

The Sensor planning service offers a standardized interface for the control of sensors and simulations. But some complex sensors like satellite need midterm or long-term action to response a given task, so, adding asynchronous support in SPS is necessary. The workflow description language can chain asynchronous web service together while it has to contend with the complex and specific communication mechanism of asynchronous SPS. In order to achieve asynchronous SPS, the Asynchronous Sensor Planning Service Chain (ASPSC) is proposed in this paper. The internal message exchange and external callback invocation method is used to serve dynamical retrieval service of satellite planning information under Sensor Web environment through the chaining of SPS operation. The proposed method has been successfully demonstrated in application scenarios for Simplified General Perturbations Satellite Orbit Model 4(SGP-4). It can service most near earth satellites and offers an automatic sensor information retrieval.

On the other hand, practical searching for information still confronts us with retrieval systems that are far from perfect. The purpose of this contribution is to clarify the practical state of the art of finding information through image web search systems in a particular subject domain and to derive recommendations from the outcome of the investigation. The method of investigation consisted of submitting queries to public access WWW image search engines followed by a quantitative evaluation of the 20 individual results that were ranked highest for each search query; the scoring method leads to a positive score related to precision between 0 and 20 and to a negative score related to misinformation between 0 and minus 20. This has lead to the following findings: Most positive scores were much lower than the ideal maximum, even though the queries contained very specific words and names as formulated by a user familiar with the subject domain. In other words, many image search results lead to information that is irrelevant, so that users lose time and may lose interest. Furthermore and worse, a significant number of search results may even mislead users who are unfamiliar with the selected subject domain. In conclusion, information retrieval from the WWW through image searching is attractive, simple and fast, but precision is far from perfect and users can be misinformed. Recommendations are formulated to authors, publishers, librarians and end-users of image information retrieval systems.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466942","Google;WWW;image searching;information literacy;information retrieval;misinformation;precision","Art;Image analysis;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Internet;Search engines;Text analysis;Web search;World Wide Web","Internet;image retrieval;search engines","Internet;WWW image searching;World Wide Web;information retrieval;scoring method;search engines;search query","","0","","21","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use the two trees to respectively model the structures of a region and its complement, which is called the Bipolar Model. We prune the two trees by removing the nodes with small protrusions. The leaf nodes of the pruned trees are interleaved to make a leaf chain. Two regions are compared and matched, using a cyclic edit distance between the two leaf chains, with restricted merge and split operations allowed.

This memory model is used to implement the associative level of a hierarchical heterogeneous knowledge-base model consisting of multi-levels, starting from an associative level, through to the semantic, rule-based and description-generator level as the top level in the hierarchy. The architecture of knowledge-base was inspired by biological and psychological models. The proposed algorithm retrieves concepts from the associative level based on the similarity between a concept of interest and already stored concepts. The similarity is expressed by a value of the linguistic variable. With this approach it is possible to solve a problem when the inference processes at the semantic level encounter an unknown concept of interest. The algorithm is demonstrated by retrieving concepts that were stored based on the results of psychological experiment.","","Electronic:978-9-5323-3050-2; POD:978-1-4244-7763-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5533510","","","inference mechanisms;information retrieval;knowledge based systems","Kanerva-like sparse distributed memory model;associative information retrieval algorithm;biological models;description-generator level;hierarchical heterogeneous knowledge-base model;inference process;knowledge-base system;psychological models;rule-based system","","0","","21","","","24-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A framework of intelligent retrieve based on semantic Web is proposed in this paper through researching the Semantic Web and analyzing the feature of traditional retrievals in Web. The design idea and process of the intelligent information retrieval system in detail are also described. It is provided in this framework that the unique identifier for every resource on World Wide Web and various types of links among resources which can be handled by computers.

In this paper we investigate the use of proxy-servers together with caching mechanisms to reduce network load and serve a large number of clients quickly within a lossy environment. A storage system is designed and implemented, coupled with intelligent mechanisms to store either the latest or most popular resources. The performance analysis results show that cached data can be accessed in a much shorter time as the overall system's data's transfer time and origin server's processing load decreases. We have also investigated the correlation of deletion algorithms with different client request patterns and conclude that when each file is not equally popular multiple proxy-servers can reduce the load on the server further.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5648-2; POD:978-1-4244-5647-5","10.1109/ICITST.2009.5402566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5402566","","Information retrieval","cache storage;information retrieval","cached data;client request pattern;client server model;deletion algorithm;information retrieval;intelligent mechanism;lossy environment;network load;online resources;proxy caching mechanism;service providers;storage system","","0","","9","","","9-12 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
