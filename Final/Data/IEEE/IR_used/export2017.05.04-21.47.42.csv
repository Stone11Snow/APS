It normally requires a good knowledge and experience in application development, database SQL, and may be some other fields to build a well-designed application. The inherited nature, which is common in most database-driven applications, is that SQL statements are considered to be part of the code. However, this technique, sometimes, leads to more development complexity and reduces the understandability of the code. In this paper we propose an SQL Statement Template. This template suggests a layer whereby SQL statements are externalized and defined in a uniform way. The template outcome is produced using a definition language, and clearly defined roles and responsibilities in the design and implementation phases.","","POD:0-7803-8819-4","10.1109/IRI.2004.1431429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431429","","Application software;Database languages;Database systems;Information retrieval;Navigation;Object oriented databases;Power system management;Prototypes;Publishing;Relational databases","SQL;relational databases;specification languages","SQL Statement Template;database-driven application;definition language","","0","1","4","","","8-10 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the research on declustering is targeted at spatial range queries and investigates schemes with low additive error. Recently, declustering using replication is proposed to reduce the additive overhead. Replication significantly reduces retrieval cost of arbitrary queries. In this paper, we propose a disk allocation and retrieval mechanism for arbitrary queries based on design theory. Using proposed c-copy replicated declustering scheme, (c - 1)k<sup>2</sup> + ck buckets can be retrieved using at most k disk accesses. Retrieval algorithm is very efficient and is asymptotically optimal with Î˜(|Q|) complexity for a query Q. In addition to the deterministic worst-case bound and efficient retrieval, proposed algorithm handles nonuniform data, high dimensions, supports incremental declustering and has good fault-tolerance property.","","POD:0-7695-2315-3","10.1109/ITCC.2005.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1428466","","Computer errors;Computer science;Costs;Data visualization;Delay;Fault tolerance;Information retrieval;Information systems;Spatial databases;Visual databases","computational complexity;database theory;fault tolerance;query processing;replicated databases;visual databases","c-copy replicated declustering;data distribution;design theory;deterministic worst-case bound;disk allocation;fault-tolerance;incremental declustering;nonuniform data;parallel I/O;query response time;retrieval algorithm;spatial range queries","","7","","20","","","4-6 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bayesian methods are used to take probabilistic information about reports of object detections and to incorporate this information into an information base, which includes probabilities of the location and probabilities for an object's existence. This allows for the discrimination of false/real objects, with the easy extension into false/real targets.

The problem of making new features on the larger time scale from the short-time features (feature integration) has received only little attention.

To satisfy their measurement objectives, many spaceborne passive sensors must operate in unprotected bands, and future sensors may also need to operate in unprotected bands. Data from these sensors are likely to be increasingly contaminated by RFI as the spectrum becomes more crowded. In a previous paper we reported on a preliminary investigation of RFI observed over the United States in the 6.9-GHz channels of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on the Earth Observing System Aqua satellite. Here, we extend the analysis to an investigation of RFI in the 6.9- and 10.7-GHz AMSR-E channels over the global land domain and for a one-year observation period. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the RFI are examined by the use of spectral indices. The observed RFI at 6.9 GHz is most densely concentrated in the United States, Japan, and the Middle East, and is sparser in Europe, while at 10.7 GHz the RFI is concentrated mostly in England, Italy, and Japan. Classification of RFI using means and standard deviations of the spectral indices is effective in identifying strong RFI. In many cases, however, it is difficult, using these indices, to distinguish weak RFI from natural geophysical variability. Geophysical retrievals using RFI-filtered data may therefore contain residual errors due to weak RFI. More robust radiometer designs and continued efforts to protect spectrum allocations will be needed in future to ensure the viability of spaceborne passive microwave sensing.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.837507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424270","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR);microwave radiometry;microwave remote sensing;radio-frequency interference (RFI)","Earth Observing System;Europe;Geophysical measurements;Information retrieval;Microwave radiometry;Pollution measurement;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency interference;Satellite broadcasting;Statistics","artificial satellites;geophysical techniques;microwave measurement;radiofrequency interference;radiometers;remote sensing","10.7 GHz;6.9 GHz;AMSR-E land observations;Earth Observing System Aqua satellite;advanced microwave scanning radiometer;geophysical retrievals;microwave radiometry;microwave remote sensing;natural geophysical variability;radio-frequency interference;robust radiometer designs;spaceborne passive microwave sensing;spaceborne passive sensors;spectral indices;spectrum allocations;unprotected bands","","150","","13","","","May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Rain cloud models are specified to characterize both nonraining clouds, stratiform and convective rainfall. Brightness temperature numerical simulations are performed for a set of frequencies from 20 to 60 GHz at zenith angle, representing the channels currently deployed on a commercially available ground-based radiometric system. Results are illustrated in terms of comparisons between measurements and model data in order to show that the observed radiometric signatures can be attributed to rainfall scattering and absorption. A new statistical inversion algorithm, trained by synthetic data and based on principal component analysis is also developed to classify the meteorological background, to identify the rain regime, and to retrieve rain rate from passive radiometric observations.

Based on the generative quasiharmonic model, a set of hypothetical partial sequences is derived and an optimal assignment of the observed peaks to the hypothetical sources and noise is performed. The hypothetical partial sequences are then evaluated by a score function which formulates the guiding principles in a mathematical manner.

Numerous shape descriptors have been proposed in the literature. These can be broadly categorized as region-based and contour-based descriptors. Contour-based shape descriptors make use of only the boundary information, ignoring the shape interior content. Therefore, these descriptors cannot represent shapes for which the complete boundary information is not available. On the other hand, region-based descriptors exploit both boundary and internal pixels, and therefore are applicable to generic shapes. Among the region-based descriptors, moments have been very popular since they were first introduced in the 60's. In this paper, we study and compare three moment-based descriptors: Invariant moments, Zernike moments, and radial Chebyshev moments. Experiments on the MPEG-7 shape databases show that radial Chebyshev moments achieve the highest retrieval performance.","","POD:0-7695-2315-3","10.1109/ITCC.2005.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1428560","","Chebyshev approximation;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Shape measurement;Spatial databases;Visual databases","Chebyshev approximation;Zernike polynomials;content-based retrieval;image representation;image retrieval;visual databases","MPEG-7 shape databases;Zernike moments;boundary information;content-based image retrieval paradigm;contour-based shape descriptors;internal pixels;invariant moments;radial Chebyshev moments;region-based shape descriptors;shape interior content;three moment-based shape descriptors","","27","","18","","","4-6 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the system architecture is generic to accommodate various uses, we have implemented a prototype for the remote screening of skin lesion images. Accordingly, the system incorporates content analysis modules such as a segmentation module, shape analyzers and a shape-feature based similarity computation module. The whole process is automated: clients use a Web interface to submit a query image, which goes through an automated analysis procedure and produces an interactive report containing similar images and a risk analysis report.

In this work, we describe the concept of group testing in a generalized framework and propose to apply this concept to solve the scheduling and multiple access problem in a large scale wireless sensor network. Since the standard approach is to dedicate a single channel to each sensor, we discuss the efficiency of group testing by comparing it to the case where each sensor is tested individually. Through the sequence of tests, the group testing strategy successively refines the observation space of the set of sensors and eventually identifies the status of each sensor when the space is refined to only one element. We show that the successive refinement property of group testing (similar to that of arithmetic coding) plays an important role in its performance. Based on this concept, we provide insight into choosing optimal group testing strategies for general applications.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:0-7803-8874-7","10.1109/ICASSP.2005.1415801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1415801","","Aggregates;Algorithm design and analysis;Blood;Distributed computing;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Testing;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;multi-access systems;multi-agent systems;scheduling;wireless sensor networks","distributed agents;distributed information retrieval;generalized group testing;large scale wireless sensor network;multiple access problem;performance;scheduling;successive refinement property","","2","","13","","","18-23 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here we introduce a new reasoning methodology, fuzzy-belief-state-based reasoning, to solve this problem. In this methodology, we first create a fuzzy-belief-state base for a system from its historical data. For any component n(n=1,...,N) of the set of empirical state vectors, the values of that component are clustered into Low, Medium and High fuzzy sets. Then each state vector is fuzzified into a fuzzy-belief-state vector of N triples, where the n-th triple contains the fuzzy truths of membership of the variable value in these respective three fuzzy sets. Each such vector of N triples is associated with a decision to form a fuzzy-belief-case and such cases comprise a fuzzy-belief-state base. Then, when given an observed state vector that is incomplete and uncertain, we mine fuzzy association rules from the fuzzy-belief-state base and apply them to infer the missing values and their fuzzy beliefs based on that incomplete observation. The completed observation is used to match fuzzy-belief-state vectors in the fuzzy-belief-state base. Decisions of the best matching cases are retrieved for use as in case-based reasoning.","","POD:0-7803-8819-4","10.1109/IRI.2004.1431519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431519","","Association rules;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data mining;Decision making;Fuzzy sets;Information retrieval;Pattern recognition;Resource management;Uncertainty","belief networks;case-based reasoning;computational complexity;decision making;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy systems;uncertainty handling","NP-hard algorithms;case-based reasoning;decision making;empirical state vectors;fuzzy association rules;fuzzy sets;fuzzy-belief-state-based reasoning;reasoning methodology","","1","","30","","","8-10 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By indexing the occurrences of MIS, we can efficiently locate the high-selective substructures of a query, improving search performance significantly. An efficient data mining algorithm is proposed, which finds the minimal infrequent structures. Their occurrences in the XML data are then indexed by a lightweight data structure and used as a fast filter step in query evaluation.

The topological processing of singular value decomposition (SVD), which compresses a large amount of co-occurrence information into a much smaller space, is similar to the common feature of feed-forward neural network systems where a large number of inputs are connected to a fairly small number of hidden layer nodes. Until now, the diagonal values by SVD have not been interpreted in full and the statistical step of hidden nodes depends only on the input. It is supposed that this study will provide the visual clues, which were described in the corpus, of the contraction-expansion homeostasis of the corpus network, and will help for actualizing the ambiguous axis in a space generated by SVD and characterizing the more efficient input-dependant steps of hidden nodes.","","POD:0-7803-8730-9","10.1109/IECON.2004.1432281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432281","","Art;Character generation;Computer networks;Feedforward neural networks;Feedforward systems;Frequency;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Physics computing;Statistics","feedforward neural nets;graph theory;singular value decomposition","SVD;co-occurrence;contraction-expansion homeostasis;corpus network;diagonal value;feed-forward neural network;hidden layer node;mathematical graph;singular value decomposition;topological processing","","0","","11","","","2-6 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A single-channel (85 GHz) empirically based algorithm using a neural network approach is presented. The objective is to correct the beam-filling error (BFE), that might occur because of the inherent variability within coarse microwave pixels, with subpixel information. To this aim, we used the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission passive microwave, thermal infrared and radar data. The integration of spatial information into the retrieval algorithm enables us to partially overcome the BFE. We use two parameters which characterize the horizontal cloud inhomogeneity within the microwave radiometer field of view, and we add them to simulated brightness temperatures as inputs of the neural network algorithm. The first one is the cloud fraction derived from infrared measurement, and the second corresponds to the fraction of the rainy area derived from radar measurements. The output rain rates were validated using the Precipitation Radar data. It was found that adding cloud fraction of microwave pixels, can lead to more accurate retrievals. Instantaneous precipitation estimates demonstrated correlations of âˆ¼0.6-0.7 and âˆ¼0.7-0.8 with radar-derived rain rates, for ocean and land retrievals respectively. In spite of the problem inherent in deriving the cloud (or rain) fraction, the initial validation results presented in this study are reasonably encouraging and show the advantage of utilizing the information from different sensors in order to optimize the retrieval of rainfall.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.843757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424283","Beam-filling error;Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM);infrared (IR);microwave measurements;neural network (NN);radar;rain;remote sensing","Clouds;Error correction;Information retrieval;Microwave measurements;Microwave radiometry;Neural networks;Passive radar;Radar measurements;Rain;Sea measurements","atmospheric techniques;clouds;microwave measurement;neural nets;rain;remote sensing by radar","85 GHz;Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission;beam-filling effect correction;beam-filling error;brightness temperatures;cloud inhomogeneity;microwave pixels;microwave radiometer;microwave rain rate retrievals;neural network;passive microwave measurement;precipitation radar;radar measurements;rain fraction;remote sensing;retrieval algorithm;subpixel cloud fraction;thermal infrared measurement","","2","","53","","","May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, we focused on how the term feature and the co-link of Web documents affect clustering performance. We clustered Web documents by native term feature, co-link and both, and compared the output results with the originally allocated category. And we selected term features for each category using X<sup>2</sup>, information gain (IG), and mutual information (MI) from training documents, and applied these features to other experimental documents. In addition we suggested a new method named max feature selection, which selects terms that have the maximum count for a category in each experimental document, and applied X<sup>2</sup> (or MI or IG) values to each term instead of term frequency of documents, and clustered them. In the results, X<sup>2</sup> shows a better performance than IG or MI, but the difference appears to be slight. But when we applied the max feature selection method, the clustering performance improved notably. Max feature selection is a simple but effective means of feature space reduction and shows powerful performance for Korean Web document clustering.","","POD:0-7803-8730-9","10.1109/IECON.2004.1432224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432224","","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Data mining;Explosions;Frequency;Information retrieval;Information science;Internet;Libraries;Mutual information","Internet;document handling;feature extraction;information retrieval;pattern clustering","Korean Web document clustering;feature selection method;feature space reduction;information gain;max feature selection;mutual information","","0","","10","","","2-6 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we have proposed an adaptive hashing scheme that works on dynamic key sets and still enables keys to be searched in constant time.

In the image retrieval stage, the similarity between a query image and a target image will contain not only direct region correspondence but also the mutual relationships between connected color regions.

The proposed approach is based on the multivariate Wald-Wolfowitz test, a nonparametric test that assesses the commonality between two different sets of multivariate observations. It provides an aggregate gauge of the match between color images, taking into consideration all the (selected) low-level characteristics, while alleviating correspondence issues. We show that a powerful measure of similarity between two color images can emerge from the statistical comparison of their representations in a properly formed feature space. For the sake of simplicity, the RGB-space is selected as the feature space, while we are experimenting with different ways to represent the images within this space. By altering the feature-extraction implementation, complementary ways to portray the image content appear. The reported results, from the application on a diverse collection of images, clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, its superiority over previous methods, and suggest that even further improvements can be achieved along the same line of research. It is not only the unifying character that makes our strategy appealing, but also the fact that the retrieval performance does not increase continuously with the amount of details in the image representation. The latter sets an upper limit to the computational demands and reminds of performance plateaus reached by novel approaches in information retrieval.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423981","Index Terms- Image retrieval;graph-theoretic methods;multivariate statistics;multivariate visualization.;sampling;similarity measures","Aggregates;Color;Distortion measurement;Extraterrestrial measurements;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Statistics;Testing","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;graph theory;image colour analysis;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;information retrieval;sampling methods;visual databases","color image retrieval;feature-extraction implementation;graph-theoretic methods;image representation;information retrieval;multivariate Wald-Wolfowitz test;multivariate statistics;multivariate visualization;sampling methods;similarity measures;statistical comparison","","25","","44","","","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The phase unbalance index of distribution feeders is calculated based on the phasing current magnitude of each line segment and branch, which has been solved by a three-phase load flow program. The database of an automated mapping/facility management (AM/FM) system is used to retrieve the component attributes, and the topology process is executed to determine the electrical network configuration and the customers served by each distribution transformer. By using the monthly energy consumption of customers in customer information system (CIS) and the typical daily load patterns of customer classes, the hourly loading profiles of distribution transformers and service zones can be derived to solve the individual phase loadings of each primary feeder and lateral. The phase balancing of distribution systems is enhanced by heuristic rule-based searching process to minimize the phase unbalance index. To demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed methodology, a practical distribution feeder with 2754 customers is selected for computer simulation to enhance three-phase balancing of distribution systems. It is concluded that three-phase balancing of distribution systems can be obtained by considering customer load characteristics.","0885-8950;08858950","","10.1109/TPWRS.2005.846077","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425564","Automated mapping/facility management (AM/FM);customer information system (CIS);customer load pattern;node reduction;topology process","Chaos;Computational Intelligence Society;Computer simulation;Databases;Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Load flow;Management information systems;Network topology","distribution networks;load flow;power consumption;power engineering computing;power transformers","backtracking search algorithm;computer simulation;customer information system;customer load patterns;distribution feeders;distribution systems;distribution transformer;electrical network configuration;heuristic rule-based phase balancing;rule-based searching process;three-phase load flow program;topology process","","12","","13","","","May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The basic idea of the new algorithm is that the constituent segments of the images are used to retrieve images within a digital library. Image retrieval using segments is distinctive in that the local features of the image are used to retrieve the image instead of the typically utilized global features. In our algorithm, the given image is first segmented into dominant components and then the features of these components are extracted to perform retrieval. The features corresponding to each component are used to calculate the distance between components in the matching process. Each image is ranked based on the component wise distance measure with respect to the query component. One of the advantages of the algorithm is that, for a given retrieval image, the user can select a query segment with which to perform retrieval, thus it can satisfy different needs from different users.","","POD:0-9744559-0-3","10.1109/SIEDS.2003.158037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1242432","","Color;Content based retrieval;Gray-scale;Image converters;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Image storage;Information retrieval;Shape","content-based retrieval;digital libraries;feature extraction;image retrieval;image segmentation;visual databases","component distance measure;digital library;feature extraction;image classification algorithm;image database;image retrieval;image segmentation;query component","","3","1","9","","","24-25 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of these benefits is the ability to take advantage of semantic relationships among concepts in finding relevant documents. Another benefit is the elimination of irrelevant documents by identifying conceptual mismatches. Concepts are mental structures. Words and phrases are the linguistic representatives of concepts. Due to the inherent conciseness of natural language, words can represent multiple concepts and different words may represent the same or very similar concepts. Word sense disambiguation attempts to resolve this ambiguity using contextual information. The use of an ontology facilitates identification of related concepts and their linguistic representatives given a key concept. Latent semantic analysis, on the other hand, attempts to reveal the hidden conceptual relationships among words and phrases based on linguistic usage patterns. In this work we explore the potential of concept-based information access via these two methods.

As operator execution demands high computation capability, we propose the use of a heterogenous sensor network where query operators are assigned to sparsely deployed resource-rich nodes within a dense network of low power sensor nodes. We design an adaptive, decentralized, low communication overhead algorithm to determine an operator placement on the resource-rich nodes in the network to minimize cost of transmitting data along a routing tree constructed to retrieve data continuously at the sink from a set of spatially distributed geographical regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build an energy aware routing infrastructure to enable in-network processing of spatio-temporal queries.","1525-3511;15253511","POD:0-7803-8966-2","10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424795","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Costs;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Query processing;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","minimisation;monitoring;power consumption;query processing;telecommunication network routing;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","data transmission cost minimization;distributed query processing;energy aware routing;energy consumption;query operators;query trees;routing tree;spatio-temporal data monitoring;spatio-temporal queries;wireless sensor networks","","11","","12","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the system, not only the instructor can be relieved from the load of answering lots of questions, but also the student can mostly get answers promptly without waiting for the instructor to get online and provide an answer. This would be a big help for both the instructor and the student in e-learning environment. Through the process of raising questions and getting answers, the knowledge base will be enriched for future questions answering. Further, not only the students can get answers for their questions, but also the instructors could know what problems students encounter in learning.

"Fast similarity search and clustering of video sequences on the world-wide-web","S. S. Cheung; A. Zakhor","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","20050516","2005","7","3","524","537","We define similar video content as video sequences with almost identical content but possibly compressed at different qualities, reformatted to different sizes and frame-rates, undergone minor editing in either spatial or temporal domain, or summarized into keyframe sequences. Building a search engine to identify such similar content in the World-Wide Web requires: 1) robust video similarity measurements; 2) fast similarity search techniques on large databases; and 3) intuitive organization of search results. In a previous paper, we proposed a randomized technique called the video signature (ViSig) method for video similarity measurement. In this paper, we focus on the remaining two issues by proposing a feature extraction scheme for fast similarity search, and a clustering algorithm for identification of similar clusters. Similar to many other content-based methods, the ViSig method uses high-dimensional feature vectors to represent video. To warrant a fast response time for similarity searches on high dimensional vectors, we propose a novel nonlinear feature extraction scheme on arbitrary metric spaces that combines the triangle inequality with the classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We show experimentally that the proposed technique outperforms PCA, Fastmap, Triangle-Inequality Pruning, and Haar wavelet on signature data. To further improve retrieval performance, and provide better organization of similarity search results, we introduce a new graph-theoretical clustering algorithm on large databases of signatures. This algorithm treats all signatures as an abstract threshold graph, where the distance threshold is determined based on local data statistics. Similar clusters are then identified as highly connected regions in the graph. By measuring the retrieval performance against a ground-truth set, we show that our proposed algorithm outperforms simple thresholding, single-link and complete-link hierarchical clustering techniques.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2005.846906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1430728","Clustering;dimension reduction;similarity search;video signature;web search","Clustering algorithms;Delay;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Search engines;Spatial databases;Video compression;Video sequences","Internet;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;fractals;graph theory;image retrieval;multimedia databases;pattern clustering;principal component analysis;search engines;very large databases;video coding;video databases","PCA;World-Wide-Web;feature extraction scheme;large databases;principal component analysis;search engine;threshold graph-theoretical clustering algorithm;triangle inequality;video content-based methods;video sequences;video signature;video similarity search","","37","3","31","","","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because of this, mobile databases are greatly increasing in popularity. Using mobile devices, users can access and modify information without a network connection, and can then synchronize any updates when they get connected. This synchronization process must not only be able to perform updates on data from multiple users, but must also be able to detect and resolve conflicts. This process can sometimes be expensive and the synchronization algorithm must not only be robust, but also efficient. Motivated by this, we present DeferredSync as a new efficient XML based synchronization technique. DeferredSync converts relational data into XML tree structure and then makes use of deferred views in order to minimize bandwidth and storage space for the client. Finally, a conflict detection and resolution algorithm using priority selection to synchronize the data is outlined.","","POD:0-7803-8819-4","10.1109/IRI.2004.1431458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431458","","Bandwidth;Computer science;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Relational databases;Robustness;Scheduling;Transaction databases;Tree data structures;XML","XML;data visualisation;distributed databases;relational databases;synchronisation;tree data structures","DeferredSync XML based synchronization technique;XML tree structure;conflict detection algorithm;conflict resolution algorithm;deferred views;materialized views;mobile XML database synchronization;relational data","","2","46","11","","","8-10 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on a novel spectral characterization of a DAG, this topological signature allows us to efficiently retrieve a promising set of candidates from a database of models using a simple nearest-neighbor search. We establish the insensitivity of the signature to minor perturbation of graph structure due to noise, occlusion, or node split/merge. To accommodate large-scale occlusion, the DAG rooted at each nonleaf node of the query ""votes"" for model objects that share that ""part,"" effectively accumulating local evidence in a model DAG's topological subspaces.

In this paper, we describe three approaches for joint classification and segmentation based on HMM, which search for the most likely class transition path by using the dynamic programming technique. All these approaches utilize audio and visual information simultaneously. The first two approaches search optimal scene class transition based on the likelihood values computed for short video segment belonging to a particular class but with different search constrains.

This technique is very helpful for searching those areas of interest where chances of misspelling are more likely, for example retrieving text information from an image. The technique we propose can be used as an embedded component or a post-processing tool for image analysis resulting in a faster retrieval of corresponding information from images with given keywords. In the case of no hits, our technique outcome would suggest few close matches that can be further searched in keywords to get a closer match with improved speed of searching.","1550-5219;15505219","POD:0-7695-2250-5","10.1109/AIPR.2004.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1409682","","Decoding;Hamming distance;Image analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Pattern matching;Pattern recognition;Spatial databases;Text analysis","fuzzy systems;image matching;information retrieval;text analysis","fuzzy find matching tool;image text analysis;keywords;post-processing tool;textual information retrieval","","1","","9","","","13-15 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Implications of executing compression and encryption applications on general purpose processors","B. K. Lee; L. K. John","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Texas Univ., Austin, TX, USA","IEEE Transactions on Computers","20050523","2005","54","7","917","922","Compression and encryption applications are important components of modern multimedia workloads. These workloads are typically executed on application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), application specific processors (ASPs), or general purpose processors (GPPs). GPPs are flexible and allow changes in the applications and algorithms better than ASICs and ASPs. However, executing these applications on GPPs is done at a high cost. In this paper, we analyze media compression and encryption applications from the perspective of executing them on a programmable general purpose processor versus ASPs. We select 12 programs from various types of compression and encryption applications. The instruction mix, data types of memory operations, and memory access workloads during the execution of these programs are analyzed. Most of these applications involve processing the data through execution phases (e.g., quantization, encoding, etc.) and temporary results are stored and retrieved between these phases. A metric called overhead memory-access bandwidth per input and output byte is defined to characterize the temporary storage and retrieval of data during execution. We observe that more than 90 percent of the memory accesses made by these programs are temporary data stores and loads arising from the general purpose nature of the execution platform. We also verify the robustness of the proposed metric on different experimental environments using various input data properties and compiler optimizations.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2005.121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432674","Index Terms- Media compression;MediaZip benchmark;decoding;decryption;encoding;encryption;memory behavior;overhead memory bandwidth.;workload characterization","Application specific integrated circuits;Application specific processors;Bandwidth;Costs;Cryptography;Encoding;Information retrieval;Optimizing compilers;Quantization;Robustness","cryptography;data compression;memory architecture","MediaZip benchmark;decoding;decryption;encoding;encryption;media compression;memory access workload;overhead memory-access bandwidth;programmable general purpose processor","","1","1","21","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
