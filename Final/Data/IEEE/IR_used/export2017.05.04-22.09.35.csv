The CAM consumes more power due to parallel search operation and the designing issues of the CAM are to reduce the power consumption, area and to improve performance. The proposed architecture is based on a recently developed sparse clustered network which eliminates most of the parallel comparisons performed during a search operation. In order to reduce power in search operation NAND type CAM is used in which the CAM cell is XNOR type. For best search performance the NOR type CAM is used which is XOR type. Today the challenging issue is to reduce area and power consumption in CAM. The existing CAM cell is made of 10T and 9T.

Recently, hashing methods are used for fast nearest neighbor search in large-scale data spaces, by embedding high-dimensional feature descriptors into a similarity preserving Hamming space with a low dimension. Inspired by this, in this paper, we introduce a novel supervised cross-modality hashing framework, which can generate unified binary codes for instances represented in different modalities. Particularly, in the learning phase, each bit of a code can be sequentially learned with a discrete optimization scheme that jointly minimizes its empirical loss based on a boosting strategy. In a bitwise manner, hash functions are then learned for each modality, mapping the corresponding representations into unified hash codes. We regard this approach as cross-modality sequential discrete hashing (CSDH), which can effectively reduce the quantization errors arisen in the oversimplified rounding-off step and thus lead to high-quality binary codes. In the test phase, a simple fusion scheme is utilized to generate a unified hash code for final retrieval by merging the predicted hashing results of an unseen instance from different modalities. The proposed CSDH has been systematically evaluated on three standard data sets: Wiki, MIRFlickr, and NUS-WIDE, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art multimodality hashing techniques.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2619262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7600368","Cross-modality retrieval;bitwise;discrete optimization;hashing;unified hash code","Binary codes;Boosting;Data structures;Electronic mail;Optimization;Quantization (signal);Semantics","Internet;binary codes;data handling;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation","CSDH;Internet;MIRFlickr data sets;NUS-WIDE data sets;Wiki data sets;boosting strategy;cross-modality sequential discrete hashing;discrete optimization scheme;empirical loss minimization;high-dimensional feature descriptors;high-quality binary codes;large-scale data spaces;large-scale retrieval;multimodal Web data;nearest neighbor search;quantization errors reduction;scalable cross-modality similarity retrieval;sequential learning;similarity preserving Hamming space;supervised cross-modality hashing framework;unified binary codes;unified hash codes","","1","","","","20161019","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a new method to detect formulas in text lines captured by cell phone in natural conditions for online Chinese examination question retrieval. First, we use the stroke width transform algorithm to get the initial text lines. Second, we take an improved measure to merge these initially scattered text lines into principal text lines, which can be used for the following operation. Next, characters in the text lines are segmented by projection method and marked as Chinese character or non-Chinese-character automatically by some features. If the neighboring characters match the limit conditions, they will be detected as a formula and be extracted. Since some formulas are higher than the localized text lines which they belong to, an extension operation will be done to the extracted formula in the vertical direction to get the complete formula. We tested our method on some data sets, and the result shows that our method is satisfactory for various subjects.","","","10.1109/DMIAF.2016.7574920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7574920","","Algorithm design and analysis;Cellular phones;Education;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Merging;Transforms","computer aided instruction;image recognition;image retrieval;image segmentation;natural language processing;question answering (information retrieval);text detection","cell phone;extension operation;formula detection;image recognition;image retrieval system;initially scattered text line merging;localized text lines;online Chinese examination question retrieval;principal text lines;projection method;stroke width transform;text line segmentation","","","","","","","4-6 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Learning a dual-language vector space for domain-specific cross-lingual question retrieval","G. Chen; C. Chen; Z. Xing; B. Xu","School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","2016 31st IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)","20161006","2016","","","744","755","The lingual barrier limits the ability of millions of non-English speaking developers to make effective use of the tremendous knowledge in Stack Overflow, which is archived in English. For cross-lingual question retrieval, one may use translation-based methods that first translate the non-English queries into English and then perform monolingual question retrieval in English. However, translation-based methods suffer from semantic deviation due to inappropriate translation, especially for domain-specific terms, and lexical gap between queries and questions that share few words in common. To overcome the above issues, we propose a novel cross-lingual question retrieval based on word embed-dings and convolutional neural network (CNN) which are the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to capture word- and sentence-level semantics. The CNN model is trained with large amounts of examples from Stack Overflow duplicate questions and their corresponding translation by machine, which guides the CNN to learn to capture informative word and sentence features to recognize and quantify semantic similarity in the presence of semantic deviations and lexical gaps. A uniqueness of our approach is that the trained CNN can map documents in two languages (e.g., Chinese queries and English questions) in a dual-language vector space, and thus reduce the cross-lingual question retrieval problem to a simple k-nearest neighbors search problem in the dual-language vector space, where no query or question translation is required. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms the translation-based method, and can be extended to dual-language documents retrieval from different sources.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7582810","Convolutional Neural Network;Cross-lingual question retrieval;Dual-Language Vector Space;Word embeddings","Context;Convolution;Google;Inspection;Neural networks;Predictive models;Semantics","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;query processing;question answering (information retrieval);search problems;text analysis","CNN model training;Chinese queries;English questions;Stack Overflow;convolutional neural network;deep learning technique;document mapping;domain-specific cross-lingual question retrieval;domain-specific terms;dual-language document retrieval;dual-language vector space;k-nearest neighbor search problem;lexical gap;lingual barrier;machine translation;monolingual question retrieval;nonEnglish speaking developers;semantic deviation;semantic similarity;sentence-level semantics capture;translation-based method;word embeddings;word-level semantics capture","","","","","","","3-7 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, each company stores the data to the closed server and blocks the access so that the data is available only inside the respective data silos. Because of these reasons, it is hard to combine various data to provide integrated information service. To solve the problems, we propose two solutions. 1) Define events of the car life cycle, and data models for data sharing. 2) Establish open system for data sharing and service registration based on GS1 standard.

We employed a wearable eye tracker instead of a remote desk-mounted eye tracker. Due to their mobility and flexibility, this technology has been selected to simulate real-world environment while reading printed documents. Data acquired by a wearable head-mounted eye trackers is based on the gaze position with respect to the video recorded by the embedded camera. Hence, the coordinate of the gaze must be mapped to the corresponding document so that it enables us to investigate eye tracking data analysis techniques. In order to perform this task, we adopted a robust document retrieval technique called Locally Likely Arrangement Hashing (LLAH) to our data. Briefly, the scenario of the process is as follows: First, participants read the print-out scientific papers with the eye tracker. Then, gaze data maps to the corresponding original document in our retrieval database. Finally, the gaze analysis system extracts the intended information for statistical evaluation.

In this paper, the goal is not to propose new efficient algorithms but a new data structure that could be used by a variety of existing algorithms without modifying its original schema. Thus, our aim is to speed up the association rule mining process regardless the algorithm used to this end, enabling the performance of efficient implementations to be enhanced. The structure simplifies, reorganizes, and speeds up the data access by sorting data by means of a shuffling strategy based on the hamming distance, which achieve similar values to be closer, and considering both an inverted index mapping and a run length encoding compression. In the experimental study, we explore the bounds of the algorithms' performance by using a wide number of data sets that comprise either thousands or millions of both items and records.

Recently, how to generate Hashcode for multimodal data (e.g., images with textual tags, documents with photos, and so on) for large-scale cross-modality search (e.g., searching semantically related images in database for a document query) is an important research issue because of the fast growth of multimodal data in the Web. To address this issue, a novel framework for multimodal Hashing is proposed, termed as Collective Matrix Factorization Hashing (CMFH). The key idea of CMFH is to learn unified Hashcodes for different modalities of one multimodal instance in the shared latent semantic space in which different modalities can be effectively connected. Therefore, accurate cross-modality search is supported. Based on the general framework, we extend it in the unsupervised scenario where it tries to preserve the Euclidean structure, and in the supervised scenario where it fully exploits the label information of data. The corresponding theoretical analysis and the optimization algorithms are given. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three benchmark data sets for cross-modality search. The experimental results demonstrate that CMFH can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art cross-modality Hashing methods, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed CMFH.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2607421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7563341","Hashing;collective matrix factorization;cross-modality search;multimodal data;optimization;scalability","Algorithm design and analysis;Binary codes;Databases;Hamming distance;Matrix decomposition;Optimization;Semantics","information retrieval;matrix decomposition;multimedia databases","binary representation;collective matrix factorization hashing;large-scale cross-modality search;shared latent semantic space","","1","","","","20160908","Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Initially, the domain of interest is presented at some level of abstraction by partitioning the domain to a number of subject areas. Next each expert is represented by a vector of contributions of the expert to the different areas. This defines an overlapping partition, which is further analyzed and refined into a disjoint one by applying Formal Concept Analysis. In this way a hierarchical conceptual structure is automatically derived. It consists of concepts where each one represents a subset of experts belonging to a number of subject areas. The set of all derived concepts partitions the experts into a set of disjoint expert areas.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1354-8; POD:978-1-5090-1355-5; USB:978-1-5090-1353-1","10.1109/IS.2016.7737462","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737462","data mining;expert finding;formal concept analysis;health science;knowledge management","Context;Data mining;Electronic mail;Formal concept analysis;Lattices;LinkedIn;Semantics","data mining;formal concept analysis;information retrieval;pattern clustering","data mining;domain partitioning;expert finding;expertise retrieval;experts clustering;formal concept analysis;hierarchical conceptual structure;information retrieval;overlapping partition;subject experts identification","","","","","","","4-6 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These data contain rich knowledge on the user's social interactions in communities, geographical mobility patterns between regions, categorical preferences on activities, aspect interests in topics, and opinion expressions for sentiments. Such knowledge is essential for two key applications, namely, text sentiment classification and venue recommendations, which will be developed in this paper. To extract the knowledge from the data, the key task is to discover the latent communities, regions, activities, topics, and sentiments of users. However, these latent variables are interdependent, e.g., users in the same community usually travel on nearby regions and share common activities and topics, which renders a big challenge for modeling these latent variables. To tackle this challenge, in this study, we propose an LDA-based model called CRATS that jointly mines the latent Communities, Regions, Activities, Topics, and Sentiments based on the important dependencies among these latent variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to jointly model these five latent variables. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for CRATS in different applications, including text sentiment classification and venue recommendations, using three large-scale real-world geosocial network data sets collected from Yelp and Foursquare.

Graph Database is a collection of operational data objects, mapped into huge labeled graph or a set of labeled directed graphs. In recent years, modeling data in graph structure becomes evident and effective for processing in some of the prominent application area like social analytics etc. Graph databases are mapped into data graphs for further computing or processing. Graphs are one of the dominant data modeling tool used in many application areas. Hence, there is a demand for proficient querying techniques on such large data graphs. The user query is mapped into pattern graph, which is constructed by connecting nodes based on links/relationships required by user. The primary objective of graph pattern matching (GPM) is to determine all the candidates matching to a pattern query in a large data graph. This survey paper discusses various graph pattern matching approaches, used by researchers in recent year for query processing. Further, we also highlight the various challenges imposed by modern day computing and possible future research directions in query processing using graph pattern matching.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7724255","Big Data Analytics;Graph Data;Graph Mining;Graph Pattern Matching;Query Processing","Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Data models;Pattern matching;Query processing;Semantics","Internet;database management systems;directed graphs;information retrieval systems;pattern matching;query processing","GPM;Internet;data archives;data modeling tool;directed graphs;graph pattern matching;graph-structured database;large data graphs;operational data objects;query processing","","","","","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our framework, word embeddings with biomedical meanings are trained for query expansion. Then, the expansion query is used to retrieve the relevant snippets from the candidate documents using the sequential dependence model which can benefit retrieval results.

Among the existing web content extraction methods, density based content extraction is one popular method. However density based methods, suffer from poor efficiency, especially when the pages containing less information and long noise. We propose a web content extraction technique build on Entropy based Informative Content Density algorithm (EICD). The proposed EICD algorithm initially analyses higher text density content. Further, the entropy-based analysis is performed for selected features. The key idea of EICD is to utilize the information entropy for representing the knowledge that correlates to the amount of informative content in a page.

Different from the previous MCMC method that solves the problem via simulating surfing the internet forward, we adopt MCMC method to solve PageRank problem via simulating surfing the internet backward, called reverse PageRank. For a selected page, the MCMC method can be used to simulate the network to find all the possible paths from any other page to the selected page. The major advantage of the proposed method is that only one page is evaluated, instead of computing the whole pages. Following this method, we can independently evaluate the importance of the selected page. As MCMC method has parallelism and robustness in nature, it is suitable to be implemented and optimized on GPU. We have simulated the real world networks to evaluate the performance of the method. The results demonstrate that our MCMC method can be implemented efficiently on GPU and outperforms the other existing methods when few pages are evaluated.

The proposed methodology is aimed to address both the urgent demand of off-line (or historic) LC information retrieval and of near-real time LC monitoring. The discrete-time model employs short steps of 16 days, that conveniently fits the Landsat revisit time while providing a continuous and temporally dense representation of the land cover dynamics. Two temporal pattern typologies were identified and modeled within the proposed Markov chain architecture: a seasonal and synchrounous behavior which can be associated to the observables of LC classes such as forest and grasses, and a highly asynchronous behaviour, which characterizes the crop observables. The first typology is addressed by introducing time-dependency in state output probabilities, whereas the latter is rendered through a sequence of (sub-class) states interlinked by means of a `left-right' based model. Such model inherently incorporates crop growth tracking functionalities as an added value.

SLSH further accelerates the sublinear retrieval time obtained by the standard locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method. The standard family of locality-sensitive hash functions is limited to provide only a single perspective on the data due to its one-to-one relationship to a distinct distance function for measuring similarity. SLSH incorporates multiple locality-sensitive hash families with various distance functions enabling it to examine the data with more diverse and refined perspectives. We provide the procedures of SLSH with locality-sensitive hash families for the l<sub>1</sub> and the cosine distances, and compare its performance to the standard LSH on an arterial blood pressure time series data extracted from the physiological waveform repository of the MIMIC2 database. The time to retrieve five most similar waveforms by SLSH is 14 times faster than the linear search and 1.7 times faster than the standard LSH when we allow 5% decrease in accuracy as a trade-off.","1557-170X;1557170X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0220-4; POD:978-1-4577-0219-8","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7591233","","Acceleration;Arterial blood pressure;MIMICs;Physiology;Shape;Standards;Time series analysis","blood pressure measurement;file organisation;information retrieval;medical information systems;time series","MIMIC2 database;accelerated physiological time series retrieval;arterial blood pressure time series data;locality-sensitive hash families;physiological waveform repository;stratified locality-sensitive hashing method","","","","","","","16-20 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At present, most searches on semantics focused on semantic relatedness computing rather than semantic clues discovering. To discover semantic clues, we propose a novel semantic clues discovering method, named as Semantic Pheromone Walking (SPW) that utilizes the strategies of pheromone in ant colony algorithm and random walk algorithm to discover close semantic clues among knowledge entities. Our proposed SPW comprises two aspects: concept network construction and semantic clue discovering. Firstly, constructing a weighted network model named Concept Network (CN), the link weights of which are determined in accordance with the hyperlink structure and semantic relatedness of text data in ODKN contains abundant semantic information. Then, a concept network based Semantic Pheromone Walking method is addressed to discover semantic clues between knowledge entities by using Semantic Pheromone (SP) which is a digital signal reflecting the compactness of concept correlation, as heuristic information. Finally, the experimental results show that: the human cognitive information contained in the knowledge network can meet the need of the exploration of correlation form between things and our solution could find reasonable semantic clues based it.","","","10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7603880","Semantic clue;pheromone;random walk;semantic intensity;semantic relatedness","Cognition;Correlation;Dictionaries;Knowledge engineering;Legged locomotion;Reliability;Semantics","ant colony optimisation;data mining;information retrieval;random processes","ODKN;SPW;ant colony algorithm;concept correlation;concept network construction;concept relatedness;decision making;human cognitive information;hyperlink structure;information retrieval;knowledge entities;knowledge reasoning;open domain knowledge network;random walk algorithm;semantic clue discovering scheme;semantic pheromone walking;text data semantic relatedness;weighted network model","","","","","","","5-7 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that it is possible to extract more information and infer integer states from the same slots in RFID communications. We propose a joint estimator that optimally combines multiple sub-estimators, each of which independently counts the number of tags with different inferred PHY states.

Attendance management matches the student's identity and locates his/her profile. T&S communication provides an additional channel of Question and Answer (Q&A) between a teacher and students. VFOA recognition captures student's attention on different learning targets based on the estimated head poses, visual environment cues and prior state in class.

NDN rethinks the Internet communication paradigm around the name of the data instead of its location. In Content-Oriented architectures, in-network caching enables data retrieval from different network nodes and may result in frequent data sources changes and wide RTT fluctuations during a flow. Since NDN architectures use Interest retransmission timer at the scale of network RTT estimations, this would generate erroneously premature timeouts events resulting in unnecessary Interests retransmission. In this paper, we tackle the Interest retransmission problem. We first analyze the impact of temporary caches on the number of timeouts events. Then we introduce “Source Change Notification” to address this issue. A preliminary evaluation has been conducted by means of the ndnSIM simulator.

The first part of this paper explores illicit and criminal content identified by prominent researchers in the dark web. We previously developed a web crawler that automatically searched websites on the internet based on pre-defined keywords and followed the hyperlinks in order to create a map of the network. This crawler has demonstrated previous success in locating and extracting data on child exploitation images, videos, keywords and linkages on the public internet. However, as Tor functions differently at the TCP level, and uses socket connections, further technical challenges are faced when crawling Tor. Some of the other inherent challenges for advanced Tor crawling include scalability, content selection tradeoffs, and social obligation. We discuss these challenges and the measures taken to meet them. Our modified web crawler for Tor, termed the “Dark Crawler” has been able to access Tor while simultaneously accessing the public internet. We present initial findings regarding what extremist and terrorist contents are present in Tor and how this content is connected to each other in a mapped network that facilitates dark web crimes.

In this regard, the use of network models of data structure is required. In this paper, we present an ontological model for an information system for storning educational information.

The existing works about keyword search on databases proposed many approaches and have gain remarkable results. However, most of these approaches are designed for the centralized setting where keyword search is processed by only a single server. In reality, the scale of databases increases sharply and centralized methods hardly can handle keyword queries over these large databases. Moreover, processing keyword search over relational databases is a very time-consuming task, and the efficiency of the existing centralized approaches will degrade notably because the single server cannot provide enough computation power for the keyword search over very large databases. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed keyword search (DKS) approach with MapReduce and this approach can be well deployed on a cluster of servers to deal with keyword search over large databases in a parallel way.","","","10.1109/BigDataCongress.2016.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7584961","Distributed;Keyword search;MapReduce;data graph","Distributed databases;Keyword search;Relational databases;Search problems;Servers;Steiner trees","information retrieval;parallel processing;relational databases;very large databases","DKS approach;MapReduce;centralized methods;database scale;distributed top-k keyword search;server cluster;very large databases","","","","","","","June 27 2016-July 2 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different weight means different concern degree to each subject term by user. To emphasize the quality of recommended literature, we not only calculate the similarity between user's research interest and literatures, but also consider the total times cited of recommended literatures.

In this paper, we propose a novel attention method based on a function between neuron activities, which we term a “match function”, which is augmented by a recursive softmax function. We evaluate the algorithm on the bAbI question answering dataset and show that it has stronger performance when only one memory hop is used in both terms of average score and in terms the number of solved questions. Furthermore, with three memory hops, our algorithm can solve 12/20 benchmark questions using 1000 training samples per task.

Although many properties of the trends are common across different domains, others are domain-specific. In particular, modelling human activities such as their behaviour on social media, often leads to sharply defined events separated by periods without events. This paper is motivated by time series representing the number of tweets per day addressed to a specific Twitter user. Such time series are characterized by the combination of (1) an underlying trend, (2) concentrated bursts of activity that can be arbitrarily large, often attributable to an event, e.g., a tweet that goes viral or a real-world event, and (3) random fluctuations/noise. We present a new probabilistic model that accurately models such time series in terms of peaks on top of a piece-wise exponential trend. Fitting this model can be done by solving an efficient convex optimization problem. As an empirical validation of the approach, we illustrate how this model performs on a set of Twitter time series, each one addressing a particular music artist, which we manually annotated with events as a reference.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0746-2; POD:978-1-5090-0747-9","10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738815","Trend detection;convexity;time series","Graphical models;Market research;Maximum likelihood estimation;Probabilistic logic;Time measurement;Time series analysis;Twitter","convex programming;information retrieval;music;probability;random noise;social networking (online);time series","Twitter time series;convex optimization;human activities;music artist;piece-wise exponential trend;probabilistic model;random fluctuations;random noise;trend detection","","","","","","","13-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Systematization process aims to reform proper flawless question from the erroneous input question by removing existing errors present in order of words, word spelling and removing ambiguous synonyms of the words. This work deals with domain specific WH-questions of English language. Additionally it also works on imperative questions. Template based approach is supported with a key concept of `Question Templates' which are designed with human intelligence keeping detail knowledge of various lingual constructs, their grammar and domain specific questionnaire. This work is useful in various fields, for example in academics to set question papers, to assist English learners, to produce intermediate output for complex systems like question-answering system to retrieve correct answer from a huge dataset.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7724676","POS tagger;WH-questions;question templates;systematization;template based approach","Conferences;Decision support systems;Handheld computers","natural language processing;question answering (information retrieval)","English language;English learners;NLP technique;POS tagging technique;complex systems;dictionary approach;domain specific questionnaire;maximum entropy;question systematization;question-answering system;systematic question formation;template based approach","","","","","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Website links turn purple after we visit them, for example, showing us information we have yet to explore. These “footprints” of interaction offer substantial benefits in information saturated environments - they enable us to easily revisit old information, systematically explore new information, and quickly resume tasks after interruption. While applying these design principles have been successful in HCI contexts, direct encodings of personal interaction history have received scarce attention in data visualization. One reason is that there is little guidance for integrating history into visualizations where many visual channels are already occupied by data. More importantly, there is not firm evidence that making users aware of their interaction history results in benefits with regards to exploration or insights. Following these observations, we propose HindSight - an umbrella term for the design space of representing interaction history directly in existing data visualizations. In this paper, we examine the value of HindSight principles by augmenting existing visualizations with visual indicators of user interaction history (e.g. How the Recession Shaped the Economy in 255 Charts, NYTimes). In controlled experiments of over 400 participants, we found that HindSight designs generally encouraged people to visit more data and recall different insights after interaction. The results of our experiments suggest that simple additions to visualizations can make users aware of their interaction history, and that these additions significantly impact users' exploration and insights.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7539616","History;Interaction;Visualization","Context;Data analysis;Data visualization;Encoding;History;Human computer interaction;Visualization","Web sites;data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction;information retrieval","HCI;HindSight designs;HindSight principles;Website links;data visualization;digital objects;direct encoding;information saturated environments;interaction footprints;personal interaction history;physical objects;user exploration;user insights;user interaction history;visual channels;visual indicators;visualization augmentation","","","","","","20160810","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, while prior efforts have done in-depth analysis on architectural characteristics of traditional multimedia processing and text-based retrieval algorithms, there has been no systematic study towards the emerging multimedia retrieval applications. This may impede the architecture design and system evaluation of these applications. In this paper, we make the first attempt to construct a multimedia retrieval benchmark suite (MMRBench for short) that can be used to evaluate architectures and system designs for multimedia retrieval applications. MMRBench covers modern multimedia retrieval algorithms with different versions (sequential, parallel and distributed). MMRBench also provides a series of flexible interfaces as well as certain automation tools. With such a flexible design, the algorithms in MMRBench can be used both in individual kernel-level evaluation and in integration to form a complete multimedia data retrieval infrastructure for full system evaluation. Furthermore, we use performance counters to analyze a set of architecture characteristics of multimedia retrieval algorithms in MMRBench, including the characteristics of core level, chip level and inter-chip level. The study shows that micro-architecture design in current processor is inefficient (both in performance and power) for these multimedia retrieval workloads, especially in core resources and memory systems.

The advance of web proxy/caching has recently been in place to mitigate this phenomenon using the concept of locality and proximity. There exist some traditional caching schemes, such as FIFO, LFU, LRU, and Size, but with key limitations on the precision. On the other hands, soft computing has recently been investigated due to its advantage of high precision. Thus, this paper proposes a novel caching method by integrating these twos. SVM was first used for classification, to divide the caching probability - to be replaced or else. Then, LFU was applied for the actual replacement given new web objects (if cache full); and these are Hybrid LFU-SVM. Its performance is practically confirmed from our intensive evaluation against SVM-LRU and its traditional schemes like LFU and LRU in order of 14% to 52.3% and 18% to 63.2%, for hit and byte hit rate, respectively, using a standard NLANR dataset.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2033-1; POD:978-1-5090-2034-8","10.1109/JCSSE.2016.7748932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748932","Hybrid Caching;Least Frequency Used;Proxy;Replacement;Soft Computing;Support Vector Machine;Web Caching;Web Proxy","Artificial neural networks;Fuzzy logic;Internet;Kernel;Radio frequency;Support vector machines;Training","Internet;cache storage;information retrieval;pattern classification;support vector machines","FIFO;Internet infrastructure;NLANR dataset;SVM-LRU;Web access;Web caching scheme;Web objects;Web proxy;caching probability;hybrid LFU-SVM;hybrid least frequently used;locality concept;proximity concept;service providers;support vector machine","","","","","","","13-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, many researchers consider the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) feature as an important descriptor in image retrieval systems, whereas it is independent of color and just describes the local gradient distribution, so, false-positive matches may occur in the matching task. To solve the problems, we propose a color-based SIFT matching method for partial-duplicate image retrieval that extracts the region with abundant visual content from image as a salient region. Then, keypoints are achieved from the region by applying SIFT, and color histogram is computed for each of them to improve the accuracy of image matching results. Our extensive experiments on IPDID and INSTRE datasets with 79% and 52% MAP measure respectively indicate the excellent performance of our method.","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2016.7585742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7585742","color-based SIFT;images matching;partial-duplicate images;salient region","Electrical engineering;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Image segmentation","feature extraction;gradient methods;image colour analysis;image matching;image retrieval;information retrieval systems;transforms","INSTRE dataset;IPDID dataset;MAP measure;color histogram;color-based SIFT matching method;color-based scale-invariant feature transform matching method;false-positive matches;features extraction;local gradient distribution;partial-duplicate image retrieval method;region extraction;visual content","","","","","","","10-12 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In agricultural crop monitoring, such mechanism is very helpful in enhancing the efficiency of message spreading and farmers responding to sudden events. Thus, this paper tries to embed Pub/Sub mechanism into OGC web services which have been used in agricultural crop monitoring to search, access, describe and process the related data and information. This paper presents an initial framework to enable Pub/Sub in OGC web services via external supports. A Pub/Sub registry center is established for OGC web services and service users to subscribe and publish. Changes in OGC web services will be published as new messages to the registry. The registry will notify all the subscribers under the same theme with the message. A prototype is implemented for the framework. Some tests are made on a WCS, WMS and WFS. The results shows that through the prototype system, farmers or agricultural department can be timely notified about the changes such as new added remote sensing products about agricultural fields.","","","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2016.7577653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577653","OGC;Pub/Sub;agricultural crop monitoring;geospatial web services;remote sensing","Agriculture;Monitoring;Optical wavelength conversion;Prototypes;Remote sensing;Standards;Web services","Web services;agricultural engineering;crops;information retrieval;message passing;middleware","OGC Web services;agricultural crop monitoring;information access;information process;information search;message spreading;pub-sub mechanism;pub-sub registry center;publish-subscribe mechanism;service users","","","","","","","18-20 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this tutorial paper is to illustrate the central role that tools originally developed in the context of systems theory, can play in accomplishing this task. Specifically, we show that many of these problems can be recast into an identification form that exhibit a sparse underlying structure. In turn, this sparsity can be exploited to recast the problem into a convex optimization form that can be efficiently solved with first order methods.","","","10.1109/CCA.2016.7587864","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7587864","","Atomic measurements;Context;Data mining;Data models;Linear systems;Optimization;Sensors","convex programming;data handling;information retrieval;very large databases","convex optimization;data collection capabilities;dynamics role;first order methods;identification form;sparse encoded information extraction;sparsity role;systems theory;very large data sets","","","","","","","19-22 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the prediction results, the problems that will gain popularity over time can be addressed before they become very common. The posts in question and answer websites have a longer lifespan than other online content such as news articles which are short lived and have a high user activity at the beginning that decrease with time. This indicates that the user activity in question and answer websites is not an accurate measure of popularity in an early stage.
