Statistical information can be simply and conveniently picked by feature histograms, structural information description is much more complex. In order to deal with it we are introducing the concept of hierarchical decomposition of pattern areas. Areas are described using statistical information by feature histograms, size and number of areas reflects structural information. This formulation unifies statistical and structural information and the problem of minimizing structural information is stated as reducing the number and size of the histograms. We illustrate this on an example of retrieval from face image database using features based on quantized block transform coefficients. We can show that very limited structural information is needed for nearly perfect retrieval performance equal to the best available algorithms.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414328","","Discrete cosine transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Geometry;Helium;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Shape measurement;Statistical distributions","feature extraction;image retrieval;statistical analysis;visual databases","face image database;feature histograms;feature locations geometry;features distribution statistics;quantized block transform coefficients;statistical pattern retrieval;structural information description;structural pattern retrieval","","0","","17","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some insights of the mechanism of how various aggregation schemes work are discussed through the effects of model parameters in the unified framework.

This extended model treats trunk volumes as random quantities. A concept of random forest reflection coefficient is also introduced to characterize radar returns from individual trees. Based on the extended model, a set of algorithms for estimating the mean trunk (stem) volume from synthetic aperture radar data at the individual tree level is developed assuming that the areal tree density is known. The algorithms are specified for different scenarios related to <i>a priori</i> information on parameters of statistical distributions for the trunk volume and fluctuations of the forest reflection coefficient. An approximate lower bound on the standard deviation in the unbiased estimation of the mean trunk (stem) volume is proposed. This bound can be readily obtained by means of computer simulation for any specified statistical distribution for the trunk volume and fluctuations of the forest reflection coefficient. Performance analysis for the proposed algorithms is numerically performed by means of Monte Carlo simulation for a variety of scenarios. This analysis has shown that the algorithms provide nearly unbiased and efficient estimates, and the proposed lower bound is a very accurate approximation.

The VA incorporates estimated replacement dates into its equipment management database, but these dates are often ignored. Analysis of the accuracy of these dates revealed that they are only predictive for non-medical equipment and are highly inaccurate for medical equipment. A survey of VA biomedical and clinical engineers showed how those in equipment management positions viewed the importance of equipment replacement planning (ERP) and how ERP is currently conducted at various VA hospitals. Survey results also showed which of eight equipment replacement indicators (age, safety, obsolescence etc.) were considered the most important to the VA engineers. This allowed weighting factors to be assigned to each of the indicators. The resultant ERP tool will be tailor-made for VA use. Users were able to prioritize which medical devices should be replaced in a way that will remove subjectivity and anecdotal ideas from the equation, thereby allowing all types of medical equipment to be objectively prioritized.","2160-6986;21606986","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1033-0; POD:978-1-4244-1032-3","10.1109/NEBC.2007.4413384","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413384","","Biomedical engineering;Biomedical equipment;Clinical diagnosis;Databases;Enterprise resource planning;Histograms;Hospitals;Information retrieval;Performance analysis;Process planning","biomedical equipment;database management systems;medical information systems","Veterans Administration;equipment management database;equipment replacement planning tool;medical devices;medical equipment","","0","","10","","","10-11 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel aspect of UnMask is its use of a database to not only store information related to the email and its constituent parts (such as IP addresses, links, domain names), but also to organize a workflow to automatically launch UNIX tools to collect additional information from the Internet. The retrieved information is in turn added to the database. Reports can then be automatically generated according to the needs of the forensic investigator, including correlations across multiple email data stored in the database. UnMask is a working system.

We adopt the bag-of-visual-words architecture which has proven successful in achieving high precision at low recall. Unfortunately, feature detection and quantization are noisy processes and this can result in variation in the particular visual words that appear in different images of the same object, leading to missed results. In the text retrieval literature a standard method for improving performance is query expansion. A number of the highly ranked documents from the original query are reissued as a new query. In this way, additional relevant terms can be added to the query. This is a form of blind rele- vance feedback and it can fail if 'outlier' (false positive) documents are included in the reissued query. In this paper we bring query expansion into the visual domain via two novel contributions. Firstly, strong spatial constraints between the query image and each result allow us to accurately verify each return, suppressing the false positives which typically ruin text-based query expansion. Secondly, the verified images can be used to learn a latent feature model to enable the controlled construction of expanded queries. We illustrate these ideas on the 5000 annotated image Oxford building database together with more than 1M Flickr images. We show that the precision is substantially boosted, achieving total recall in many cases.","1550-5499;15505499","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1631-8; POD:978-1-4244-1630-1","10.1109/ICCV.2007.4408891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408891","","Data engineering;Data mining;Feature extraction;Feedback;Geometry;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Solid modeling;Vocabulary","image retrieval;relevance feedback;very large databases;visual databases","bag-of-visual-words architecture;blind relevance feedback;generative feature model;image verification;object retrieval;query image;text retrieval literature;text-based query expansion;total recall;visual domain","","239","11","20","","","14-21 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically there is a semantic gap between the low-level features extracted form the images and high-level concepts required by the user. This paper proposes an ontology-based search and retrieval as a supplementary method to associate high- level concepts and semantics to medical image data and exploit these semantic media for information search and retrieval. The main goal is to perform a search on a medical image repository and to retrieve relevant medical images and information to a particular case in order to assist diagnosis process.

In this paper, we build on the ideas of the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) that has been successfully used in the document retrieval community. Under this probabilistic framework, any song will be projected into a relatively low dimensional space of ""latent semantics"", in such a way that that all observed similarities can be satisfactorily explained using the latent semantics. Additionally, this approach significantly simplifies the song retrieval phase, leading to a more practical system implementation. The suitability of the PLSA model for representing music structure is studied in a simplified scenario consisting of 10.000 songs and two similarity measures among them. The results suggest that the PLSA model is a useful framework to combine different sources of information, and provides a reasonable space for song representation.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414343","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414343","","Acoustic measurements;Brightness;Content based retrieval;Fuses;Informatics;Information resources;Mathematical model;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Recommender systems","information retrieval;music;semantic networks","document retrieval;music recommendation systems;music structure;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;similarity fusion;song representation","","6","","13","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Bayesian Radar Algorithm for Hydrometeor Classification at C-band (BRAHCC) is supervised by a backscattering microphysical model, aimed at representing ten different hydrometeor classes in water, ice, and mixed phase. The expected error budget is evaluated by means of contingency tables on the basis of C-band radar noisy and attenuated synthetic data. Its accuracy is better than that obtained from a previously developed fuzzy logic C-band classification algorithm. As a second step of the overall retrieval algorithm, a multivariate regression is adopted to derive water content statistical estimators, exploiting simulated polarimetric radar data for each hydrometeor class. The BRAHCC methodology is then applied to a convective hail event, observed by two C-band dual-polarized radars in a network configuration. The hydrometeor classification along the line of sight, connecting the two C-band radars, is performed using the BRAHCC applied to path-attenuation-corrected data. Qualitative results are consistent with those derived from the fuzzy logic algorithm. Hydrometeor water content temporal evolution is tracked along the radar line of sight. Hail vertical occurrence is derived and compared with an empirical hail detection index applied along the radar connection line during the whole event.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.906476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4396959","Bayesian inversion;hydrometeor classification and estimation;polarimetry;radar meteorology;rain clouds","Backscatter;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Content based retrieval;Fuzzy logic;Ice;Information retrieval;Multivariate regression;Radar polarimetry;Radar tracking","Bayes methods;atmospheric humidity;atmospheric precipitation;fuzzy logic;ice;meteorological radar;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar","BRAHCC;Bayesian statistical approach;C-band polarimetric radar;backscattering microphysical model;convective hail event;fuzzy logic C-band classification algorithm;hail detection index;hail vertical occurrence;hydrometeor classification;multivariate regression;overall retrieval algorithm;radar connection line;supervised classification;water content statistical estimation","","26","","37","","","Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These documents can easily be found in several forms, such as documents in different versions, small documents combined with others to form a larger document, etc. As the Web is becoming more and more popular, the number of documents on the Web is increasing on a daily basis, and filtering redundant ones among this huge number of documents becomes a more difficult and an urgent task. As one of the solutions to this problem, we present a new method that identifies similar documents based on phrase matching using the fuzzy-word correlation factors among words in phrases. Since phrases can be treated as sequences of words in a sentence in any document, we consider the correlation factors of different words in any two phrases of two different documents to determine the degree of similarity of the phrases, which in turns can determine the similarity of the documents based on the number of matched phrases/sentences in the documents. Experimental results show that our phrase-matching approach is accurate and outperforms the word-based similarity matching approach.","","POD:0-7695-2874-0","10.1109/FSKD.2007.602","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406070","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Degradation;Floods;Fuzzy sets;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Infrared detectors;Optical computing","document handling;fuzzy set theory;information filtering;pattern matching","Web document;Web information retrieval;document filtering;document similarity;fuzzy-word correlation factors;phrase matching;word sequence","","1","2","10","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To extract word images from image regions, the character components need to be separated from graphic components. For this process, we propose a method to separate them with an analysis of box-plot using a statistics of structural components. An accuracy of this method is not sensitive to the changes of images because the criterion of separation is defined by the statistics of components. And then the character regions are determined by analyzing a local crowdedness of the separated character elements. Finally, we divide the character regions into text lines and word images using projection profile analysis and gap clustering, etc. The proposed system could reduce the influence resulted from the changes of images because it uses the criterion based on the statistics of image regions.","","POD:0-7695-2874-0","10.1109/FSKD.2007.617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406462","","Computer graphics;Image analysis;Image decomposition;Image retrieval;Indexes;Information retrieval;Internet;Software libraries;Statistical analysis;Statistics","document image processing;statistical analysis;text analysis","box-plot;character components;document images processing system;graphic components;image regions;mixed text/graphics images;statistical analyses;statistical methods;structural components;text lines;word extraction;word image decomposition;word images","","1","","6","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such constraints give rise to partial equivalence relations. The absence of class labels prevents the use of standard discriminative methods in this scenario. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art techniques that use partial equivalence relations, e.g., relevant component analysis, learn projections that are optimal for data representation, but not discrimination. We show that this leads to poor performance in several real-world applications, especially those with high-dimensional data. In this paper, we present a novel discriminative technique for the classification of weakly-labeled data which exploits the null-space of data scatter matrices to achieve good classification accuracy.

A lot of work has been done on Farsi retrieval systems. Local context analysis is a query expansion method to improve retrieval performance. In this paper we have tried to tune LCA for Farsi language. We used Hamshahri collection and 60 queries to tune three parameters in LCA method which are number of concepts used for query expansion, number of initially retrieved documents for local feedback and number of passages for concept discovery and weighting. The results reveal that there is a possible optimization point when 20 concepts are used; however, increasing the other two parameters which are number retrieved documents and number of passages used for local feedback almost always yields better results.","","POD:0-7695-3040-0","10.1109/SMAP.2007.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414397","","Data mining;Feedback;Fuzzy systems;History;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Performance analysis;Testing;Text analysis;Writing","document handling;information retrieval systems;natural language processing;query processing","Farsi documents;Farsi language;Farsi retrieval systems;local context analysis;query expansion method","","1","","22","","","17-18 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most classic classification systems represent the contents of documents with a set of index terms, which is termed the vector space model (VSM). However, this method requires a high dimensional space to represent the documents, and it does not take into account the semantic relationship between the terms, which could lead to a poor classification performance. In this paper, we introduce latent semantic indexing (LSI) in our systems. It could not only reduce the dimensionality to a great extent but also determine important associative relationships between the terms. The LSI also aids in accelerating the training speed and improves the classification accuracy. We test our classification systems on the standard Reuter-21578 collection. The experimental evaluations show that the system training with the LSI is considerably faster than the original system training with the VSM and that the former yields better classification results.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3045-1; POD:0-7695-3045-1","10.1109/ISITC.2007.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4410598","","Artificial neural networks;Indexing;Inference algorithms;Information retrieval;Information technology;Internet;Labeling;Large scale integration;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks","backpropagation;document handling;indexing;multilayer perceptrons","BPNN;LSI;MOPL;VSM;artificial neural network;back-propagation neural network;document classification;latent semantic indexing;multioutput perceptron learning algorithm;standard Reuter-21578 collection;vector space model","","0","","11","","","23-24 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) is a popular approach whereby the semantics and statistics can be effectively captured for modeling. However, PLSA is highly sensitive to task domain, which is continuously changing in real-world documents. In this paper, a novel Bayesian PLSA framework is presented. We focus on exploiting the incremental learning algorithm for solving the updating problem of new domain articles. This algorithm is developed to improve document modeling by incrementally extracting up-to-date latent semantic information to match the changing domains at run time. By adequately representing the priors of PLSA parameters using Dirichlet densities, the posterior densities belong to the same distribution so that a reproducible prior/posterior mechanism is activated for incremental learning from constantly accumulated documents. An incremental PLSA algorithm is constructed to accomplish the parameter estimation as well as the hyperparameter updating. Compared to standard PLSA using maximum likelihood estimate, the proposed approach is capable of performing dynamic document indexing and modeling. We also present the maximum a posteriori PLSA for corrective training. Experiments on information retrieval and document categorization demonstrate the superiority of using Bayesian PLSA methods.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2007.909452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4381232","Bayesian theory;Dirichlet distribution;conjugate prior;incremental learning;natural language processing;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;statistical document modeling","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Matrix decomposition;Maximum likelihood estimation;Natural languages;Parameter estimation;Statistical analysis","Bayes methods;computational linguistics;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;probability;text analysis","Dirichlet densities;adaptive Bayesian PLSA;incremental learning algorithm;natural language processing;parameter estimation;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;statistical document modeling","","32","3","28","","","Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The aim is to model potential semantic descriptions of basic objects in the images, the dependencies between them, and the conditional probabilities involved in those dependencies. This information is then used to calculate the probabilities of the effects that those objects have on each other in order to obtain more precise and meaningful semantic labels for the whole images. However, the proposed method is not restricted to the specific region-based approach used in this paper. Rather, the proposed method can be applied in any region-based image retrieval systems.

We first present a generic mid-level representation for audio queries. Unlike previous efforts in the literature, the proposed representation is not dependent on the different spectral characteristics of different musical instruments and the accurate location of note onsets and offsets. This is achieved by first mapping the short term frequency spectrum of consecutive audio frames to the musical space (the spiral array) and defining a tonal identity with respect to center of effect that is generated by the spectral weights of the musical notes. We then use the resulting single dimensional text representations of the audio to create a-gram statistical sequence models to track the tonal characteristics and the behavior of the pieces. After performing appropriate smoothing, we build a collection of melodic n-gram models for testing. Using perplexity-based scoring, we test the likelihood of a sequence of lexical chords (an audio query) given each model in the database collection. Initial results show that, some variations of the input piece appears in the top 5 results 81% of the time for whole melody inputs within a 500 polyphonic melody database. We also tested the retrieval engine for small audio clips. Using 25s segments, variations of the input piece are among the top 5 results 75% of the time.","","POD:978-1-4244-1273-0","10.1109/MMSP.2007.4412902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412902","","Audio databases;Hidden Markov models;Instruments;Laboratories;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Signal processing algorithms;Spatial databases;Speech analysis;Testing","audio signal processing;music;query processing;signal representation;smoothing methods","audio query representation;frequency spectrum;lexical chords;n-gram statistical sequence models;perplexity-based scoring;polyphonic music retrieval;smoothing;statistical modeling","","4","","14","","","1-3 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wu et al., 2004) is a new method of concealing secret information in several host images, leaving smaller traces than conventional steganographic techniques, and requiring a collection of affected images for secret information retrieval. Fusion system designs of the future will require enhanced security measures for distributed data communication. DIS, compared to other conventional steganographic techniques, can improve security and information hiding capacity because DIS leaves reduced signatures of hidden information in host images. The open literature does not offer effective detection methods and countermeasures for DIS, indicating that it can be potentially usable to criminals for unchallenged covert communication over the Internet and fusion architectures. In this paper, we explore a new information extraction method for both detecting and reversing DIS method by considering images as pseudo-random processes. The key idea is to estimate secret image as a random process, which is corrupted by a noise source (i.e. host image). The secret images may be nonlinear, non-Gaussian and non- stationary in nature, and can be disclosed by using some estimation techniques such as Kalman filtering. Our proposed method demonstrates great promise to reveal a secret image. Consequently, it is useful for intelligence gathering and information extraction in steganographic - images produced by DIS.","","CD-ROM:978-0-662-45804-3","10.1109/ICIF.2007.4407976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407976","distributed image steganography;estimation;image quality matrix;steganalysis","Communication system security;Data communication;Data mining;Data security;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Information security;Internet;Random processes;Steganography","Kalman filters;data communication;image processing;multimedia communication;telecommunication security;visual communication","Internet;Kalman filtering;concealing secret information;distributed data communication;distributed steganographic images;fusion architectures;information extraction method;multimedia information;noise source;pseudo-random processes;secret information retrieval","","0","","9","","","9-12 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, the multiplication of matrix-vector product can be accomplished in time proportional to the size of the representation. However, the conventional preconditioning techniques for an explicit matrix are not applicable since no coefficient matrix is actually constructed. In this work, a preconditioning matrix for the fast hierarchical method (FHM) is proposed by carefully examining inherent properties of the hierarchical data structure in the FHM. This preconditioning matrix significantly enhances convergence of the iterative solution yet preserves the implicit nature of the matrix operations in the FHM.

Most existing methods employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or Uniform Scaling to handle these problems. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based method for matching of this human motion captured data. We convert the matching problem of motion capture data into a transportation problem. To solve this problem efficiently, we employ Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as the matching framework. To penalize any strayed matching, we provide a ground distance that works similar to Sakoe- Chiba band of DTW.

However, its performance depends heavily on the distance metric being employed. The recently proposed large margin nearest neighbour (LMNN) classifier [21] learns a distance metric for kNN classification and thereby improves its accuracy. Learning involves optimizing a convex problem using semidefinite programming (SDP). We extend the LMNN framework to incorporate knowledge about invariance of the data. The main contributions of our work are three fold: (i) Invariances to multivariate polynomial transformations are incorporated without explicitly adding more training data during learning - these can approximate common transformations such as rotations and affinities; (ii) the incorporation of different regularizes on the parameters being learnt; and (Hi) for all these variations, we show that the distance metric can still be obtained by solving a convex SDP problem. We call the resulting formulation invariant LMNN (lLMNN) classifier. We test our approach to learn a metric for matching (i) feature vectors from the standard Iris dataset; and (ii) faces obtained from TV video (an episode of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer').

The extra equations can be built by using linear or nonlinear relationship between neighbor band emissivities because the emissivity of every land surface type is almost constant for bands 11, 12, 13, and 14. The neural network (NN) can make full use of potential information between band emissivities through training data because the NN simultaneously owns function approximation, classification, optimization computation, and self-study ability. The training database can be built through simulation by MODTRAN4 or can be obtained from the reliable measured data. The average accuracy of the land surface temperature is about 0.24 K, and the average accuracy of emissivity in bands 11, 12, 13, and 14 is under 0.005 for test data. The retrieval result by the NN is, on average, higher by about 0.7 K than the ASTER standard product (AST08), and the application and comparison indicated that the retrieval result is better than the ASTER standard data product. To further evaluate self-study of the NN, the ASTER standard products are assumed as measured data. After using AST09, AST08, and AST05 (ASTER Standard Data Product) as the compensating training data, the average relative error of the land surface temperature is under 0.1 K relative to the AST08 product, and the average relative error of the emissivity in bands 11, 12, 13, and 14 is under 0.001 relative to AST05, which indicates that the NN owns a powerful self-study ability and is capable of suiting more conditions if more reliable and high-accuracy ASTER standard products can be compensated.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.907333","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407630","Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data;emissivity;land surface temperature (LST)","Computer networks;Function approximation;Information retrieval;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Neural networks;Nonlinear equations;Radiometry;Reflection;Training data","geophysical signal processing;image processing;land surface temperature;neural nets;radiative transfer","ASTER imagery;MODTRAN4 simulations;land surface emissivity;land surface temperature;neural network;radiative transfer","","16","","56","","","Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We employ a qualification of experience, and validate this qualification as a measure of expertise to replace the documents. In our model, the relevance of a candidate's expertise to a given topic is estimated by its likelihood of generating topic words. Our evaluation on TREC test collection indicates the effectiveness of the probabilistic model in expert finding. This model is able to be improved by clustering of the relevant experience measures, which can also save retrieval time.","","POD:0-7695-2874-0","10.1109/FSKD.2007.157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4405971","","Databases;Humans;Information retrieval;Performance evaluation;Qualifications;Testing;Time measurement","business data processing;information retrieval;pattern clustering;probability;text analysis","enterprise corpora;enterprise expert finding;expert experience probabilistic model;language modeling technique;large organization;likelihood estimation;text retrieval","","0","","14","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though content-based image retrieval (CBIR) got great progress, current low-level visual information based retrieval technology does not allow users to retrieval images by high-level semantics. We propose an approach to describe and to extract the fuzzy aesthetic semantics of art images. Accordance with the subjectivity and vagueness of human aesthetic perception, we utilize the linguistic variable to describe the image aesthetic semantics, so it becomes possible to depict the image in linguistic expression such as 'very action'. Furthermore, we apply the feedforward neural network to model the process of human aesthetic perception and to extract the fuzzy semantic feature vector. The retrieval methodology makes users more naturally find desired images by linguistic expression and experimental implementation demonstrates good potential on retrieval art images with a human-accustomed manner.","","POD:0-7695-2874-0","10.1109/FSKD.2007.511","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406110","","Art;Content based retrieval;Feedforward neural networks;Fuzzy neural networks;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Neural networks;Ontologies","art;content-based retrieval;fuzzy set theory;image retrieval;linguistics","content-based image retrieval;digitized art images;fuzzy aesthetic semantics;fuzzy semantic feature vector;high-level semantics;human aesthetic perception;image aesthetic semantics;linguistic expression;linguistic variable;retrieval technology;semantics-based art image retrieval;visual information","","2","","10","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper explains connections between basic learning research and practical strategies for engaging students in large engineering classrooms. First, we ground proposed instructional strategies with theory and empirical evidence on such key matters as how students represent ideas in memory, how these representations are elaborated and perfected over time, and how stored information can be retrieved for use. This helps us to understand how students learn to monitor and control their own learning and how large class environments can be approached as sites for significant learning. We discuss how electronic student response devices (clickers) have been useful for generating in-class interaction and active learning in large classes for individual and team activities. How to administer beneficial team-based projects for large classes is also presented, including: real-world problems that require teams to investigate and understand contemporary issues such as sustainability, working with industry, and third- world countries.

The network employs a reputation-based trust management system to assess and update data labels, and to store and retrieve labels safely in the presence of malicious peers.

Six visual features allow users to express their visual perception of a bird and the query will be formulated based on the chosen features.

In recent years, the number of shape-based image retrieval techniques has dramatically increased; however, each technique has both advantages and shortcomings. This paper proposes a consensus-based fusion algorithm to integrate several shape-based image retrieval techniques so as to enhance the performance of the image retrieval process. In this algorithm, several techniques work as a team: they exchange their ranking information based on pair-wise co-ranking to reach a consensus that will improve their final ranking decisions. Although the proposed algorithm handles any number of CBIR techniques, only three common techniques are used to demonstrate its effectiveness. Several experiments were conducted on the widely used MPEG-7 database. The results indicate that the proposed fusion algorithm significantly improves the retrieval process.","","CD-ROM:978-0-662-45804-3","10.1109/ICIF.2007.4408090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408090","Consensus;fusion;image retrieval;shape","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Digital images;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Internet;MPEG 7 Standard;Multimedia databases;Shape","content-based retrieval;image fusion;image retrieval","MPEG-7 database;consensus-based fusion algorithm;content-based image retrieval;fusion algorithm;information exchange;pair-wise coranking;performance enhancement;shape-based image retrieval","","1","","22","","","9-12 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, traditional data broadcasting assumes that mobile users can only retrieve one data item in each time slot. Therefore, the above constraint leads to access conflicts and requires the mobile users to wait until the next broadcast cycle to retrieve the requested information. In this paper, we propose a novel data broadcasting framework that adopts network coding with the stored data items in users. In our approach, a server encodes multiple data items in each time slot, while each mobile user is able to retrieve the data item by decoding the encoded data items with the locally stored data items. We propose an algorithm to generate the broadcast program to minimize the average access time. In addition, our algorithm can avoid coding redundant data in each time slot to reduce access delay. Our simulation results show that our algorithm can reduce the access time by 56% as compared to no coding scheme.","1930-529X;1930529X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1043-9; POD:978-1-4244-1042-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.1013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4411923","","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Data engineering;Decoding;Delay effects;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Network coding;Network servers","bandwidth allocation;broadcasting;channel allocation;encoding;mobile computing;query processing","access delay;bandwidth efficiency;channel allocation algorithm;coding redundant data;demand-oriented encoding problem;dependent data broadcasting;mobile computing environment;network coding;query processing;requested information retrieval","","3","","8","","","26-30 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The idea of evasive data storage is that data moves around the sensor network instead of remaining at a fixed location. In this way, an adversary, who has once (through node capture) had access to the data stored at some particular node, must compromise more sensors in order to maintain his illegitimate access to the sensor data. We refine the previously published simple evasive data storage techniques in two ways: (1) we improve the efficiency of data retrieval by bounding the area in which data may move, (2) we introduce data splitting as a technique to protect against sleeper attacks in which the adversary simply takes over a subset of nodes and waits for valuable data to pass by.
