This exhaustive matching process increases the response time of the system and, potentially, the rate of erroneous identification. A method that narrows the list of potential identities will allow the input data to be matched against a smaller number of identities. We describe a method for indexing large-scale multimodal biometric databases based on the generation of an index code for each enrolled identity. In the proposed method, the input biometric data is first matched against a small set of reference images. The set of ensuing match scores is used as an index code. The index codes of multiple modalities are then integrated using three different fusion techniques in order to further improve the indexing performance. Experiments on a chimeric face and fingerprint bimodal database indicate a 76% reduction in the search space at 100% hit rate. These results suggest that indexing has the potential to substantially improve the response time of multimodal biometric systems without compromising the accuracy of identification.","2160-7508;21607508","POD:978-1-4244-3994-2","10.1109/CVPRW.2009.5204311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204311","","Bioinformatics;Biometrics;Delay;Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Image databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;Iris;Large-scale systems","biometrics (access control);database indexing;image matching","biometric identification systems;index code;large-scale multimodal biometric databases;multimodal biometric database indexing;reference images","","10","4","21","","","20-25 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On one hand, browsing videos on Internet becomes highly inefficient for the need to repeatedly fast-forward videos of similar content. On the other hand, the tremendous amount of somewhat duplicate content also makes some traditionally difficult vision tasks become simple and easy. For example, annotating pictures can be as simple as recycling the tags of Internet images retrieved from image search engines. Such tasks, of either to eliminate or to recycle near-duplicates, can usually be achieved by the nearest neighbor search of videos from Internet. The fundamental problem lies on the scalability of a search technique, in face of the intractable volume of videos which keep rolling on the Web. In this paper, we investigate scalability of several well-known features including color signature and visual keywords for Web-based retrieval. Indexing these features based on embedding technique for scalable retrieval is also presented.

A key service for the WoT is searching for entities which exhibit a certain dynamic state at the time of the query, which is a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of the sought state information and due to the potentially huge scale of the WoT. In this paper we introduce a primitive called sensor ranking to enable efficient search for sensors that have a certain output state at the time of the query. The key idea is to efficiently compute for each sensor an estimate of the probability that it matches the query and process sensors in the order of decreasing probability, such that effort is first spent on sensors that are very likely to actually match the query. Using real data sets, we show that sensor ranking can significantly improve the efficiency of content-based sensor search.","","Electronic:978-1-60558-371-6; POD:978-1-4244-5108-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211927","Ranking;Search;Sensors;Web of Things","Databases;Indexes;Information retrieval;Internet;Middleware;Mobile handsets;Permission;Predictive models;Search engines;Web pages","Web services;query processing;search engines","Web of Things;content-based sensor search;high-level state information;query;sensor ranking","","9","","22","","","13-16 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And the GMDW and the approach based on histogram of DC image are integrated into an operator called united difference degree in which it comes true that more accurate difference between two adjacent I-Frames is measured. Finally, more accurate shot boundaries or wrong shot boundaries are detected by the analysis of macro-block in P or B frame between two adjacent I-Frames on a detected segment position.

The prefilters are learned from training examples, and refined at query time to produce an approximately bounded response set. We cast prefiltering as an optimization problem: for each test query, select the OR-of-AND filter which maximizes training-set recall for an adjustable bound on response set size. This may be efficiently implemented by selecting from a large pool of candidate conjunctions of Boolean features using a linear program relaxation. Tests on object class recognition show that this relatively simple filter is nevertheless powerful enough to capture some semantic information.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206582","","Dictionaries;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image sampling;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Testing;Visual databases","Internet;content-based retrieval;image retrieval;information filters;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;search engines;text analysis","AND filter;Boolean feature;OR filter;Web-scale text search engine;linear program relaxation;machine learning;object class recognition;optimization;query-dependent prefilter;response set size;scalable content-based image retrieval;similar-image search;skipped inverted file","","13","2","23","","","20-25 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a novel method for learning discretized local geometry representation based on minimization of average reprojection error in the space of ellipses.

Given that networks generate the possibility of interpersonal communication, data on technology use can provide important information on sociability. However, it is also true that personal networks not only shape, but also are shaped by technological means for communication, since these entail the re-constituting of social ties and the re-drawing of social boundaries.We use material from empirical studies (Metal 2.0 Research Project) carried out over the last 2 years to develop our hypothesis of the way forms of business relationship change with technology. In particular, we try to understand the relationship between social networks (a set of social ties possessing one or more relational dimensions), exchanges between business actors (made up of a succession of embodied gestures and language acts) and the various technical means for communication available today, which enable an exchange to be completed. Each of these three poles poses constraints on interaction, and provides resources for it, and thus all three shape the form relational practices take. Empirical data show how technological means of communication allow people to re-negotiate the constraints of individual time rhythms, and of who one communicates with. They also illustrate how the relational economy (and power) is affected by the deployment of communication technologies. Tools of communication provide new resources to negotiate individual timetables and social exchanges, making it possible to adjust roles, hierarchies and forms of power in relational economies. The traditional communication model, where tele-communication is used to connect people who are physically separated from each other, is gradually being supplanted with a new pattern of ldquoconnected presencerdquo. In this new mode other people are telep- oned, ldquoSMSedrdquo, seen and mailed in alternated way and small gestures or signs of attention are at least as important as the message content itself.","","POD:978-1-4244-4135-8","10.1109/ICCIE.2009.5223558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5223558","Metal-mechanic SME's;SIOC;Semantic Web;Social Network;Web 2.0","Business communication;Communications technology;Companies;Content based retrieval;HTML;Information retrieval;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Postal services;Semantic Web;Social network services","Internet;business data processing;social networking (online)","Metal 2.0 research project;Web 2.0;connected presence;relational economy;social networks;value added identification","","0","","13","","","6-9 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, a novel phase-dependent baseband model is developed to quantitatively describe the ultrasonic signals and the associated interference characteristics. A Fourier approximation algorithm is then applied to retrieve the timing information by separating the primary and secondary echoes from the received baseband echo signal to enhance the measurement resolution.

Matching results can be applied to induce more accurate and complete object descriptions, remove data redundancy, check data consistency and generate cross-links. In this paper, we present a multilevel approach to match data between pathway databases that consist of 3 levels of information, compounds, reactions and pathways. Compounds comprise reactions, and reactions comprise pathways. Our main idea is to use relationships discovered in lower levels to infer relationships in upper levels, and use relationships in upper levels to enhance relationships in lower levels. In particular, we first use attributes of compounds to identify compound matching, i.e. to map compounds in one database to those in another database. Compound matching is then used to induce reaction matching. Reaction matching is used to induce pathway matching as well as to enhance compound matching. We experiment our approach for integration of two well known pathway databases KEGG and MetaCyc. The experiment shows that our approach identifies 1025 matchings in compound level, 968 matchings in reaction level, and 387 relations in pathway level. According to matching result, we assign EC number to 84 reactions in MetaCyc that do not have EC number, and discover some duplicate errors in both databases. Furthermore, our approach identifies 532 of the 544 unification links provided by MetaCyc. The recall rate is 0.977.","","POD:978-0-7695-3656-9","10.1109/BIBE.2009.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211283","Biochemical Pathway;Data Matching;Integration;KEGG;MetaCyc","Bioinformatics;Biology computing;Computer errors;Computer science;Data engineering;Databases;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Organisms;Redundancy","biochemistry;biology computing;database management systems","KEGG pathway database;MetaCyc pathway database;biochemical pathway databases;compound matching;data matching;map compounds;multilevel approach;reaction matching","","0","1","13","","","22-24 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to ensure portability, such replication protocols can be implemented in a middleware and some of such middleware systems use triggers for managing writeset collection. MADIS is an example of such systems. It has been developed assuming PostgreSQL as its underlying DBMS. Thus, its protocols are usually oriented to enforce snapshot isolation and rely on multiversioned concurrency control. PostgreSQL provides in its catalog information regarding its multiversioned control and such information can be used by the replication middleware for improving its writeset collection and application performance, without requiring any knowledge about DBMS's internals nor compromising the independence between the middleware and the DBMS layer.

More research projects and commercial systems are working on supporting triggers in XML database systems in recent years. This paper describes our approach to incorporate fuzziness into XML triggers. By adding a thin layer to an existing database, fuzzy expressions can be used within triggers to specify application level constraints declaratively. Our system provides support to fuzziness over traditional XML databases, while the underlying XML data remains crisp. As a result, any existing application will not be affected and is not required to be altered when using our approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only research reported to support fuzzy triggers in XML database systems. This paper describes the language of the fuzzy trigger, the system architecture, and the implementation with a motivating example.","","POD:978-1-4244-4114-3","10.1109/IRI.2009.5211568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211568","Fuzziness;Triggers;XML","Biological systems;Books;Computer science;Database systems;Fuzzy systems;Information retrieval;Markup languages;Relational databases;Web sites;XML","XML;fuzzy set theory;relational databases","XML database system;application level constraint;fuzzy trigger;integrity constraint management;relational database system","","3","","10","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We extend DEMD which is a fast technique of extending 1D EMD to 2D case by introducing scale and rotation invariance. Features including frequency and envelopes of IMFs are extracted after 2D Hilbert transform. Decomposition in several directions is made for rotation invariance and main direction is used.

The diversity of user demands and their frequent changes necessitate the need for dynamic and personalized meta-queriers. This paper presents a mapping management system, called M-Repository, to facilitate the implementation of meta-queriers with two innovative features: personalized source selection and dynamic reconfiguration. To support such two features, M-Repository is designed to contain two unique functionalities: 1) reuse-oriented mapping discovery, 2) semantic-based mapping organization.

In this paper, a new correlation-based interesting-ness measure that is used at both stages is proposed. The association rules are generated by a novel interesting-ness measure obtained from applying multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to explore the correlation between two feature-value pairs and concept classes. Then the correlation-based interesting-ness measure is reused and aggregated with the inter-similarity and intra-similarity values to rank the final rule set for classification.

This involves the use of singular value decomposition (SVD) which creates a new abstract and uses a way of finding pattern document collection in matrix representation, so that it can identify between the terms and documents which are similar. By using various numbers of patterns (rank) of SVD, the proposed method is applied to cluster documents using the fuzzy C-means algorithm.

This can degrade its retrieval performance significantly, especially in cases where there are many similar images with different orientations.

A feature term denotes an interval of one media feature dimension, such as a bin in colour histogram. This approach (1) can easily accumulate features from multiple query examples to generate an efficient query; (2) enables the exploration of text-based retrieval models for multimedia retrieval. Two criteria, minimised chi<sup>2</sup> and maximised entropy, are proposed to optimise feature term selection. Two ranking functions, KL divergence and tf-idf based BM25 model, are used for relevance estimation.

Since the brute-force naive search is too time consuming for most applications, several tailored data structures have been proposed to improve the efficiency of NN search. Among these, vantage point tree (vp-tree) was introduced for information retrieval in metric spaces. Vptrees have recently shown very good performances for image patch retrieval with respect to the L<sub>2</sub> metric. In this paper we generalize the seminal vp-tree construction and search algorithms to the broader class of Bregman divergences. These distorsion measures are preferred in many cases, as they also handle entropic distances (e.g., Kullback-Leibler divergence) besides quadratic distances. We also extend vp-tree to deal with symmetrized Bregman divergences, which are commonplace in applications of content-based multimedia retrieval. We evaluated performances of our Bvp-tree for exact and approximate NN search on two image feature datasets. Our results show good performances of Bvp-tree, specially for symmetrized Bregman NN queries.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-4290-4","10.1109/ICME.2009.5202635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202635","Bregman divergences;Nearest neighbor queries;vantage-point trees","Application software;Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Data structures;Extraterrestrial measurements;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Neural networks;Performance evaluation","computer vision;content-based retrieval;data structures;image retrieval;query processing;search problems;trees (mathematics)","Bregman divergences;Bregman vantage point trees;L<sub>2</sub> metric;computer vision;content-based multimedia retrieval;data structures;entropic distance;image feature dataset;image patch retrieval;information retrieval;nearest neighbor queries;nearest neighbor retrieval;quadratic distances;search algorithm","","5","","9","","","June 28 2009-July 3 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous approaches have used other TVM and motion capture data as queries and the cost for query generation was a significant issue. Instead, the proposed system uses 2D video queries, which can be easily captured by a single camera, enabling end users to retrieve 3D motion sequences such as TVM and motion capture data easily and interactively. We introduce the P-type Fourier descriptor, which is a feature of 2D contour images. TVM and computer graphics sequences rendered from motion capture data are silhouetted rendering from multiple viewpoints. Feature vectors for TVM and motion capture data are generated by applying the P-type Fourier descriptor to these silhouetted images. Experimental results using four TVM sequences and motion capture data demonstrated an average retrieval accuracy of 88% in terms of nearest neighbors.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-4290-4","10.1109/ICME.2009.5202629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202629","2D video;P-type Fourier descriptor;TVM;motion capture;retrieval;silhouette","Cameras;Computer graphics;Costs;Data mining;Information retrieval;Mesh generation;Nearest neighbor searches;Rendering (computer graphics);Shape;Spatial databases","Fourier transforms;computational geometry;feature extraction;image motion analysis;image sequences;information retrieval systems;rendering (computer graphics);solid modelling;video cameras;video retrieval","2D contour images;2D video queries;P-type Fourier descriptor;camera;computer graphics sequences;dynamic three-dimensional mesh model sequences;motion capture data;query generation;retrieve 3D motion sequences;silhouette shape descriptors;time-varying mesh;video retrieval systems","","6","","15","","","June 28 2009-July 3 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generic images contain various miscellaneous objects and scenes. Therefore, desirable annotation results are subjective and underspecified. To overcome this problem, it is important to assume ""weak labeling"" framework, where images are weakly related to multiple words without region information. In this paper, we propose a high speed and high accuracy image annotation and retrieval method based on efficient learning of the contextual latent space. A distance between samples can be defined in the intrinsic feature space for annotation using latent space learning between images and labels. The proposed method is shown to be faster and more accurate than previously published methods.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-4290-4","10.1109/ICME.2009.5202630","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202630","Image Context;Latent Space;Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis;Scalable Learning","Image analysis;Image generation;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information science;Labeling;Layout;Space technology","image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","contextual latent space learning;generic images;image annotation method;image retrieval method;target images","","8","","15","","","June 28 2009-July 3 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The color histogram with 166 colors in HSV space represents the image color information. A vector with 12 values represents the texture information obtained by applying Gabor filters.

We introduce more accurate information to the CECH, by virtue of incorporating color edge detection using vector order statistics. This produces a more accurate representation of edges in color images, in comparison to the simple color pixel difference classification of edges as seen in the CECH. Our proposed method is thus reliant on edge gradient information, thus we call it the Color Edge Gradient Co-occurrence Histogram (CEGCH). We also introduce a novel color quantization scheme based in the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space, illustrating that it is more suitable for image retrieval in comparison to the color quantization scheme introduced with the CECH. Results illustrate that our retrieval system retrieves logos and trademarks with good accuracy, outperforming the use of the CECH in image retrieval with higher precision and recall.","1546-1874;15461874","POD:978-1-4244-3297-4","10.1109/ICDSP.2009.5201266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5201266","Color Edge Gradient Co-occurrence Histogram (CEGCH);HSV quantization;color edge detection;logo and trademark retrieval;pattern recognition","Color;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image databases;Image edge detection;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Object detection;Quantization;Trademarks","content-based retrieval;edge detection;image classification;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;visual databases","color edge detection;color edge gradient cooccurrence histograms;color image databases;content-based unconstrained logo;hue-saturation-value color space;image representation;image retrieval;trademark retrieval;vector order statistics","","1","","13","","","5-7 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
