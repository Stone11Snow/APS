Current methods of storing and retrieving information through databases involve the use of traditional relational architecture model. However, as new technologies and methods evolve, an object-oriented (OO) architecture model can better serve the cataloging needs of those assets systems. This paper explores the possibility of using this architecture model to provide scalable digital assets management system that can track multiple digital printing assets and provide cross-sectional views of the assets. By implementing the model, end user will have greater power over data without programmersÂ¿ involvement. The proposed approach can also be applied to searching, cataloging, and retrieving of other digital asset information that includes, but not limited to, designer of credit cards in card-making factories, business offices or facilities, manufacturing plants or warehouses and so on.","","POD:978-0-7695-3336-0","10.1109/CSSE.2008.1559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4723193","Asset Management Model;Object-oriented model;cataloging;digital asset management system","Asset management;Credit cards;Digital printing;Industrial relations;Information retrieval;Object oriented databases;Object oriented modeling;Power system modeling;Production facilities;Relational databases","cataloguing;digital libraries;information retrieval;object-oriented methods;printing industry","digital assets management system;information cataloging;information retrieval;information searching;multiple digital printing asset tracking;object-oriented model;printing industry","","0","","11","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Visually meaningful color logo is encoded as the watermark information. Due to its characteristics, the key problem is to decide how to hide as many bits information as possible into the image while ensuring the information can be retrieved correctly, even after various attacks. In this paper, a new method is proposed to resolve it. For the frequency domain of color logo after Daubechies9/7 wavelet transform, just only low frequency and intermediate frequency coefficient is chosen as the watermark code. In order to ensure both the robust and transparency, intermediate frequency coefficient after Daubechies9/7 wavelet transform is also proposed to embedding watermark code. To achieve the lowest computational cost and provide security, the lifting scheme was presented to implement the wavelet transform. The central contribution of this paper is to develop a watermark algorithm, resilient to like JPEG2000 lossy compression attack and other mainstream attacks, embedding compressed color logo image as watermark and extracting it correctly. Experimental results show that the proposed watermark scheme is computational and quite robust in face of various attacks such as JPEG2000 compression with high compression ratios, filtering, cropping, etc.","","POD:978-0-7695-3336-0","10.1109/CSSE.2008.1517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4722446","Daubechies9/7;JPEG2000 compression;intermediate frequency coefficient;lifting scheme","Copyright protection;Cultural differences;Frequency;Image coding;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Robustness;Transform coding;Watermarking;Wavelet transforms","copyright;frequency-domain analysis;image coding;image colour analysis;security of data;watermarking;wavelet transforms","Daubechies9/7 wavelet transform;JPEG2000 compressed cultural heritage images;JPEG2000 lossy compression attack;color logo watermark;compressed color logo image;copyright protection;digital museum system;embedding watermark code;frequency domain;intermediate frequency coefficient;lifting scheme;security;watermark algorithm;watermark information","","0","","18","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the present work describes a successful experience in which assessment by peers was employed as a learning technique in a graduate course in Faculty Development to evaluate oral presentations. A seminar assessment form was developed by the instructors and used to give immediate feedback to the students on their performance. The same form is used by the students to assess their peers. This assessment by peers is not used by the instructors to compose the grades on the course, but as a tool to enhance awareness of the students to the quality of their own work. It was verified that the quality of the seminars improved faster when peer assessment was employed, and that the assessment by the students approached the assessment by the instructors as the course progressed.","0190-5848;01905848","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1970-8; POD:978-1-4244-1969-2","10.1109/FIE.2008.4720270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4720270","Assessment;learning;metacognition;peer","Automatic testing;Education;Employee welfare;Feedback;Information retrieval;Reflectivity;Seminars;Springs","educational courses","active learning;graduate course;learning technique;peer assessment;seminar assessment form","","2","","25","","","22-25 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When first choices fall by the wayside, quick recalculations of schedules are necessary in order to determine the next best scenario and sections to request. As inexperienced junior faculty members, the authors found this experience daunting. In response, they wrote a simple web application that allowed faculty to make their selections, and broker deals, in a calm manner over an extended time period. The application was originally written for one sub-group of about 20 faculty within the department, but its popularity quickly spread to the rest of the department and then on to other departments within the college. The course assignment and reservation system (CARS) has grown steadily over the past several years in number of users, functionality, and scope. Today, faculty can plan their teaching load, work with colleagues to find mutually beneficial schedules, and easily retrieve historical information in preparation for annual reviews, promotion, or tenure appointments. Department administrators can manage course information, prepare information for certification agencies, assign faculty to courses, and monitor faculty loads.

Duplicate records lower the efficiency of information retrieval. In this paper, we propose an approach, named length filtering and dynamic weighting (LFDW) for duplicate records cleansing. There are three steps in LFDW. The first step is length filtering. In this step, according to the length of record, those record pairs are sifted if there exists a big difference in their lengths. Secondly, this approach detects duplicate records using dynamic weighting properties. Specially, since author name is the important property of literature and one author may has different styles of name, a fuzzy name matching method is adopted to identify the same author who has different name style. Finally, to improve the performance of duplicate detection, we adopt a dynamic sliding-window algorithm when comparing records. The result indicates the time, recall and precision of LFDW are better than traditional ones.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3401-5","10.1109/SKG.2008.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725901","","Computer science;Databases;Filtering algorithms;Filters;Grid computing;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Libraries;Runtime;Scalability","data handling;distributed databases;fuzzy set theory;pattern matching","data format diversity;duplicate records cleansing;dynamic sliding-window algorithm;dynamic weighting;fuzzy name matching method;heterogeneous databases;information retrieval;length filtering","","0","","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensor nodes generate, store, and retrieve information as both data producers and consumers. The intensive demand of data exchange within the network leads previous approaches with sensor-to-sink transmission model inefficient. In-network data storage schemes, such as geographical hash table (GHT) and double-rulings, have been accordingly proposed to structure the information storage among the network so as to facilitate the consumers to efficiently discover and retrieve data. Under those approaches, however, each sensor node needs to publish and retrieve data from different routes calculated every time, introducing unnecessary computation and communication overhead. This paper proposes anew approach that stores and queries data through bouncing tracks. Sensors are able to publish replica of generated data along their bouncing tracks and successfully retrieve data from other sensors along the same tracks, which largely simplifies data exchange and improves efficiency. The strengths of this design also include distance-bounded data retrieval. We conducted extensive simulations and the results show that this approach outperforms existing designs, including rumor routing and double-rulings, in terms of communication efficiency and cost.","1521-9097;15219097","POD:978-0-7695-3434-3","10.1109/ICPADS.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724369","Bouncing tracks;WSN;data center storage","Costs;Degradation;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Load management;Memory;Protocols;Publishing;Routing;Sensor systems","electronic data interchange;information retrieval;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks","bouncing tracks;data exchange;data storage schemes;data-centric wireless sensor network;distance-bounded data retrieval;geographical hash table;information retrieval;sensor-to-sink transmission model","","0","","14","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In each query session, the algorithm maintains weights on the images in the database which reflect the assumed relevance of the images. Relevance feedback is used to modify these weights. As a second ingredient, the algorithm uses a minimax principle to select images for presentation to the user: any response of the user will provide significant information about his query, such that relatively few feedback rounds are sufficient to find a satisfactory image.

Therefore, query-by-multiple-example (QBME) method is proposed and adopted, in which query images are divided into groups according to relevance to target image class. In order to maximize major features and minimize minor ones, previous researches have introduced adaptive distance computation in QBME.

The experiments show that the LDA processing approach can achieve average accuracy 78%, which is a 45% relative improvement over simple approach on 30s test data.","","POD:978-0-7695-3505-0","10.1109/IITA.Workshops.2008.212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4732132","GMM-LM;LDA;language identification","Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Information science;Information security;Information technology;Linear discriminant analysis;NIST;National security;Natural languages;Testing","Gaussian processes;natural language processing","Chinese dialects;Gaussian mixture model;NIST language recognition evaluation tasks;back-end processing approach;language identification;language-dependent language model;linear discriminant analysis;minority languages","","1","","12","","","21-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Group negotiation has two types of decision making: collaborative and competitive strategies. The collaborative strategy is a type of decision making under which any player in negotiation groups would not leave from non-rep eatable games of finite stakes on their possible agreements, while the competitive strategy is the other style of decision making under which any player in negotiation groups would leave for other repeatable games of infinite stakes on their possible agreements. Those two types of strategies are selective for increasing negotiated gains under temporary constraints in the response to properties of infinite and finite stakes on repeatable and non-rep eatable negotiation games, respectively. The proposed method provides decision support systems with the command of strategic decision making on group collaboration under temporary constraints.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2972-1; POD:978-1-4244-3694-1","10.1109/AMIGE.2008.ECP.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721450","","Collaboration;Costs;Decision making;Decision support systems;Decision trees;Design engineering;Game theory;Information processing;Information retrieval;Knowledge management","decision making;group decision support systems","decision support systems;group collaboration;strategic decision making;temporary constraints","","2","","14","","","28-29 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, the software development process needs to be tailored to reflect the specific characteristics of the software project. So, if we can retrieve a similar process to a new project, process tailoring will be less costly and less error-prone because the retrieved process can be tailored to the new case with fewer modifications. In this paper, we propose the case retrieval method based on structural similarity. The structural similarity is calculated by the degree that process elements in a past case are applicable to a new project. By measuring the structural similarity, the retrieved process is ensured to be tailored to the new case with fewer modifications. We validate the usefulness of our method through the experiments using 30 cases.","1530-1362;15301362","POD:978-0-7695-3446-6","10.1109/APSEC.2008.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724531","case retrieval;knowledge base;process tailoring","Information retrieval;Productivity;Programming;Quality management;Software engineering;Software quality","knowledge based systems;software reusability","case retrieval method;knowledge-based software process;software development process;software project;structural similarity","","8","","14","","","3-5 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we describe a method to classify moving objects into one of six colors. The method includes two sets of parameters. The first set can be used to compensate for illumination conditions and camera differences. The second set is used to tune the color extraction for specific object types and optimal retrieval. The tuning can be performed after video analysis has extracted metadata in real-time. The metadata is fed into a database which can be interactively queried by the user. The ability to query with feedback makes it possible to successfully find events of interest during an investigation without performing real-time adaptation which might be error-prone. In addition, for situations in which tracking moving objects is difficult, the system can generate significant colored object snippets of moving colored objects for retrieval. If the event of interest is not found by the initial system, this backup system can be invoked ensuring that the relevant event is found.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3422-0; POD:978-0-7695-3341-4","10.1109/AVSS.2008.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4730426","color video surveillance retrieval","Cameras;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Lighting;Performance analysis;Surface texture;Video surveillance;Videoconference","image colour analysis;image motion analysis;image retrieval;video surveillance","camera differences;color extraction;color retrieval;colored moving objects;moving colored objects;surveillance cameras;video analysis;video surveillance","","2","","20","","","1-3 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of markup declarations is the only standardized method for creating document type descriptors, but it requires huge data type definitions with some additional properties to explain a true meaning. However, the extensible markup language schema is a way to accomplish the same goal using the language itself. This paper proposes a system to perform schema-to-schema mapping using Bayesian Belief Network as a novel intelligence system scheme for intelligent mapping. The new schema implementation based on Bayesian Network intelligent approach is proposed. The implementation issues of this schema decision support system with schema-to-schema data repository and the training algorithm with decision maker are proposed. An example of Schema-to-Schema Xpert Decision Support System pattern schema-to-schema mapping in representations of relational databases and extensible markup language mapping with the empirical results are proposed to investigate the new intelligence system paradigm utilization.

Two measurements are usually considered when discussing the efficient location of data items: the path length (the hop count for resolving a lookup request on the overlay network)and the latency (the actual time period between the issuing and completion of a lookup). In this paper, we propose two protocols based on Chord which is well-known and basic for locating data on DHTs. The first approach, enhanced bidirectional chord (EB-Chord), keeps the finger tables on two directions and uses a heuristic to select the next hop to achieve a short path length. By combining the idea of the Lookup-Parasitic Random Sampling (LPRS), the second approach, enhanced bidirectional chord with lookup-parasitic random sampling (EB-Chord-LPRS), can greatly reduce the average latency. We last validate our protocols through extensive experiments. In comparison with other algorithms, such as Chord, Bidirectional Chord, Low Latency Chord, and LPRS-Chord, our experimental results show that the proposed approaches reduces the path length and latency more than 33% respectively.","1521-9097;15219097","POD:978-0-7695-3434-3","10.1109/ICPADS.2008.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724405","Peer-to-Peer networks;distributed hash table;latency;path length","Delay;Fingers;Information retrieval;Length measurement;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Sampling methods;Time measurement","file organisation;graph theory;peer-to-peer computing;protocols;random processes;sampling methods;table lookup","chord-based P2P system;data location;distributed hash table;enhanced bidirectional chord;finger table;lookup-parasitic random sampling;peer-to-peer network;protocol;short path length","","4","","13","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, component reuse success is widely related to other activities such as the localization of components satisfying developer requirements.

To go beyond the limits of these approaches, we propose a structural and behavioral retrieval technique that takes in account the heterogeneity of the components repository (abstraction level, technology, domain, etc).

To define the edit operations, we use the paradigm of a graphical editing process and end up with a dynamic programming algorithm that we call time warp edit distance (TWED). TWED is slightly different in form from dynamic time warping (DTW), longest common subsequence (LCSS), or edit distance with real penalty (ERP) algorithms. In particular, it highlights a parameter that controls a kind of stiffness of the elastic measure along the time axis. We show that the similarity provided by TWED is a potentially useful metric in time series retrieval applications since it could benefit from the triangular inequality property to speed up the retrieval process while tuning the parameters of the elastic measure. In that context, a lower bound is derived to link the matching of time series into down sampled representation spaces to the matching into the original space. The empiric quality of the TWED distance is evaluated on a simple classification task. Compared to edit distance, DTW, LCSS, and ERP, TWED has proved to be quite effective on the considered experimental task.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479483","Dynamic programming;Pattern recognition;Similarity measures;algorithms;similarity measures.;time series","Computer Society;Costs;Discrete transforms;Enterprise resource planning;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Partitioning algorithms;Time measurement","dynamic programming;image representation;string matching;time series","discrete time series similarity;down sampled representation spaces;dynamic programming algorithm;dynamic time warping;graphical editing process;longest common subsequence;real penalty algorithms;stiffness adjustment;string-to-string correction problem;time series matching;time series retrieval applications;time warp edit distance;time-series-to-time-series-correction problem;triangular inequality property","0","56","","37","","20080331","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, these assumptions are not satisfied in many real-world application domains. Therefore, we present a framework called co-training by committee (CoBC), in which a set of diverse classifiers are used to learn each other. The framework is a simple, general single-view semi-supervised learner that can use any ensemble learner to build diverse committees.

The process can be time-consuming when the data set is large. This paper presents a multilevel framework to reduce the size of the data set, prior to performing dimension reduction. The algorithm exploits nearest-neighbor graphs. It recursively coarsens the data by finding a maximal matching level by level. The coarsened data at the lowest level is then projected using a known linear dimensionality reduction method. The same linear mapping is performed on the original data set, and on any new test data. The methods are illustrated on two applications: eigenfaces (face recognition) and latent semantic indexing (text mining). Experimental results indicate that the multilevel techniques proposed here offer a very appealing cost to quality ratio.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724975","dimensionality reduction;eigenfaces;latent semantic indexing;multilevel graph partitioning;nearest-neighbor graph","Face recognition;Indexing;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Machine learning;Performance evaluation;Sampling methods;Testing;Text mining;Traveling salesman problems","data reduction;face recognition;graph theory;image matching;indexing;information retrieval;text analysis","face recognition;graph-based multilevel dimensionality reduction;latent semantic indexing;linear mapping;maximal matching level;text information retrieval","","3","","19","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among them there are systems providing public transit information as well as path planning services, called advanced public transportation systems (APTS). However, most modern APTSs maintained their own individual transportation service information in a non-sharable fashion, thus planning paths for large scope is difficult since there is no information exchanging methods for existing APTS. In addition, existing researches usually employ shortest path algorithms, and did not take advantages of other semantic information such as geographic locations, service information, etc., thus usually are not scalable well for large scope trip planning. This work proposes a semantic-based APTS framework for transit planning, where semantic Web-based service interfaces are specified for information exchanging, making it possible to integrate and organize heterogeneous data from various APTS and transportation enterprises. In addition, a semantic-based trip-planning scheme is designed to be used in NimbleTransit, where service information is aggregated in advance using semantic knowledge. Semantic service composition is then used to construct the path. A system prototype is implemented, and the results showed that the proposed scheme is indeed more effective and scalable than existing schemes.","2153-0009;21530009","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2112-1; POD:978-1-4244-2111-4","10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4732604","","Automotive engineering;Computer science;Information retrieval;Information systems;Information technology;Intelligent transportation systems;Management information systems;Path planning;Prototypes;Technology management","Web services;graph theory;semantic Web;traffic information systems;transportation","NimbleTransit framework;advanced public transportation system;advanced traveler information system;information dissemination;information exchanging;path planning service;public transportation transit planning;semantic Web service interface composition scheme;shortest path algorithm;transportation enterprise","","2","","21","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe encoding a fuzzy ontology into a Fuzzy Tree Transducer (FIT) and then, define two simple functions for applying attained FIT on document feature vector. By using the first function, elements of document feature vector are modified to reduce distance between current document and relevant documents in the vector space. This reduction is so important for categorization of documents in index repository of IRSs. The second function uses the injection of relevant context into query term. The injected context causes relocation of query term in vector space, and reduces its distance from some semantically related documents.","","POD:978-0-7695-3493-0","10.1109/SITIS.2008.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725784","Feature Vector;Fuzzy Ontology;Fuzzy Tree Transducer;IR;Term Weighting","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Encoding;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Information retrieval;Mathematics;Ontologies;Transducers","document handling;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","background knowledge;content similarity;document feature vector modification;fuzzy ontology;fuzzy tree transducer;high quality document retrieval;information retrieval systems","","1","","23","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed algorithm consists of three key steps. Firstly, we introduce a utility function to select the k-best queries from the source domain labeled data. Secondly, feature augmentation is performed on both source and target domain data, which can straightly adapt the ranking information from source domain to target domain. Finally, we utilize the classical ranking SVM to learn the enhanced ranking function on the augmented features.

To avoid the confrontation with the semantic gap several approaches restrict the image dataset to web images. Web images mostly appear on websites with other text contents which can deliver important information about the image semantics. Popular image search engines use text contents surrounding the image to generate annotation keywords. Also emphasized text contents like headlines are assumed to be important description providers. Otherwise we discover false positive results in high ranking positions of this search engines which are the effect of incorrect text-to-image mappings. This paper addresses the problem of finding correct matches between text elements and images in HTML-documents by extending the DOM model tree of a web-page to a 2-dimensional object model (2-DOM) tree. This model adapts to the two dimensional manner of web documents and thus allows a better mapping of text articles to images. The evaluation results show that with a precision over 90 percent text articles are well assigned to web images. This leads intuitive to better textual information about the presented events on the images and thus yields to a better image retrieval quality in querying-by-keyword scenarios.","","POD:978-0-7695-3444-2","10.1109/SMAP.2008.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724840","2 DOM;Automatic Image Annotation;Document Object Model;Web Image Retrieval","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Digital images;Image generation;Image representation;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Physical layer;Search engines;Web sites","Web sites;hypermedia markup languages;image processing;image retrieval;search engines","2-DOM;2-dimensional object model;DOM model tree;HTML-documents;Web documents;Web image annotation;Web page;Web sites;annotation keywords;image retrieval quality;image semantics;search engines","","0","","12","","","15-16 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the problem of one-class classification on text stream with respect to concept drift where a large volume of documents arrives at a high speed and with change of user interests and data distribution. In this case, only a small number of positively labelled documents is available for training.

"Automatic Identification of Stop Words in Chinese Text Classification","L. Hao; L.

A fundamental tool in text classification is a list of 'stop' words(stop word list) that is used to identify frequent words that are unlikely to assist in classification and hence are deleted during pre-processing. Till now, many stop word lists have been developed for English language. However, there is no standard stop word list which has been constructed for Chinese text classification yet. In this paper, we give a refined definition for stop words in Chinese text classification from a perspective of statistical correlation, then propose an automatic approach to extracting the stop word list in text classification based on the weighted Chi-squared statistic on 2*p contingency table. We evaluate the stop word lists using accuracies obtained from text classification experiments in the real-world Chinese corpus. The results show that the proposed approach is effective. The stop word lists derived by the approach can speed up the calculation and increase the accuracy of classification at the same time.","","POD:978-0-7695-3336-0","10.1109/CSSE.2008.829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721850","Chinese text classification;Stop words;weighted Chi-squared statistic","Computer science;Employment;Information retrieval;Mathematics;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Software engineering;Statistics;Text analysis;Text categorization","information retrieval;natural language processing;pattern classification;statistics;text analysis","Chinese text classification;English language;automatic stop words identification;information retrieval;natural language processing;weighted Chi-squared statistic","","9","1","15","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As one of the known technology in the field of the recommender systems, collaborative filtering has been widely used in E-Commerce for its advantages. But the rating prediction mechanism of pure collaborative filtering is merely based on the ratings for visited items, and this limits its precision improvement. In this paper, we propose a refined hybrid recommender approach based on Widrow-Hoff learning algorithm. The proposed approach employs Widrow-Hoff algorithm to learn each userÂ¿s profile from the contents of rated items, to improve the granularity of the user profiling. With the refined user profiles, collaborative filtering is employed to compute more precise similarity of different users, and predicts the ratings for unrated items. The improvement of performance is demonstrated by the experimental evaluation.","2153-1447;21531447","POD:978-0-7695-3431-2","10.1109/FGCN.2008.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4734054","Hybrid recommender;User profiling;Widrow-Hoff","Adaptive systems;Collaboration;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Filtering;Hybrid power systems;Information retrieval;Information systems;Learning systems;Recommender systems","content-based retrieval;groupware","Widrow-Hoff learning;collaborative filtering;hybrid recommender approach","","1","","21","","","13-15 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The language model that we used is based on link grammar, which is a high lexical formalism. In order to apply language models based on link grammar in phrase-based models, we brought out the concept of linked phrases, which is an extension of the concept of traditional phrases in phrase-based models. Experiments were carried out and the results showed that the use of syntax-based language models could improve the performance of the phrase-based models greatly.","","POD:978-1-4244-2196-1","10.1109/ISKE.2008.4731040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731040","","Cognitive science;Information retrieval;Information science;Intelligent systems;Knowledge engineering;NIST;Natural languages;Predictive models;Speech recognition;Surface-mount technology","computational linguistics;language translation","SMT models;high lexical formalism;link grammar;phrase-based models;statistical machine translation;syntax-based language models","","0","","17","","","17-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
