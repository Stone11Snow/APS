Quantitative retrievals of aerosol backscatter and extinction profiles have also been obtained from the LITE 532 nm data using initial LITE calibrations and preliminary assumptions/modeling constraints regarding the aerosol extinction-to-backscatter ratio, S<sub>a</sub>, or auxiliary transmittance information. Two upcoming satellite lidar missions, GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) and CALIPSO(Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) have provided impetus for continued analysis of LITE data as a testbed for developing and validating improved aerosol retrieval approaches for these satellite missions.

IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","20021107","2002","2","","509","512 vol.2","In recent years, applications in multimedia databases have been more and more important. One new capability is to search by similarity in low-level image features (such as color, texture, shape, and motion). The performance of the similarity search highly relies on efficient index structures. However, current high-dimensional indexing techniques have limitations and a simple sequential scan algorithm can outperform them in many cases. We notice that few researchers have really evaluated the utilization of the actual memory size and the trade-off between I/O access time and computation time. Some methods tried to reduce the I/O access time but caused computation overhead. We propose a novel indexing technique, the RA-Blocks (Region Approximated Blocks), to overcome these limitations and improve the similarity search in multimedia databases. We also demonstrate the better performance of our work in experiments.","","POD:0-7803-7304-9","10.1109/ICME.2002.1035660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035660","","Indexing;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Multimedia databases;Partitioning algorithms;Shape","database indexing;database theory;feature extraction;image retrieval;multimedia databases;query processing;search problems","RA-Blocks indexing;Region Approximated Blocks;efficient index structures;image features;multimedia database;performance;similarity search;speed up","","3","","15","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given a set of protein structures, we compute the angles and distances of all the triplets of linear segments associated to the secondary structures of the proteins and use them to build hash tables. The hash tables can be used for fast retrieval of hypotheses of matches of a query protein against the database. We present and analyze the tables obtained for two separate sets of proteins that are representatives of all the folds in the PDB. The tables show an interesting distribution of the triplets of elements, especially if one takes into account that the elements of a triplet are generally not close in space. The majority of the elements are found to belong to two planar regions in the three-dimensional tables. The planar regions can be characterized as those whose corresponding triplets of structures lie on almost parallel planes.","","POD:0-7695-1521-4","10.1109/TDPVT.2002.1024166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1024166","","Computer science;Ear;Indexing;Information retrieval;Pattern recognition;Protein engineering;Quantization;Rivers;Spatial databases;Statistical analysis","computational geometry;database indexing;image matching;image retrieval;medical image processing;medical information systems;proteins","PDB;Protein Data Bank;database;geometric hashing;globular proteins;hash tables;hypothesis retrieval;indexing;linear segments;pattern recognition;protein structure comparison;query protein matches;secondary structures;triplet elements","","2","","24","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although we employ ontology like structures, called concepts, for metadata schemes used in annotations, our primary focus is on how concepts are actually used to annotate images and regions of interest, respectively, that exhibit features of interest to a researcher. It turns out that the combined consideration of domain specific concepts and annotated regions in images provides interesting means to analyze the usage of metadata regarding certain correctness and plausibility criteria.

We address the problems of replication proxy placement in the network and data replica placement on the installed proxies given that a maximum of M proxies are allowed. Both reads and writes are considered in these problems. The performance objective is to minimize the total data transfer cost. To address the placement problems, we first present the optimal solutions for a single object in a tree network without/with constraint on the number of replicas. Based on that, two schemes, namely, aggregate access (AGGA) and weighted popularity (WPOP), are proposed for the replication proxy placement problem. An optimal solution is described for the replica placement problem. The performance of the proposed placement schemes is evaluated with a set of carefully designed simulation experiments over a wide range of system parameters. The results give us several helpful intuitions in deploying transparent replication proxies in a practical system.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.802068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031909","","Aggregates;Authoring systems;Computer networks;Costs;Distributed computing;Explosives;Helium;Information retrieval;Sensor systems;System performance","cache storage;client-server systems;computer networks","AGGA;WPOP;aggregate access;caching;data replica placement;data transfer cost;hybrid transparent replication model;large distributed network;placement problems;reads;replica placement problem;replication proxy placement problem;system performance;transparent data replication proxy services;tree network;weighted popularity;writes","","46","1","28","","","Sep 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our retrieval system integrates machine translation, speech recognition and information retrieval technologies. An English news story forms a textual query that is automatically translated into Chinese words, which are mapped into Mandarin syllables by pronunciation dictionary lookup. Mandarin radio news broadcasts form spoken documents that are indexed by word and syllable recognition. The information retrieval engine performs matching in both word and syllable scales. The English queries contain many named entities that tend to be out-of-vocabulary words for machine translation and speech recognition, and are omitted in retrieval. Names are often transliterated across languages and are generally important for retrieval. We present a technique that takes in a name spelling and automatically generates a phonetic cognate in terms of Chinese syllables to be used in retrieval.

In collaboration with PEMEX Exploration and Production, RADARSAT-1 Wide mode images were used to evaluate wind retrieval. The CMOD_IFR2 model was used for wind field extraction. Based on analysis of the six RADARSAT-1 images, the mean difference between the buoy wind speed and the (mean) SAR-derived wind speed is 2.4 m/s and the mean difference between the buoy wind direction and the SAR-derived wind direction is about 50Â°. PEMEX is planning to use the SAR-derived wind data to aid in SAR-based ship detection and oil slick detection. From an operational perspective, it is important to note that SAR-derived wind fields do not require additional imagery, since the wind information can be extracted from the same set of images that are used for ship and oil spill detection.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1024968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1024968","","Collaboration;Data acquisition;Data mining;Information retrieval;Marine vehicles;Petroleum;Production;Radar detection;Radar imaging;Wind speed","meteorological radar;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;wind","CMOD IFR2 model;PEMEX;RADARSAT;RADARSAT-1;SAR;SAR-derived wind;marine atmosphere;measurement technique;meteorological radar;operational retrieval;radar remote sensing;spaceborne radar;surface wind speed;synthetic aperture radar;wide mode;wind","","2","","7","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We study the impact of cache replacement policy on the performance of Freenet. We find that, with Freenet's LRU (least recently used) cache replacement, there is a steep reduction in the hit ratio with increasing load. Based on intuition from the small-world models and the recent theoretical results by Kleinberg, we propose an enhanced-clustering cache replacement scheme for use in place of LRU. Such a replacement scheme forces the routing tables to resemble neighbor relationships in a small-world acquaintance graph - clustering with light randomness. In our simulation, this new scheme improved the request hit ratio dramatically while keeping the small average hops per successful request comparable to LRU. A simple, highly idealized model of Freenet under clustering with light randomness proves that the expected message delivery time in Freenet is O(log<sup>2</sup>n) if the routing tables satisfy the small-world model and have the size Î¸(log<sup>2</sup>n).","0743-166X;0743166X","POD:0-7803-7476-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019373","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019373","","Collaboration;Computer science;Contracts;Distributed control;IP networks;Information retrieval;Information science;Internet;Peer to peer computing;Routing","Internet;cache storage;graph theory;information resources;information retrieval;inter-computer links;telecommunication network routing","Freenet;cache replacement policy;data retrieval;enhanced clustering;peer-to-peer system;routing tables;small-world model","","1","","19","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, while VQ uses one codebook of one resolution to compress the images, Quadtree decomposition uses simultaneously 4 codebooks of four different resolutions. Image indexing is implemented by generating a feature vector (FV) for each compressed image. Accordingly, images are retrieved by means of FVs similarity evaluation between the query image and the images in the database, depending on a distance measure. Three distance measures have been analyzed to assess FV index similarity: Euclidean, intersection and correlation distances. Distance measures efficiency retrieval is evaluated for different VQ resolutions and different quadtree image descriptors.

However, these prototypes differ in implemented feature classes, user-interfaces and similarity measurement. VizIR aims at overcoming this unsatisfactory situation. The paper overviews wide-spread techniques for similarity measurement in CBIR, derives a general querying model and proposes conditions for similarity measurement algorithms on the macro-level.

A musical genre is characterized by the common characteristics shared by its members. These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure the large collections of music available on the Web. Currently musical genre annotation is performed manually. Automatic musical genre classification can assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval systems. In addition, automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based analysis of musical signals. In this paper, the automatic classification of audio signals into an hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically, three feature sets for representing timbral texture, rhythmic content and pitch content are proposed. The performance and relative importance of the proposed features is investigated by training statistical pattern recognition classifiers using real-world audio collections. Both whole file and real-time frame-based classification schemes are described. Using the proposed feature sets, classification of 61% for ten musical genres is achieved. This result is comparable to results reported for human musical genre classification.","1063-6676;10636676","","10.1109/TSA.2002.800560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021072","","Computer science;Cultural differences;Feature extraction;Humans;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Pattern recognition;Signal analysis;Wavelet analysis","audio signal processing;feature extraction;information retrieval;music;pattern recognition;signal classification;statistical analysis","World Wide Web;audio signals;automatic musical genre classification;content-based analysis;feature sets;genre hierarchies;harmonic content;human musical genre classification;instrumentation;music information retrieval systems;musical genre annotation;musical signals;pitch content;real-time frame-based classification;rhythmic content;rhythmic structure;statistical pattern recognition classifiers training;timbral texture;whole file classification","","703","35","33","","","Jul 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the present contribution, we analyze the benefits and limitations of striping files across multiple optical disks in order to speedup the retrieval of large pieces of information. We also show that server applications requiring both computer power and I/O bandwidth may be distributed over several processing nodes and access files striped over multiple optical disks.

The key point of the framework is to employ environment adaptation into the SPS encoding stage. This makes it possible to normalize acoustic variations and extract the language factor contained in speech signals as encoded SPS sequences. We confirm these characteristics by constructing a speech retrieval system on the SPS domain.

In this paper, we present experimental studies for classification of genetic sequences using both unsupervised and supervised approaches, focusing on both computational effort as well as a suitably defined classification performance measure. The results indicate that both unsupervised classification using the Maximin algorithm combined with FASTA sequence alignment algorithm and supervised classification using artificial neural network have good classification performance, with the unsupervised classification performs better and the supervised classification performs faster.

Implementation and experiences with some of the WAP-based physiological monitoring applications developed in our laboratory are presented. The applications were written; in Wireless Markup Language (WML), WMLScript, and Perl. A MySQL relational database system was set up to store blood pressure and heart rate readings, patient records, clinic and hospital information, doctors' appointments with patients, and ECG data. A wireless ECG subsystem was built, for recording indoor ambulatory ECG and for storing ECG data into the database.

To solve the scalability problem, some scalable peer-to-peer lookup services show up, such as CAN, Chord, Pastry and Tapestry. In this paper we propose a self organizing hierarchical virtual network infrastructure, called Grapes, for peer-to-peer lookup services. Hierarchical approach of Grapes brings two benefits.

In this approach, dissimilarity between two shapes is defined as the reconstruction error of the candidate shape, made by using multiscale elements of contours extracted from the query shape. This dissimilarity measure allows one to quickly produce an accurate short-list of candidate matches, ranked from the most similar to the least similar one, suitable for a more careful and more time consuming matching algorithm.

This is our attempt to establish a method, which covers a broad range of texts, journal articles, patent documents and state-of-the-art review papers, to observe the emergence of a new domain.

A PWS is a system to manage the information from the WWW, for either leisure or work related use. Similar to bookmarks, a PWS stores a set of URL addresses but, in addition, it caches on a proxy server pages of high interest. PWS is developed through an evolutionary process that is outlined in the paper. First, a method is prescribed to rank a page (or an URL address) based on the degree of importance to a person as determined by search engine responses and user input. Second, the information stored in a PWS must be refreshed periodically to keep up with the new state of information available on network; therefore a technique is proposed for determining and monitoring freshness. Thirdly, a PWS evolves through enlargement to include more information domains, or refinement to concentrate on smaller sub-domains. The paper describes how enlargement and refinement operations are mapped on to the stored PWS data dictionary. Finally, key-word queries can be issued against a PWS to get interesting information quickly. In this sense, a PWS uses a combination of information caching, information retrieval and bookmark technique to enhance significantly user performance on the Web.","","POD:0-7695-1588-6","10.1109/ICDCSW.2002.1030765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1030765","","Computer architecture;Dictionaries;Information management;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Search engines;Service oriented architecture;Software systems;Uniform resource locators;World Wide Web","cache storage;dictionaries;information resources;information retrieval system evaluation;query processing;relevance feedback;search engines","PWS;Personal Web Space;URL addresses;WWW;bookmarks;data dictionary;evolutionary process;freshness monitoring;high interest pages;importance rank;information caching;information retrieval;key-word queries;proxy server caching;search engine responses;software system;user input;user performance","","0","","19","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The study is meant to contribute to the improvement of algorithms for retrieval of two dimensional ocean wave spectra from LCS. Error bars for the LCS phase, which contains information on the ocean wave phase speed and propagation direction are derived. The error estimates depend on the respective LCS coherence and the amount of smoothing applied in the LCS estimation process. A model for the LCS coherence is introduced. The first part of the model describes the dependence of the coherence on system parameters like spatial resolution. The second part is associated with the motion of the imaged ocean wave field.

"New methods to infer snow albedo from the MISR instrument with applications to the Greenland ice sheet","J. C. Stroeve; A. W. Nolin","Cooperative Inst. for Res. in Environ. Sci., Colorado Univ., Boulder, CO, USA","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","20021107","2002","40","7","1616","1625","Snow-covered surfaces have a very high surface albedo, thereby allowing little energy to be absorbed by the snowpack. As the snowpack ages and/or begins to melt, the snow albedo decreases and more solar energy is absorbed by the snowpack. Therefore, accurate estimation of snow albedo is essential for monitoring the state of the cryosphere. This paper examines the retrieval of snow albedo using data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument over the Greenland ice sheet. Two different methods are developed and examined to derive the snow albedo: one based on the spectral information from MISR and one utilizing the angular information from the MISR instrument. The latter method is based on a statistical relationship between in situ albedo measurements and the MISR red channel reflectance at all MISR viewing angles and is found to give good agreement with the ground-based measurements. Good agreement is also found using the spectral information, although the method is more sensitive to instrument calibration, snow bidirectional reflectance distribution function models, and narrowband-to-broadband relationships. In general, using either method retrieves snow surface albedo values that are within about 6% of that measured at the stations in Greenland.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.801144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025526","","Ice;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Instruments;Monitoring;Reflectivity;Snow;Solar energy;Spectroradiometers;State estimation","albedo;glaciology;hydrological techniques;radiometry;remote sensing;snow","Greenland ice sheet;MISR;Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer;angular information;cryosphere;instrument calibration;red channel reflectance;snow bidirectional reflectance distribution function models;snow-covered surfaces;snowpack;solar energy absorption;spectral information;surface albedo","","19","","20","","","Jul 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Some assume a particular motion model or constrain the range of interframe motion, while others constrain both the region tracked and the background to have uniform and contrasting intensities. As a result, these tracking algorithms become byproducts of algorithms for motion or intensity boundary detection, and thus have limited applicability. We propose a novel algorithm for region tracking that uses the Bayesian framework for tracking previously developed. We extend this framework by re-expressing tracking in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence of specific probability distributions and generalizing these to empirical distributions computed over image neighborhoods, leading to level set equations in terms of local image statistics. The main novelty of our proposed algorithm is that contrary to other tracking algorithms which are expressed as level set PDEs, the motion is not assumed to be small, nor is the background assumed to be stationary, nor is the region supposed to be uniform and have strong contrast with the background. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on real image sequences with natural motion.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1039043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039043","","Image coding;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image sequences;Information retrieval;Level set;MPEG 4 Standard;Statistics;Surveillance;Tracking","Bayes methods;data compression;edge detection;image coding;image motion analysis;image sequences;probability;set theory","Bayesian framework;Kullback-Leibler divergence;MPEG-4;algorithm performance;empirical distributions;image neighborhoods;image region tracking;intensity boundary detection;interframe motion;level set PDE;level set equations;local image statistics;local statistics;motion boundary detection;natural motion;object based coding;probability distributions;real image sequences;surveillance;tracking algorithms;video databases","","3","","4","","","24-28 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, we present an unsupervised segmentation technique in which colour and texture models are learned from the image prior to segmentation, and whose output (including the models) may subsequently be used as a content descriptor in a CBIR system. These models are obtained in a multiresolution setting in which hidden Markov trees (HMT) are used to model the key statistical properties exhibited by complex wavelet and scaling function coefficients. The unsupervised mean shift iteration (MSI) procedure is used to determine a number of image regions which are then used to train the models for each segmentation class.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1039093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039093","","Context modeling;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Pixel;Signal processing;Wavelet coefficients","content-based retrieval;hidden Markov models;image colour analysis;image resolution;image retrieval;image segmentation;image texture;iterative methods;trees (mathematics);unsupervised learning;wavelet transforms","CBIR;colour models;complex wavelet coefficients;complex wavelets;content descriptor;content-based image retrieval;hidden Markov trees;image semantics;mean shift iteration;multiresolution setting;scaling function coefficients;statistical properties;texture models;unsupervised MSI;unsupervised image segmentation;unsupervised learning","","15","","7","","","24-28 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To help users accessing and manipulating MODIS data, various tools were developed by the MODIS Data Support Team (MDST). Some of these tools are described below: WHOM - the Web based Hierarchical Ordering Mechanism (WHOM) for Terra data is a customized version of the larger DAAC Web-based data gateway. WHOM offers enhanced graphic interfaces to identify temporal and spatial data coverage while searching and ordering MODIS data archived at the GES DAAC. An alternative ""No Frills"" page provides quick access (by passing navigation) directly to WHOM pages for products which users want to order. Browse images allow science data users to evaluate the data before ordering. MODIS Level 1B browse images are produced from the 1 km Calibrated Radiances product using channels 1, 4, 3 as true color during the day, and channel 32 as false color during the night. Subsampled at 5-km resolution products are generated at the GES DAAC so users can download smaller files. Subsetting Tools - calibrated radiance (Level 1B) channel subsetting is being developed as an extension to the EOS Core System (ECS). The front end, a graphic user interface, is part of WHOM. The new Simple Scalable Script-Based Science Processor (S4P) that interacts with ECS drives the back end for data retrieval, archiving and distribution of the subsetted data. Visualization Tools - the MDST has developed two very simple IDL-based tools to map MODIS swath products. The first, geoview, has a simple, graphic interface, while the second, simap, is a command line utility. Modis-atmos was designed to work with atmospheric products. HDFLook for MODIS is a result of joint collaboration between the GES DAAC and the University of Lille, France. An HDF-EOS version of a popular MSPHINX program was developed to work with all MODIS and many other HDF-EOS data. Its main features include: geo-mapping, geo-projection conversion, interactive and batch mode processing, subsetting and subsampling, stitching of several granules, multi-granule processing, and conversion into GIS-compatible formats.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1027130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1027130","","Data visualization;Drives;Earth Observing System;Geoscience;Graphics;Information retrieval;MODIS;NASA;Navigation;User interfaces","data visualisation;geophysical signal processing;information retrieval;remote sensing","ECS;EOS Core System;GES DAAC data tools;GIS-compatible format conversion;HDFLook;MDST;MODIS Data Support Team;MODIS data;MSPHINX program;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Distributed Active Archive Center;Simple Scalable Script-Based Science Processor;Terra satellites;WHOM;Web based Hierarchical Ordering Mechanism;atmospheric products;batch mode processing;calibrated radiances;command line utility;data archiving;data distribution;data retrieval;geo-mapping;geoprojection conversion;geoview;graphic interface;image browsing;interactive processing;multi-granule processing;subsampling;subsetting tools;visualization tools","","1","4","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once a matched candidate is found, its adjacent characters in the horizontal and vertical directions are examined for matching with other corresponding characters in the user-specified word/phrase, subject to the constraints of positional relation and size similarity. The character matching is done in two stages. The coarse matching is carried out based on the stroke density features. A weighted Hausdorff distance is proposed for the second matching phase.

We propose to use replication to reach optimal parallel I/O in multidisk/processor architectures. Replication is a well-known and effective solution for several problems in a database context, especially for availability and load balancing problems. Intelligent replication is considered. We especially focus on allocations based on latin squares and derive several nice properties for replication and declustering purposes. Three different replication strategies are proposed and evaluated. Using the proposed schemes, strict optimality is reached, even with a single replication, for all possible range queries and for several number of disks. We first show this for m-by-m grid on m disks, and then generalize it to any arbitrary a-by-b grids.

Furthermore, a mobile user may be interested in getting location dependent query results periodically. We propose an algorithm for handling continuous queries in a tree-structure in such a way that the user will get the correct current query result, not the outdated result. In addition our proposed method strives to reduce communication cost. Since data are related to a particular zone, the obvious approach is to replicate fragments of location dependent data (LDD) for each zone. If we follow the approach of replicating fragments of LDD information at each zone, we may not be able to meet the storage requirements in given zones. Therefore, full replication will not work. Hence, we propose an selective replication algorithm in the context of these continuous queries. Our replication algorithm is based on the user's query pattern. If a particular type of query is frequently requested from a particular zone, we will replicate its corresponding LDD in that zone.

Thanks to the low dimension of the unknown parameter vector, a systematic exploration of the parameter space could be carried out. This method allows the recovery of the optimal parameter set as well as an exhaustive description of the subdomain of acceptable solutions. The mapping of this subdomain points out the lack of constraints brought by the ERS dataset on the determination of the surface parameters. Particularly, additional constraints should be found on the rapid and short-scale variation of the soil moisture content. Moreover, it is shown that the distributions of the retrieved parameters are not normal nor log normal, as could be expected from random variables. As a consequence, the optimal parameter set is neither the average nor the maximum likelihood, and the computation of an a posteriori standard deviation of the parameters is meaningless.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.802500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046854","","Cost function;Information retrieval;Inverse problems;Land surface;Least squares methods;Radar measurements;Remote sensing;Soil moisture;Spaceborne radar;Uninterruptible power systems","hydrological techniques;moisture;remote sensing by radar;soil;spaceborne radar;vegetation mapping","ERS wind scatterometer data;Sahel;herbaceous above-ground biomass;land surface parameters;nonlinear optimization;optimal parameter set;soil moisture content;subdomain;unknown parameter vector","","9","","10","","","Sep 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our study aims to provide use case reuse, while relying only on the semantics of UML and the diagrams typically used by analysis. We present an automated technique that provides for the assisted reuse of use cases. A software analyst defines an initial description of a use case.

It is already known that the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is a nonconvex version of method of alternating projections. In this paper, we show that two other prominent phase retrieval methods also have well known counterparts in the world of convex optimization algorithms: Fienup's basic input-output algorithm corresponds to Dykstra's algorithm, and Fienup's hybrid input-output algorithm can be viewed as an instance of the Douglas-Rachford algorithm. This work provides a theoretical framework to better understand and, potentially, improve existing phase recovery algorithms.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1040082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1040082","","Information retrieval;Inverse problems;Iterative algorithms;Mathematics;Optimization methods;Phase estimation;Phase measurement;Physics;Statistics;Subspace constraints","iterative methods;optimisation;signal processing","Douglas-Rachford algorithm;Dykstra algorithm;Fienup basic input-output algorithm;Fienup hybrid input-output algorithm;Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm;method of alternating projections;phase recovery algorithms;phase retrieval problem;two dimensions","","2","","14","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, we develop an unsupervised method to discover clusters of video scenes and summarize them with a concise Gaussian mixture model. To search for the best possible model, an effective procedure is devised to compare among models with different dimensions (i.e., numbers of mixture components) and, for a given dimension, among models with different parameters. Second, we propose a scene interference measure to characterize the interaction among different scenes of a video sequence. When applied to the clustered video scenes, the measure can reveal the dominant video segments of a class of videos without requiring much domain-specific knowledge. The proposed methods have been tested with a large number of sports videos and promising results are reported.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1038099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038099","","Clustering algorithms;Color;Event detection;Geometry;Histograms;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Motion analysis","image classification;image segmentation;image sequences;pattern clustering;video signal processing","concise Gaussian mixture model;scene interaction;scene interference measure;scene-level semantics;sports videos;unsupervised method;video scenes;video sequence","","3","","12","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this framework, a controller consists of constraint solving components distributed in a network of embedded processors. Constraint solvers are goal oriented deliberative agents that can be used as control regulators or as information retrievers. The framework is built on the attribute/service model (ASM), a middleware for coordinating actuators, sensors and tasks in distributed real-time embedded systems. The communications and coordination among the services are realized via shared attributes. Examples of controlling a modular self-reconfigurable robot are illustrated in the paper.","","POD:0-7803-7398-7","10.1109/IRDS.2002.1041587","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041587","","Actuators;Buildings;Communication system control;Control systems;Information retrieval;Middleware;Regulators;Robot kinematics;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems","constraint theory;embedded systems;middleware;robot dynamics","ASM;actuator coordination;attribute/service model;complex dynamic structures;constraint solving components;control regulators;distributed real-time embedded systems;embedded processors;general constraint-based control framework;goal oriented deliberative agents;information retrievers;middleware;modular self-reconfigurable robots;sensor coordination;shared attributes;task coordination","","10","","23","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshop","20021210","2002","","","439","446","This paper proposes a set of algorithms to extract metadata about the documents in a digital library from the way these documents are used. Inspired by the learning of connections in the brain, the system assumes that documents develop stronger associations as they are more frequently co-activated. Co-activation corresponds to consultation by the same user, and decreases exponentially with the time interval between consultations. The strength of activation is proportional to the user's interest for the document, either evaluated explicitly, or inferred implicitly from user actions or the duration of the consultation. Co-activation values are added, producing a matrix of associations. This matrix can be used to recommend the documents that are most strongly related to a given document, most relevant to the user's implicit interest profile, or most interesting to users overall. Moreover, it allows the calculation of document similarity values, which in turn can be used to cluster similar documents. The data needed to feed such a recommendation system are readily extracted from the usage logs of document servers, and can be processed either in a centralized or a distributed manner.","1530-2016;15302016","POD:0-7695-1680-7","10.1109/ICPPW.2002.1039763","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039763","","Computer science;Data mining;Feeds;Information retrieval;Internet;Motion pictures;Quality control;Search engines;Software libraries","associative processing;digital libraries;meta data","Hebbian algorithms;associations;co-activation;digital library;document servers;matrix of associations;metadata;recommendation system;usage logs","","7","","19","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this, we developed a hybrid search tree called SKD-Metric tree. This novel approach merges the classification power of the statistical k-dimensional tree and the efficiency of computation of the Metric-tree for nearest neighbor (NN) search. Another feature of SKD-Metric tree is its flexibility to formulate a new metric function while the retrieval system utilizes user's feedback to improve accuracy. In addition, unlike traditional relevance feedback approaches that, in most cases, sequentially search the entire database to obtain new retrieval results, SKD-Metric tree features a fast retrieval refinement procedure that needs to update only a small portion of the database. An extensive study, based on experiments performed for evaluating retrieval precision and computational efficiencies, is presented. We have applied our approach to a large-scale medical image database. The experimental results show that SKD-Metric tree can achieve a high accuracy rate with dynamic relevance feedback that requires much less computation than existing techniques.","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-1695-X","10.1109/ICPR.2002.1044680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1044680","","Classification tree analysis;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Nearest neighbor searches;Neural networks;Spatial databases","computer vision;content-based retrieval;database indexing;image retrieval;relevance feedback","SKD-metric tree;content-based image retrieval systems;dynamic feedback;hybrid search tree;hybrid tree approach;image database retrieval;indexing mechanisms;large-scale image database search;medical image database;nearest neighbor search;relevance feedback approaches;statistical k-dimensional tree","","0","","11","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
