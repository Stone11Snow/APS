The scheme takes information about the spectral shape of different wave systems from a prior wave spectrum, while estimates for wavelength, waveheight and wave propagation direction are extracted from SAR cross spectra. The Partition Rescaling and Shift Algorithm (PARSA) is based on a partioning of a prior wave spectrum, e.g. taken from ocean wave models. For each ocean wave system a stochastic model is set up, which defines the probability that the propagation direction, the wavelength or the energy of the different wave systems deviate from the prior knowledge. The prescribed probabilities thereby quantify the confidence into the prior wave spectrum. Based on the probability models for the prior wave spectrum and the measured cross spectrum an optimal ocean wave spectrum is estimated using a maximum a posteriori approach. To solve the corresponding minimization problem the prior model is approximated with a multivariate Gaussian model. The optimization problem is solved with a Gauss-Newton method. The scheme is tested using both simulated cross spectra and reprocessed wave mode data acquired by the ERS-2 SAR. The reprocessed data are similar to the products, which will be available from the ENVISAT satellite launched in March 2002.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026477","","Data mining;Information retrieval;Ocean waves;Partitioning algorithms;Sea measurements;Spaceborne radar;Spectral shape;Stochastic systems;Synthetic aperture radar;Wavelength measurement","ocean waves;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","2D ocean wave spectra retrieval;ENVISAT;ERS-2 SAR;Gauss-Newton method;PARSA;Partition Rescaling and Shift Algorithm;complex SAR data;look cross spectra;multivariate Gaussian model;parametric inversion scheme;prior information;reprocessed wave mode data;spaceborne synthetic aperture radar;wave height;wave propagation direction;wavelength","","7","","9","","","24-28 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, users are often unable to obtain desired specific information within a well-defined subject area. Today's information systems do not provide efficient content navigation, incremental appropriate matching or content correlation. We are developing the following innovative technologies to remedy these problems: (1) scenario-based proxies, enabling the gathering and filtering of information customized for users within a pre-defined domain; (2) context-sensitive navigation and matching, providing approximate matching and similarity links when an exact match to a user's request is unavailable; (3) content correlation of documents, creating semantic links between documents and information sources; and (4) user models for customizing the retrieved information and the presentation of results. A digital medical library is currently being constructed using these technologies to provide customized information for the user. The technologies are general in nature and can provide custom and scenario-specific information in many other domains (e.g. crisis management).","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/4233.845202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845202","","Content based retrieval;Context modeling;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Information systems;Large-scale systems;Matched filters;Navigation;Software libraries","digital libraries;information retrieval;medical information systems;user modelling","approximate content matching;content correlation;content-based proxies;content-based retrieval;context-sensitive matching;context-sensitive navigation;crisis management;customized results presentation;document content navigation;general queries;incremental matching;information filtering;information gathering;information navigation;information presentation;information systems;large-scale information sources;medical digital library;medical information systems;pre-defined domain;scenario-based proxies;scenario-specific information retrieval;semantic links;similarity links;user models;user-tailored information retrieval","Database Management Systems;Information Storage and Retrieval;Libraries, Medical","7","8","46","","","June 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Mobile agents and their use for information retrieval: a brief overview and an elaborate case study","R. H. Glitho; E. Olougouna; S. Pierre","Ericsson Res., Montreal, Que., Canada","IEEE Network","20020807","2002","16","1","34","41","Mobile agents emerged in the mid-1990s, and have raised considerable interest in the research community. The proponents associate several benefits with their use. However, there are still very few quantitative measurements to back the claimed benefits. This article is devoted to mobile agents and their use for information retrieval. We provide a brief overview and an elaborate case study. The overview introduces the concept of mobile agent, enumerates the claimed benefits, and reviews the hindrances to widescale deployment. It also discusses the state of the art of mobile-agent-based information retrieval, including the very few quantitative studies that exist. Our case study is on information retrieval from electronic calendars for multiparty event scheduling. Many events require the participation of several parties. Prior knowledge of the date when most (if not all) targeted participants are available is often a prerequisite for scheduling them. However, identifying this date can easily turn into a nightmare, especially when the number of targeted participants is large. Nowadays, electronic agendas (e.g., MS Outlook) are stored on servers. An application can access them, retrieve information on the availability of the targeted participants, and derive the date from the information. In the case study, a mobile agent is dispatched in the network, instead of retrieving the information using the client/server paradigm. The agent visits the servers, accesses the agendas, retrieves the information, and identifies the date. Finding a date suitable for several potential participants may require the rescheduling of some events that have been previously arranged by some participants. We propose the use of agents that act as the personal agents of the participants for the negotiation inherent to this rescheduling. The measurements we have made indicate clearly that the mobile-agent-based approach outperforms its client/server counterpart even when the latter is optimized. These results can easily be transposed to most information retrieval applications, and demonstrate, for this specific application domain, the performance benefit associated with mobile agents. We now dispatch a single agent in the network. In the future, we will dispatch several agents","0890-8044;08908044","","10.1109/65.980543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=980543","","Calendars;Computer aided software engineering;Information retrieval;Mobile agents;Multiagent systems;Network servers;Prototypes;Scheduling;Videoconference","client-server systems;information retrieval;local area networks;performance evaluation;software agents","Ethernet LAN;MS Outlook;client/server paradigm;electronic agendas;electronic calendars;information retrieval;mobile agents;multiparty event scheduling;network load data analysis;personal agents","","34","1","21","","","Jan/Feb 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the scenarios considered, a large quantity of information is to be stored on some physical storage device. Requests for information are modeled as a randomly generated sequence with a known distribution. The requests are assumed to be “context-dependent,” i.e., to vary according to the sequence of previous requests. The state of the physical storage device is also assumed to depend on the history of previous requests. In general, the logical structure of the information to be stored does not match the physical structure of the storage device, and consequently there are nontrivial limits on the minimum achievable average access times, where the average is over the possible sequences of user requests. The paper applies basic information-theoretic methods to establish these limits and demonstrates constructive procedures that approach them, for a wide class of systems. Allowing redundancy greatly lowers the achievable access times, even when the amount added is an arbitrarily small fraction of the total amount of information in the database. The achievable limits both with and without redundancy are computed; in the case where redundancy is allowed the limits essentially coincide with lower limits for more general storage systems","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/18.887844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887844","","Communication systems;Conferences;History;Image databases;Image storage;Information retrieval;Information science;Information theory;Instruments;Software libraries","database theory;information retrieval;information theory;redundancy","context-dependent requests;databases;distribution;general model;general storage systems;information retrieval;information-theoretic methods;logical structure;minimum achievable average access times;performance limits;previous requests history;randomly generated sequence;redundancy;requests;storage device","","0","","49","","","Nov 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As shown in this paper, this representation can be used for a large number of processing goals such as filtering, segmentation, information retrieval and visual browsing. Furthermore, the processing of the tree representation leads to very efficient algorithms.

However recent research results in the database literature reveal that a curious problem happens in high dimensional space. Since high dimensional space has a high degree of freedom, points could be scattered so that every distance between them might yield no significant difference. In this case, we can say that the NN is indistinctive because many points exist at the similar distance. To make matters worse, indistinctive NNs require more search cost because search completes only after choosing the NN from plenty of strong candidates. In order to circumvent the handful effect of indistinctive NNs, the paper presents a new NN search algorithm which determines the distinctiveness of the NN during search operation. This enables us not only to cut down search cost but also to distinguish distinctive NNs from indistinctive ones.

With the advent of E-commerce and corporate intranets/extranets, these repositories are expected to grow at a fast pace. This explosive growth has led to huge, fragmented, and unstructured document collections. Although it has become easier to collect and store information in document collections, it has become increasingly difficult to retrieve relevant information from these large document collections. This paper addresses the issue of improving retrieval performance (in terms of precision and recall) for retrieval from document collections. There are three important paradigms of research in the area of information retrieval (1R): Probabilistic IR, Knowledge-based IR, and, Artificial Intelligence based techniques like neural networks and symbolic learning. Very few researcher have tried to use evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms (GAs). Previous attempts at using GAs have concentrated on modifying document representations or modifying query representations. This work looks at the possibility of applying GAs to adapt various matching functions. It is hoped that such an adaptation of the matching functions in lead to a better retrieval performance than that obtained by using a single matching function. An overall matching function is treated as an weighted combination of scores produced by individual matching functions. This overall score is asked to rank and retrieve documents. Weights associated with individual functions are searched using Genetic Algorithms. The idea is tested on a real document collection called the Cranfield collection. The results look very encouraging.","","POD:0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926653","","Adaptive arrays;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Costs;Electronic switching systems;Extranets;Genetic algorithms;Information retrieval;Read only memory;Testing","genetic algorithms;information retrieval","document repositories;genetic algorithms;information retrieval;large document collections;matching functions adaptation;neural networks;retrieval performance;symbolic learning","","26","11","30","","","4-7 Jan. 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many applications of SAR (differential) interferometry lead to a set of sparse phase measurements, e.g. the monitoring of permanent scatterers. In this case, the atmospheric phase screen component of a given SAR image can be estimated over the PS sparse grid. Usually such data have to be unwrapped and then interpolated on a regular grid.

The index provides a mapping from search terms to documents. The Binary Neural Associative Memory (BiNAM) stores an index by associating document signatures and document locations in a distributed and content addressable way. The system presented here has a high memory efficiency of more than 90%. The trade-off between memory consumption and precision of the query-results is examined. A scalable system architecture is presented. The architecture exploits the parallel structure of the BiNAM. The association time is estimated to be orders of magnitude faster than a software solution. The system is realized as a modular PCI architecture. The maximum capacity of the first version is 768 MByte memory which allows to implement a BiNAM of 80 K neurons with 80 K inputs each.

In this paper, we describe an information retrieval language in which the formalized domain knowledge and the attached textual information can be accessed in an integrated fashion and can be used to define various retrieval schemes and relevance measures. This language on the one hand provides maximum flexibility for knowledge engineers to exploit the available annotated domain model as contextual information. On the other hand, it allows the definition of complex, high-level queries, in which the contextual use of the annotated domain model can be optimized for clinical situations.

"Cost effective mobile agent planning for distributed information retrieval","Jin-Wook Baek; Jae-Heung Yeo; Gyu-Tae Kim; Heon-Young Yeom","Sch. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Seoul Nat. Univ., South Korea","Proceedings 21st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","20020807","2001","","","65","72","The number of agents and the execution time are two significant performance factors in mobile agent planning (MAP). Fewer agents cause lower network traffic and consume less bandwidth. Regardless of the number of agents used, the execution time for a task must be kept minimal, which means that use of the minimal number of agents must not impact on the execution time unfavorably. As the population of the mobile agent application domain grows, the importance of these two factors also increases. After a careful review of these two factors, we propose two heuristic algorithms for finding the minimal number of traveling agents for retrieving information from a distributed computing environment, while keeping the latency minimal. Although agent planning, specifically MAP, is quite similar to the famous traveling salesman problem (TSP), agent planning has a different objective function from that of TSP. TSP deals with the optimal total routing cost, while MAP attempts to minimize the execution time to complete tasks of information retrieval. In this paper, we suggest two cost-effective MAP algorithms, BYKY1 (Baek-Yeo-Kim-Yeom 1) and BYKY2, which can be used in distributed information retrieval systems to find the factors mentioned above. At the end of each algorithm, 2OPT, a well-known TSP algorithm, is called to optimize each agent's local routing path. Experimental results show that BYKY2 produces near-optimal performance.

This image retrieval method extracts color features and their location information included in an image. A neural network tries to find images with similar features from a data set. First, images are translated into gray-scale ones and then are divided into eight regions based on gray-scale values. The color and location features are extracted from these regions after integration of regions. The RGB and HSV color values in each region, area, and the X- and Y-values in the orthogonal coordinates are learned by a multi-layered neural network.

Because the QRS works transparently over the multimedia system, legacy multimedia systems can cooperate with one another using the QRS. This means that the QRS allows users to not only retrieve multimedia information from a network, but also to use various kinds of search engines without any special operations.

Since term-by-document matrices are usually high-dimensional and sparse, they are susceptible to noise and are also difficult to capture the underlying semantic structure. Additionally, the storage and processing of such matrices places great demands on computing resources. Dimensionality reduction is a way to overcome these problems. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are popular techniques for dimensionality reduction based on matrix decomposition, however they contain both positive and negative values in the decomposed matrices. In the work described here, we use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for dimensionality reduction of the vector space model. Since matrices decomposed by NMF only contain non-negative values, the original data are represented by only additive, not subtractive, combinations of the basis vectors. This characteristic of parts-based representation is appealing because it reflects the intuitive notion of combining parts to form a whole. Also NMF computation is based on the simple iterative algorithm, it is therefore advantageous for applications involving large matrices.

The authors present a two-axial signature based method of retrieving similar images based on color-spatial information for the design of an image search engine on the Internet. Two kinds of signatures, a dominant color composition (DCC) signature and a set of dominant color distribution (DCD) signatures are extracted from an image to represent the color-spatial information. In particular, DCD signatures are generated by projecting positions of each subregion with its own dominant color on the horizontal and vertical axis after partitioning an image area into n/spl times/n subregions. The DCC signature is used to prune away irrelevant images to a given image query, before evaluating the more expensive similarity measure on prospective candidate images. The spatial similarity of dominant colors is evaluated using the DCD signature. Experiments are performed on an image database of over 6000 images with our prototype system which adopts DCC and DCD signatures as index key for color-spatial image retrieval. Our results show the retrieval robustness for images that are partially rotated, transformed, and sub-sampled.","","POD:0-7695-0577-5","10.1109/WISE.2000.882416","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=882416","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Internet;Prototypes;Search engines","content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;indexing;information resources;search engines;visual databases","DCC signature;DCD signatures;Internet;Web applications;color-spatial image retrieval;color-spatial information;content based image retrieval;dominant color;dominant color composition;dominant color distribution;dominant colors;image database;image query;image search engine;indexing scheme;irrelevant images;prospective candidate images;retrieval robustness;signature representation;similar image retrieval;similarity measure;spatial similarity;subregion;two-axial signature based method","","1","","17","","","19-21 June 2000","19 Jun 2000-21 Jun 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, most user models are constructed in a specialized form that is not applied to other systems or domains. This specialization makes it difficult to share user models as common resources for developing information retrieval systems and for researching cognitive characteristics in various users. In order to solve this problem, we need a general user modeling method. A user model based on a probabilistic framework is proposed. We call this model a generative user model. The generative user model represents user's mental depth by latent (hidden) variables. It also has visible variables that mean word set and qualifier of each word as a subjective probability distribution. The model can handle uncertainty of the user's subjectivity by a probabilistic framework. Recent statistical studies for such latent models give a learning algorithm. Our generative user model can be constructed from a dataset taken by information retrieval tasks. As an example, we also introduce two different kinds of information retrieval systems, ART MUSEUM (Multimedia Database with Sense of Color and Construction upon the Matter of ART) and DSIU (Decision Support for Internet Users).

Linear optimization queries ask for top-N records subject to the maximisation or minimization of a linearly weighted sum of record attribute values. Such a query appears in many applications employing linear models and is an effective way of summarising representative cases, such as the top-50 ranked colleges. Onion indexing is based on a geometric property of a convex hull, which guarantees that the optimal value can always be found at one or more of its vertices. Onion indexing makes use of this property to construct convex hulls in layers with outer layers enclosing inner layers geometrically. A data record is indexed by its layer number or equivalently its depth in the layered convex hull. Queries with linear weightings issued at run time are evaluated from the outmost layer inwards. We show experimentally that Onion indexing achieves orders of magnitude speedup against sequential linear scan when N is small compared to the cardinality of the set. The Onion technique also enables progressive retrieval, which processes and returns ranked results in a progressive manner. Furthermore, the proposed indexing can be extended into a hierarchical organization of data to accommodate both global and local queries","","POD:0-7803-6536-4","10.1109/ICME.2000.869615","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869615","","Cities and towns;Databases;Diseases;Educational institutions;Indexing;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Neural networks;Q factor;Vectors","indexing;information retrieval;optimisation","Onion indexing;convex hull;data record;geometric property;global queries;linear model-based information retrieval;linear optimization queries;linear weightings;linearly weighted record attribute value sum;local queries;maximisation;minimization;progressive retrieval;sequential linear scan;top-N records;vertices","","0","1","13","","","2000","30 Jul 2000-02 Aug 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The knowledge base is represented by a multi-relationship fuzzy concept network that can depict the relationships and their associating relevance degrees between concepts clearly. Based on the multi-relationship fuzzy concept network architecture, the users of the fuzzy information retrieval system can submit a fuzzy contextual query that specifies the search context in the query formula. The fuzzy information retrieval system retrieves documents whose contents are relevant to the user's query by some required relationships beneath a specified search context. The proposed fuzzy information retrieval method is more intelligent and more flexible than the existing methods since it can automatically construct knowledge bases (i.e, multi-relationship fuzzy concept networks) and it provides contextual search capability that allows users to specify fuzzy contextual queries in a more flexible manner.","","POD:0-7803-7293-X","10.1109/FUZZ.2001.1009027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1009027","","Computer networks;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Information retrieval;Information science;Intelligent networks","fuzzy logic;information retrieval systems;knowledge based systems","contextual search capability;fuzzy contextual query;fuzzy information retrieval systems;knowledge base;multi-relationship fuzzy concept networks;multirelationship fuzzy concept network;search context","","0","","8","","","2-5 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With easy ability to synchronize content from the Web with handheld systems, basic Web design assumptions should be reexamined to determine how handhelds affect search and retrieval. The small screen size, text-based design, and cumbersome interface manipulation requires verification of the current design guidelines to ensure they support efficient information retrieval. In addition, PDA users' browsing behavior also differs from typical Web use. Whereas people using the Web tend to engage in open-ended exploratory behaviors, PDAs are intended to support task-specific use. Thus user ability to retrieve information-including locating and relocating information, building mental models of the Web site, and remembering the information once the user has found it-may differ in substantive ways.

We use this framework to guide hidden annotations in order to improve the retrieval performance. For each object in the database, we maintain a list of probabilities, each indicating the probability of this object having one of the attributes. During training, the learning algorithm samples objects in the database and presents them to the annotator to assign attributes. For each sampled object, each probability is set to be one or zero depending on whether or not the corresponding attribute is assigned by the annotator. For objects that have not been annotated, the learning algorithm estimates their probabilities with biased kernel regression. Knowledge gain is then defined to determine, among the objects that have not been annotated, which one the system is the most uncertain. The system then presents it as the next sample to the annotator to which it is assigned attributes. During retrieval, the list of probabilities works as a feature vector for us to calculate the semantic distance between two objects, or between the user query and an object in the database. The overall distance between two objects is determined by a weighted sum of the semantic distance and the low-level feature distance. The algorithm is tested on both synthetic databases and real databases of 3D models. In both cases, the retrieval performance of the system improves rapidly with the number of annotated samples. Furthermore, we show that active learning outperforms learning based on random sampling.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2002.1017738","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017738","","Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Kernel;Probability;Spatial databases;Testing","content-based retrieval;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);object-oriented databases;query processing;relevance feedback","active learning;content-based information retrieval;database;feature distance;knowledge gain;probability;random sampling;semantic distance","","61","3","32","","","Jun 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To support this capability, MIRE enhances the processing algorithms of an existing multidimensional access method to avoid overflow and support for hierarchical dimensions.

The intelligent methodology to fuse agents' decisions, the team consensus approach, models the interaction and bring a society into a consensus. After each agent in the group gathers information relevant to a user's query, the group engages in an uncertainty estimation stage. This process allows each agent to assess its self-uncertainty and the conditional uncertainties of other agents. The procedure facilitates the computation of a weighting scheme that operates recursively on information collected by these agents until the group reaches a consensus. Whenever a new task is received, the uncertainty estimates of agent are updated and used to compute a new weighting scheme.","","POD:0-9721844-1-4","10.1109/ICIF.2002.1020957","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1020957","","Fuses;Information filtering;Information management;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Internet;Multiagent systems;Uncertainty;Web sites;World Wide Web","information networks;information retrieval;multi-agent systems;sensor fusion","Web information retrieval;cooperative multiagent system;decision fusion;fusion technique;information fusion;intelligent methodology;multiagent system;uncertainty estimates","","2","","13","","","8-11 July 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

AURA (Advanced Uncertain Reasoning Architecture) is a generic family of techniques and implementations intended for high-speed approximate search and match operations on large unstructured datasets. AURA technology is fast, economical, and offers unique advantages for finding near-matches not available with other methods. AURA is based upon a high-performance binary neural network called a correlation matrix memory (CMM). Typically, several CMM elements are used in combination to solve soft or fuzzy pattern-matching problems. AURA takes large volumes of data and constructs a special type of compressed index. AURA finds exact and near-matches between indexed records and a given query, where the query itself may have omissions and errors. The degree of nearness required during matching can be varied through thresholding techniques. The PCI-based PRESENCE (Parallel Structured Neural Computing Engine) card is a hardware-accelerator architecture for the core CMM computations needed in AURA-based applications. The card is designed for use in low-cost workstations and incorporates 128 MByte of low-cost DRAM for CMM storage. To investigate the scalability of the distributed AURA system, we implement a word-to-document index of an AURA-based information retrieval system, called MinerTaur, over a distributed PRESENCE CMM.","1082-8907;10828907","POD:0-7695-1686-6","10.1109/HPDC.2002.1029953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1029953","","Aircraft;Artificial neural networks;Computer architecture;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Coordinate measuring machines;Environmental economics;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Scalability","indexing;inference mechanisms;information retrieval systems;neural nets;parallel architectures;pattern matching;reconfigurable architectures;uncertainty handling;workstation clusters","128 MByte;AURA;Advanced Uncertain Reasoning Architecture;DRAM;MinerTaur;PCI-based PRESENCE card;Parallel Structured Neural Computing Engine;compressed index;correlation matrix memory;distributed neural information retrieval system;exact matches;fuzzy pattern matching problems;hardware-accelerator architecture;high-performance binary neural network;high-speed approximate match operations;high-speed approximate search operations;indexed records;large unstructured datasets;low-cost workstations;near-matches;query;scalability;soft pattern matching problems;thresholding techniques;word-to-document index","","2","","4","","","24-26 July 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A distributed database environment with a WWW interface is presented and used as a generic implementation platform for this technique.

We consider the use of mobile agent technology rather than traditional client-server computing for information retrieval by mobile and wireless users in a virtual enterprise. We argue that to be successful mobile agent platforms must coexist with, and be presented to the applications programmer side-by-side with, traditional client-server middleware like CORBA and DOOM, and we sketch a middleware architecture for doing so. We then develop an analytical model that examines the claimed performance benefits of mobile agents over client-server computing for a mobile information retrieval scenario. Our evaluation of the model shows that mobile agents are not always better than client-server calls in terms of average response times; they are only beneficial if the space overhead of the mobile agent code is not too large or if the wireless link connecting the mobile user to the fixed servers of the virtual enterprise is error-prone","","POD:0-7695-0628-3","10.1109/AIWORC.2000.843295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=843295","","Analytical models;Computer architecture;Delay;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Middleware;Mobile agents;Mobile computing;Programming profession;Virtual enterprises","business data processing;client-server systems;distributed object management;distributed programming;information retrieval;mobile computing;software agents;wireless LAN","CORBA;DOOM;average response time;client-server systems;information retrieval;middleware;mobile agent;next-generation enterprises;portable devices;virtual enterprises;wireless devices","","8","","13","","","2000","27 Apr 2000-29 Apr 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
