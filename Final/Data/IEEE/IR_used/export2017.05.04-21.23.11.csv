There is no precedent in the amazing amount of information, especially network news, that can be accessed by Internet users these days. As a result, the problem of seeking information in online news articles is not the lack of them but being overwhelmed by them. This brings huge challenges in processing online news feeds, e.g., how to determine which news article is important, how to determine the quality of each news article, and how to filter irrelevant and redundant information. In this paper, we propose a method for filtering redundant and less-informative RSS news articles that solves the problem of excessive number of news feeds observed in RSS news aggregators. Our filtering approach measures similarity among RSS news entries by using the fuzzy-set information retrieval model and a fuzzy equivalent relation for computing word/sentence similarity to detect redundant and less-informative news articles","1082-3409;10823409","POD:0-7695-2728-0","10.1109/ICTAI.2006.54","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4031932","","Computer science;Feeds;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Internet;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Portals","Internet;information filtering;information resources;word processing","Internet;fuzzy equivalence relation;fuzzy equivalent relation;fuzzy set information retrieval model;irrelevant information filtering;less-informative news article;network news feeds;news aggregator;news entry;online news article;online news feeds;redundant information filtering;redundant news article;sentence similarity;word similarity","","2","4","16","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here we propose a new pragmatic architectural model using Web services as building blocks, to form an inter-enterprise integration platform for e-commerce. The key idea is to separate the view of a Web service defined by its provider from the views of this Web service employed by consumers. Based on this principle, we explain the use of Web service mediators which act on behalf of both service providers and consumers. We advance the notion of requester-based views of a Web service, which are published by a mediator and used by service providers to construct services that suit the consumer. To complement those, we use customer-oriented global views which express the information need of a customer. IEIP architecture improves on traditional data and enterprise service integration systems. It achieves the following two goals: a customer can use its own (private) view to access a number of different Web services, as it is using a global view; and a provider can provide one view for a service implementation that can be accessed by different requesters using different global views. Leveraging this model, we report on a prototype supporting a European-wide parking services platform that integrates data and services from a large number of parking providers","","POD:0-7695-2737-X","10.1109/ECOWS.2006.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4031164","","Access protocols;Application software;Databases;Information retrieval;Information systems;Mediation;Prototypes;Web and internet services;Web services","Web services;electronic commerce;information needs;information retrieval;open systems;virtual enterprises","European-wide parking service platform;Web service mediation;cross-platform interoperability;customer information needs;e-commerce;enterprise service integration;heterogeneous systems;interenterprise integration platform;parking providers;pragmatic architectural model;service consumers;service providers","","1","","44","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The heart of this approach is the Markov model that is built upon this graph, which assigns an outlier score to each object. Using this framework, we show that our algorithm is more powerful than the existing outlier detection schemes and can effectively address the inherent problems of such schemes.

We propose a system called metric network for enterprise-wide business performance monitoring and analysis. A metric network consists of metrics, metric repositories, aggregation agents, and knowledge agents.

Mi-Winnow is different from existing multiple-instance learning algorithms in several key ways. First, Mi-Winnow allows each image to be converted into a bag in multiple ways to create training (and test) data that varies in both the number of dimensions per point, and in the kind of features used. Second, instead of learning a concept defined by a single point-and-scaling hypothesis, Mi-Winnow allows the underlying concept to be described by combining a set of separators learned by Winnow.

This is largely due to the capability of inter-query approach to enable learning from the retrieval patterns of previous query sessions. However, much of the research works in this field have been focusing on analyzing image retrieval patterns stored in the database. This is not suitable for a dynamic environment such as the World Wide Web (WWW) where images are constantly added or removed. A better alternative is to use an image's visual features to capture the knowledge gained from the previous query sessions. Based on the previous work (Chung et al., 2006), the aim of this paper is to propose a framework of inter-query learning for the WWW-CBIR systems.

Though the classification of audio into single type such as music, speech, environmental sound and silence is well studied, classification of mixed type audio data, such as clips having speech with music as background, is still considered a difficult problem. In this paper, we present a mixed type audio classification system based on support vector machine (SVM).

In this paper we show that Web services technologies have more to offer to the network management discipline than just bridging established network management protocols and Web services protocols. Particularly we explore the possibility of using Web services composition applied to network management. If successful, Web services composition can bring to network management the solution for some key problems yet to be solved, such as retrieving the information from several different devices and yet being able to use a simple and fast interface at the manager side. We present Web services composition for network management considering two approaches: in the first one a single network device needs to be contacted and its information composed; in the second one, many devices need to be contacted and the information retrieved from them need to be composed.

Our system is based on a template-matching method that uses power spectrograms of drum sounds as templates. This method calculates the distance between a template and each spectrogram segment extracted from a song spectrogram, using Goto's distance measure originally designed to detect the onsets in drums-only signals. However, there are two main problems. The first problem is that appropriate templates are unknown for each song. The second problem is that it is more difficult to detect drum-sound onsets in sound mixtures including various sounds other than drum sounds. To solve these problems, we propose template-adaptation and harmonic-structure-suppression methods. First of all, an initial template of each drum sound, called a seed template, is prepared. The former method adapts it to actual drum-sound spectrograms appearing in the song spectrogram. To make our system robust to the overlapping of harmonic sounds with drum sounds, the latter method suppresses harmonic components in the song spectrogram before the adaptation and matching. Experimental results with 70 popular songs showed that our template-adaptation and harmonic-structure-suppression methods improved the recognition accuracy and achieved 83%, 58%, and 46% in detecting onsets of the bass drum, snare drum, and hi-hat cymbals, respectively","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2006.876754","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4032798","Drum sound recognition;harmonic structure suppression;polyphonic audio signal;spectrogram template;template adaptation;template matching","Acoustic signal detection;Adaptive signal detection;Content based retrieval;Information analysis;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Rhythm;Signal design;Spectrogram","acoustic signal processing;audio acoustics;audio signal processing;harmonics suppression;musical instruments","bass drum;drum sound recognition;drum-sound spectrograms;harmonic sounds;harmonic structure suppression;harmonic-structure-suppression methods;hi-hat cymbals;polyphonic audio signals;snare drum;song spectrogram;spectrogram templates;template-matching method","","14","3","34","","","Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The cost includes the transmission cost for file update and file read, as well as the storage cost. We show that such a problem can be transformed into a pure flow problem and is solvable in polynomial time using linear programming. Coding is often necessary for obtaining the optimal solution with the minimum cost. However, we prove that for networks of generalized tree structures, where adjacent nodes can have asymmetric links between them, file splitting instead of coding - is sufficient for achieving optimality. In particular, if there is no constraint on the numbers of bits that can be stored in storage nodes, there exists an optimal solution that always transmits and stores the file as a whole.

Indeed, these values are preserved in case of illumination changes and they take into account both the colors of the pixels and the spatial interactions between them in the image. Since we can not determine these ranks from a color image, we propose to estimate their probabilities of occurrences thanks to fuzzy functions.

The dynamic system management server is duplicated in order to keep the system robust, and has an assistant management server. The dynamic system management server has a function of the job execution system management, including software deployment, program compilation, job execution, job status retrieval and computing data retrieval.

After the submitted job finishes, the dynamic system management server collects the information from other distributed computers. The dynamic management server and its assistant server move dynamically to new servers, if the present servers become busy. The dynamic system management server also demands the execution server to transfer the result data to the optimal data server. The dynamic system management server copies the computing data and sends the compressed computing data to another optimal data server in order for a robust data storage system. The clients can deploy their programs, execute jobs and retrieve the result data by accessing only the web page in the job execution service system.

For the commercial success of these services, the ability to deliver good end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) is crucial. Today, no mature solutions exist for the problem of realizing high and guaranteed end-to-end QoS for transaction-based services in multi-domain environments. Service level agreements (SLAs) are a well-recognized concept to obtain QoS guarantees, but currently no satisfactory solutions exist for SPs to determine the set of combinations of per-domain SLAs that they need to negotiate with the other domain owners to deliver the desired end-to-end QoS. To this end, in this paper we introduce the new concept called SLA negotiation space, i.e. the set of combinations of per-domain SLAs that SPs need to negotiate with other domain owners to realize desired end-to-end QoS levels. In addition, to identify the SLA negotiation space, we propose a modelling framework to quantify the complex relation between the per-domain SLA parameters and the end-to-end QoS.

Such data integration raises challenging issues: (1) Support for multiple independently-managed schemas, (2) Ease of schema evolution, and (3) Simple schema mappings. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel approach to semantic integration of scientific data which uses XML schemas and RDF-based schema mappings.

R-trees, R*-trees and (B)UB-trees are representatives of the vector data structures. These data structures provide efficient processing of many types of queries, i.e. point queries, range queries and so on. As far as the vector data structures are concerned, the range query retrieves all points in defined hyper box in an n-dimensional space. The narrow range query is an important type of the range query. Its processing is inefficient in vector data structures. Moreover, the efficiency decreases as the dimension of the indexed space increases. We depict an application of the signature for more efficient processing of narrow range queries. The approach puts the signature into the multi-dimensional data structures like R-tree or UB-tree but original functionalities are preserved, i.e. the range query algorithm for general range query.

In this report, we are especially interested in documents with relative time order, which we also call document streams. Examples include TV news, forums, emails of company projects, call center telephone logs, etc. To get an insight into these document streams, first we need to detect the events among the document streams. We use a time-sensitive Dirichlet process mixture model to find the events in the document streams. A time sensitive Dirichlet process mixture model is a generative model, which allows a potentially infinite number of mixture components and uses a Dirichlet compound multinomial model to model the distribution of words in documents. In this report, we consider three different time sensitive Dirichlet process mixture models: an exponential decay kernel model, a polynomial decay function kernel Dirichlet process model and a sliding window kernel model. Experiments on the TDT2 dataset have shown that the time sensitive models perform 18-20% better in terms of accuracy than the Dirichlet process mixture model. The sliding windows kernel and the polynomial kernel are more promising in detecting events. We use ThemeRiver to provide a visualization of the events along the time axis. With the help of ThemeRiver, people can easily get an overall picture of how different events evolve. Besides ThemeRiver, we investigate using top words as a high-level summarization of each event.

In this paper, we present SPyRO (simple Python remote objects) which is a Python remote object management system developed to provide transparent and translucent remote object access. The transparent mode is designed to create easily distributed applications supporting code mobility (Fuggetta et al., 1998) in Python programming language, whilst the translucent mode is designed to provide total control over remote calls, and allow access from other programming languages. To lower the communication latency, the connection is stateless, local objects and remote calls are not aware of the connection state. The protocol uses several marshal formats to communicate between peers, trying to maximize the homogeneity in a heterogeneous network.

A major problem of adding such equivalences is that they may result in intransitivity of the aggregated Pareto order and thus efficient query processing is hampered. In this paper we analyze how far the strict Pareto semantics can be relaxed while always retaining transitivity of the induced Pareto aggregation.

The proposed mechanism shows advantage over traditional relevance feedback methods in the following three aspects. Firstly, instead of enforcing the users to make explicit judgment on the results, our method regards user's click-through data as implicit relevance feedback which release burden from users. Secondly, a hierarchical image search results clustering algorithm is proposed to semantically organize the search results. Using the clustering results as features, our relevance feedback scheme could catch and reflect users' search intention precisely.

They will store structured media information in the form of multimedia documents (MMDs). One major problem in implementing these libraries is data integration, since different multimedia data types use different data models and structures to represent and store the information. We use (a) XML schema and MPEG-7 content description standards for structural and content-based modeling of MMDs and (b) the object-relational (OR) data model as a unified approach for representation, storage, and retrieval of structured MMDs.

Recent works have demonstrated that this approach is not sufficient to discover relevant components. In this paper we argue that, in many situations, the service discovery should be based on the specification of service behavior (in particular, the conversation protocol). The idea behind is to develop matching techniques that operate on behavior models and allow delivery of partial matches and evaluation of semantic distance between these matches and the user requirements. Consequently, even if a service satisfying exactly the user requirements does not exist, the most similar ones will be retrieved and proposed for reuse by extension or modification. To do so, we reduce the problem of behavioral matching to a graph matching problem and we adapt existing algorithms for this purpose. A prototype is presented (available as a Web service) which takes as input two conversation protocols and evaluates the semantic distance between them; the prototype provides also the script of edit operations that can be used to alter the first model to render it identical with the second one","","POD:0-7695-2669-1","10.1109/ICWS.2006.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4032022","behavioral matching;services retrieval;web services","Application software;Character generation;Context-aware services;Grid computing;Impedance matching;Information retrieval;Protocols;Prototypes;Telematics;Web services","Web services","Web services;behavioral matchmaking;conversation protocol;graph matching;service discovery;service retrieval","","19","","24","","","18-22 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The developers and users who are accustomed to making queries to retrieve a particular multimedia item from a large scale database can be frustrated by the long query times. Conventional indexing structures cannot usually cope with the requirements of a multimedia database, such as dynamic indexing or the presence of high-dimensional audiovisual features. Such structures do not scale well with the ever increasing size of multimedia databases whilst inducing corruption and resulting in an over-crowded indexing structure. This paper addresses such problems and presents a novel indexing technique, hierarchical cellular tree (HCT), which is designed to bring an effective solution especially for indexing large multimedia databases. Furthermore it provides an enhanced browsing capability, which enables user to make a guided tour within the database. A pre-emptive cell-search mechanism is introduced in order to prevent corruption, which may occur due to erroneous item insertions. Among the hierarchical levels that are built in a bottom-up fashion, similar items are collected into appropriate cellular structures at some level. Cells are subject to mitosis operations when the dissimilarity exceeds a required level. By mitosis operations, cells are kept focused and compact and yet, they can grow into any dimension as long as the compactness is maintained. The proposed indexing scheme is then used along with a recently introduced query method, the progressive query, in order to achieve the ultimate goal, from the user point of view that is retrieval of the most relevant items in the earliest possible time regardless of the database size. Experimental results show that the speed of retrievals is significantly improved and the indexing structure shows no sign of degradations when the database size is increased. Furthermore, HCT ind- exing body can conveniently be used for efficient browsing and navigation operations among the multimedia database items","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2006.886362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4032612","Content-based retrieval;metric access methods;multimedia databases;similarity-based indexing","Content based retrieval;Degradation;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Spatial databases;Visual databases","content-based retrieval;database indexing;multimedia databases;tree data structures","content-based retrieval;hierarchical cellular tree;mitosis operation;multimedia database;multimedia indexing structure","","19","","42","","","Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In data extraction, the modified clusters are retrieved first, and other operations are the inverse process of the data hiding. The original model can be perfectly recovered if it is intact. Our scheme is suitable for some specific applications where content accuracy of the original model must be guaranteed.

Historically film production techniques, have developed, in part, to convey e.g. meaning or atmosphere to the viewer. By studying these techniques, established guidelines for conveying meaning may be incorporated into automated tools for video analysis. In the current paper we present an approach in this area to classify different shot types, such as long shots, medium shots and close ups, which are important elements of video production. Based on a set of features calculated from the audiovisual content (e.g. presence of camera motion and size of detected faces), a Bayesian classifier distinguishes between six different shot types. The performance of this novel generic field of view classifier in terms of precision and recall is promising","1945-7871;19457871","CD-ROM:1-4244-0367-7; POD:1-4244-0366-7","10.1109/ICME.2006.262854","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4036923","","Atmosphere;Audio databases;Cameras;Face detection;Guidelines;Gunshot detection systems;Indexes;Information retrieval;Production;Uninterruptible power systems","Bayes methods;audio databases;audio-visual systems;image classification;video databases;video signal processing","Bayesian classifier;audiovisual database;automatic system;video classification","","0","1","12","","","9-12 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has been defined as ""the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces"" (Thomas and Cook, 2005). Visual analytic environments, therefore, support analytical reasoning using visual representations and interactions, with data representations and transformation capabilities, to support production, presentation, and dissemination. As researchers begin to develop visual analytic environments, it is advantageous to develop metrics and methodologies to help researchers measure the progress of their work and understand the impact their work has on the users who work in such environments. This paper presents five areas or aspects of visual analytic environments that should be considered as metrics and methodologies for evaluation are developed. Evaluation aspects need to include usability, but it is necessary to go beyond basic usability. The areas of situation awareness, collaboration, interaction, creativity, and utility are proposed as the five evaluation areas for initial consideration. The steps that need to be undertaken to develop systematic evaluation methodologies and metrics for visual analytic environments are outlined","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0592-0; POD:1-4244-0591-2","10.1109/VAST.2006.261416","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4035759","analytic environments;metrics;visualization","Collaborative work;Hardware;Humans;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Production;Speech recognition;Usability;Visual analytics;Visualization","data analysis;data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;interactive systems","analytical reasoning;collaboration;creativity;evaluation metrics;interaction;interactive visual interfaces;situation awareness;usability;utility;visual analytic environments;visual representations","","17","","26","","","Oct. 31 2006-Nov. 2 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we consider ontology as knowledge structure that specifies concepts and their semantic relations. And we propose a fuzzy similarity measure for not only atomic concepts with inclusion relation but also complex concepts with semantic relation. This fuzzy similarity measure has property of weak fuzzy similarity relation, which conquers existing limitations of equivalence relation. Furthermore, this fuzzy similarity measure based on shared information content could reflect latent semantic relation of concepts better than ever","","POD:0-7695-2751-5","10.1109/APSCC.2006.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041204","","Atomic measurements;Computer science;Fuzzy sets;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Taxonomy;Vocabulary;Web services","Web services;fuzzy set theory;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","Web services composition;Web services discovery;fuzzy similarity measure;ontology","","0","","22","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This semantic similarity score is used by AI planning algorithms to guide the searching process when composing services. Experimental results indicate that planning with semantic matching produces better results than planning or semantic matching alone.

Cryptographic separation protects information in transmission and storage. Formally proven properties of separation kernel based secure virtualization can bound risk for information in processing. Then, within each strongly separated domain, risk can be measured as a function of people and technology within that domain. Where hardware, software, and their interactions are proven to behave as and only as desired under all circumstances, such hardware and software can be considered to not substantially increase risk. Where the size or complexity of software is beyond such formal proofs, we discuss estimating risk related to software defect densities, and emerging work related to binary analysis with potential for improving software defect density estimation.","1063-9527;10639527","POD:0-7695-2716-7","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041166","","Computer security;Cryptography;Disaster management;Financial management;Formal verification;Hardware;Information retrieval;Kernel;Protection;Software systems","","","","0","","37","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
