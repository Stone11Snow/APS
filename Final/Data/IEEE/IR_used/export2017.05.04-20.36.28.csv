One practical approach is supervised binary hashing, where each object is mapped onto a small binary vector so that Hamming distances approximate semantic similarities, and the search is done in the binary space more efficiently. Much work has focused on designing objective functions and optimization algorithms for learning b-bit hash functions from a dataset. Recent work has shown that comparable or better results can be obtained by training b hash functions independently from each other and making them cooperate by introducing diversity with ensemble learning techniques. We show that this can be further improved by two techniques: pruning an ensemble of hash functions, and learning local hash functions. We show how it is possible to train our improved algorithms in datasets orders of magnitude larger than those used by most works on supervised binary hashing.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5473-2; POD:978-1-5090-5474-9","10.1109/ICDM.2016.0155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837968","binary hashing;ensemble diversity;information retrieval;optimization","Binary codes;Databases;Laplace equations;Linear programming;Optimization;Search problems;Training","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;search problems;vectors;very large databases","Hamming distances;approximate search algorithms;b-bit hash function learning;binary space;complex objects;diverse binary hash functions;ensemble learning techniques;information retrieval;large databases;local hash function learning;locality;objective functions;optimization algorithms;pruning;semantic similarities;small binary vector;supervised binary hashing","","","","","","","12-15 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Bag-of-Concepts Document Representation for Bayesian Text Classification","M. Mouriño-García; R. Pérez-Rodríguez; L. Anido-Rifón; M. Gómez-Carballa","Dept. of Telematics Eng., Univ. of Vigo, Vigo, Spain","2016 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)","20170313","2016","","","281","288","The classification of text documents into a number of pre-defined categories has many application scenarios, for example the classification of news items into thematic sections. Documents to be classified are commonly represented by a bag-of-words feature vector. The bag-of-words model cannot handle two language phenomena: synonymy and polysemy, besides, dimensions of feature vectors are orthogonal. In order to effectively address those problems, some researchers adopt a bag-of-concepts representation of documents-understanding concept as ""unit of meaning'"". This paper reports a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the efficiency of a bag-of-concepts representation for Bayesian text classification, tackling synonymy and polysemy, and exploiting semantic relatedness between concepts to alleviate the problem of orthogonality-following an approach that we call semantic expansion. Results of experiments performed on three corpora widely used as benchmarks-Reuters, OHSUMED, and 20Newsgroups-show that: the efficiency of the bag-of-concepts approach is very dependent on the capacity of the semantic annotator for extracting concepts and on the characteristics of particular corpora, peaking on OHSUMED, and that it performs especially well when the number of training samples is small. In particular, for the shorter training sequence bag-of-concepts outperforms bag-of-words by 43.67% in OHSUMED and 22.44% in 20Newsgroups. This work provides useful insights to researchers that aim at applying bag-of-concepts representations, for example for organizing scientific articles in accordance with their thematic.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4314-9; POD:978-1-5090-4315-6","10.1109/CIT.2016.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7876349","bag-of-concepts;bag-of-words;document representation;information retrieval;machine learning;text classification","Bayes methods;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Internet;Semantics;Text categorization","Bayes methods;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;text analysis","20Newsgroups benchmark;Bayesian text document classification;OHSUMED benchmark;Reuters benchmark;bag-of-concepts document representation;bag-of-words feature vector;orthogonality problem;polysemy;scientific article organization;semantic annotator;semantic expansion;semantic relatedness;synonymy;training sequence bag-of-concepts;unit-of-meaning","","","","","","","8-10 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"The Semantic Knowledge Graph: A Compact, Auto-Generated Model for Real-Time Traversal and Ranking of any Relationship within a Domain","T. Grainger; K. Aljadda; M. Korayem; A. Smith","CareerBuilder, Norcross, GA, USA","2016 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)","20161226","2016","","","420","429","This paper describes a new kind of knowledge representation and mining system which we are calling the Semantic Knowledge Graph. At its heart, the Semantic Knowledge Graph leverages an inverted index, along with a complementary uninverted index, to represent nodes (terms) and edges (the documents within intersecting postings lists for multiple terms/nodes). This provides a layer of indirection between each pair of nodes and their corresponding edge, enabling edges to materialize dynamically from underlying corpus statistics. As a result, any combination of nodes can have edges to any other nodes materialize and be scored to reveal latent relationships between the nodes. This provides numerous benefits: the knowledge graph can be built automatically from a real-world corpus of data, new nodes - along with their combined edges - can be instantly materialized from any arbitrary combination of preexisting nodes (using set operations), and a full model of the semantic relationships between all entities within a domain can be represented and dynamically traversed using a highly compact representation of the graph. Such a system has widespread applications in areas as diverse as knowledge modeling and reasoning, natural language processing, anomaly detection, data cleansing, semantic search, analytics, data classification, root cause analysis, and recommendations systems. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel system - the Semantic Knowledge Graph - which is able to dynamically discover and score interesting relationships between any arbitrary combination of entities (words, phrases, or extracted concepts) through dynamically materializing nodes and edges from a compact graphical representation built automatically from a corpus of data representative of a knowledge domain. The source code for our Semantic Knowledge Graph implementation is being published along with this paper to facilitate further research and extensions of this work.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5206-6; POD:978-1-5090-5207-3","10.1109/DSAA.2016.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796928","Anomaly Detection;Graph Compression;Information Retrieval;Knowledge Graph;Natural Language Processing;Ontology Learning;Relationship Extraction;Semantic Search;Text Analytics","Context;Data models;Learning systems;Natural languages;Ontologies;Pragmatics;Semantics","data mining;graph theory;indexing;knowledge representation;semantic Web","anomaly detection;auto-generated model;compact graph representation;compact graphical representation;corpus statistics;data classification;data cleansing;inverted index;knowledge modeling;knowledge representation;mining system;natural language processing;real-time relationship traversal;recommendations systems;relationship ranking;root cause analysis;semantic knowledge graph;semantic search","","","","","","","17-19 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Web-Based Similarity for Emotion Recognition in Web Objects","V. Franzoni; G. Biondi; Y. Li; A. Milani","Dept. of Math. & Comput. Sci., Univ. of Perugia, Perugia, Italy","2016 IEEE/ACM 9th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC)","20170320","2016","","","327","332","In this project we propose a new approach for emotion recognition using web-based similarity (e.g. confidence, PMI and PMING). We aim to extract basic emotions from short sentences with emotional content (e.g. news titles, tweets, captions), performing a web-based quantitative evaluation of semantic proximity between each word of the analyzed sentence and each emotion of a psychological model (e.g. Plutchik, Ekman, Lovheim). The phases of the extraction include: text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, filtering), search engine automated query, HTML parsing of results (i.e. scraping), estimation of semantic proximity, ranking of emotions according to proximity measures. The main idea is that, since it is possible to generalize semantic similarity under the assumption that similar concepts co-occur in documents indexed in search engines, therefore also emotions can be generalized in the same way, through tags or terms that express them in a particular language, ranking emotions. Training results are compared to human evaluation, then additional comparative tests on results are performed, both for the global ranking correlation (e.g. Kendall, Spearman, Pearson) both for the evaluation of the emotion linked to each single word. Different from sentiment analysis, our approach works at a deeper level of abstraction, aiming to recognize specific emotions and not only the positive/negative sentiment, in order to predict emotions as semantic data.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4616-0; POD:978-1-5090-4467-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881653","affective data;emotion extraction;emotion recognition;information retrieval;semantic similarity measures","Analytical models;Context;Emotion recognition;Frequency measurement;Psychology;Search engines;Semantics","emotion recognition;feature extraction;grammars;query processing;search engines;semantic Web;text analysis","HTML parsing;Web object;Web-based similarity;emotion extraction;emotion ranking;emotion recognition;search engine automated query;semantic proximity;text preprocessing","","","","","","","6-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Retrieval Profiling Framework for Thematic Interpretation of Al-Quran","A. A. Salahuddin; R. Othman","Dept. of Libr. & Inf. Sci., Int. Islamic Univ.

According to the theory of information retrieval (IR) that relevance judgment should be justified by user's needs, the aim of this research is to propose a retrieval profiling framework (RPF) for pooling relevant interpretations of al-Quran based on thematic search. A thematic interpretation of al-Quran is called tafseer al-maudu'iy (urdu language sentence). The domain tafseer al-maudu'iy is sensitive in IR due to its interrelation of Quranic interpretation within its verse(s). On account of this concern, this paper has proposed a RPF to develop a standard procedure for themes/topics of al-Quran in order to keep the interrelation in search. It has undertaken mix methodology with a comparative study on two thematic search engines of al-Quran and two sources of thematic interpretation of al-Quran to accomplish the procedure. With a counting number of themes and experts' justification, it encountered a pilot test to justify the validity of the RPF and found effective. Despite the limitation of data and experts, it is assumed that this RPF can contribute to users in thematic search of al-Quran as well as it can practically guide the IR system developers for generating a good retrieval platform based on thematic search of Quranic interpretation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4521-1; POD:978-1-5090-4522-8","10.1109/ICT4M.2016.036","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814889","Al-Quran;Information Retrieval;Profiling;Tafseer al-maudu'iy;Thematic interpretation","Google;Indexes;Information and communication technology;Metadata;Search engines;Semantics","humanities;information retrieval","Al-Quran;IR;Quranic interpretation;RPF;Urdu language sentence;information retrieval;relevance judgment;retrieval profiling framework;thematic interpretation;thematic search;thematic search engines","","","","","","","22-24 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To get a deeper understanding of how users organize music nowadays, we analyze user-created playlists crawled from the music streaming platform Spotify. Using this new data set we find an explanation of differences in the playlists using audio features and based on this compute playlist clusters. We find that 91% of all users create at least one playlist in the “feel good music”-cluster and classical music or rap music can be considered as niche music with respect to the number of playlists, however not as niche music when considering the number of users.

These methods were progressively modified to exploit the peculiarities of the Web including the use of the hyperlinked structure of the Web for relevance ranking. These Web IR techniques, however, are also being applied for searching and ranking to other forms of text collections which are not inherently web documents. Books (especially in PDF form) are by nature different from web pages because they lack an explicit hypertextual structure and therefore cannot be accurately and precisely searched and ranked using traditional approaches. Books contain a highly structured content with implicit logical connections among different parts of the same book as well as to related content in other books. These book structural semantics and logical connections could be discovered and used to establish a web of books where the logical concepts, images, figures, tables, and other parts are linked with each other thus resulting in a semantic graph, which could then be exploited by a semantic book search engine for more precise and accurate indexing, searching, ranking and recommendations. Based on this hypothesis, the paper outlines a high-level architecture for one of the possible implementations of a semantic book search engine, identifies all the potential areas of research for future researchers, and reports on our work in progress in the form of the proposed model for the purpose.

Finding useful information which matches user need from the bulk of web pages is a cumbersome task. In this paper, a novel and practical synonym retrieval technique is proposed for addressing this problem. For replacement of semantics, user intent is taken into consideration to realize the technique. To realize this technique, pattern generation is taken into consideration with the help of Parts-of-Speech tagging and Web Scrapping. Two approaches were built i.e. Non-Context Based Searching and Context-Based Searching while the latter technique proved to be a more efficient in dealing with intent-based linguistic semantics than the former one. The paper concludes with recommendations and future work by giving a new direction to natural language.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4470-2; POD:978-1-5090-4471-9","10.1109/WI.2016.0076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7817093","Information Retrieval;Natural Language Processing;POST;Parts-of-Speech Tagging;Text Mining;semantics;user intent","Buildings;Context;Internet;Semantics;Speech;Tagging","Internet;data mining;information retrieval;linguistics;natural language processing;text analysis","Web pages;Web scrapping;context-based searching;intent-based linguistic semantics;natural language;noncontext based searching;parts-of-speech tagging;pattern generation;synonym retrieval;synonym-based searching;text mining;unstructured data;user intent","","","","","","","13-16 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So, it's very much necessary to adopt a method that can be used organize the information well. This is possible only when good document groups are formed, which in turn can be achieved when effective and optimized cluster heads are identified. Our concern is to apply an algorithm for web document clustering. The algorithm proposed in this paper is, Cuckoo Search based on Levy Flight. Efficient cluster heads can be located using proposed Cuckoo Search algorithm. And Levy Flight helps us to speed up the local search which also ensures that it covers output domain efficiently. This algorithm is simple, efficient and it is easy to implement. A relative study of the proposed Cuckoo Search based on Levy Flight and K-means algorithm is carried out. The obtained result shows that good performance can be achieved when Cuckoo Search based on Levy Flight algorithm is used for clustering of web documents.","","","10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7732106","Clustering;Cuckoo Search;Information retrieval;K-means;Levy Flight","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Informatics;Optimization;Web search","Internet;document handling;information retrieval;optimisation;pattern clustering;search problems","Cuckoo Search algorithm;K-means algorithm;Levy Flight algorithm;Web document clustering;information retrieval;local search;optimized cluster heads","","","","","","","21-24 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This development requires the establishment of fast and sharp and specialized IRS, to answer a very specific need. In response, these systems carry out several steps, including the enrichment or reformulation of queries. The enrichment of queries consists to add terms to the initial query to find the right document. However, the problem of non relevance of results returned by the information retrieval systems is always present. A simple user seeking accurate information within a specific time is lost before a huge mass of information related to his field of research but who do not necessarily represent his need. Several research studies were launched to address this problem by providing both enrichment approaches, indexing, ... but without resolving it efficiently. This work falls within the same goal, it helps to enrich the user request using a domain ontology by adding terms (from ontology) to the user query to target the area research and return a relevant result. The presented approach will be integrated into the IRS of a meta search engine dedicated to a specific domain. The ontology used is composed of a set of concepts linked by semantic relationships, the idea is to extract from the set of ontology concepts (as hierarchy), which represent the field searched by the user. This approach is based initially on the interaction with the user to specify his needs and then, with our approach, on selecting appropriate ontology concepts.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0751-6; POD:978-1-5090-0752-3","10.1109/CIST.2016.7805056","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805056","Information retrieval;enrichment of queries;query reformulation;search engine","Computer science;Computers;Indexing;Ontologies;Search engines;Semantics","Internet;indexing;information retrieval systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;search engines","Internet;domain ontology;indexing;information retrieval systems;meta search engine;query enrichment;query reformulation;semantic relationships;specialized IRS;user query;user request","","","","","","","24-26 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has gained immense amount of importance in recent times due to the growing number of blogs, forums and other social networks which contain huge amount of opinions. Feature extraction is an important factor in opinion mining which refers to the method of extracting those properties on which the opinions are based on. There is a method for identifying features based on Intrinsic and Extrinsic Domain Relevance (IEDR) which exploits the difference in opinion feature's statistics across two corpora. The approach includes syntactic rules to process the review sentences and a well known and generalized weight equation with a numerical statistic known as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to calculate domain relevance which often fails to identify many of the legitimate features. So in this paper, we propose an effective approach of this IEDR technique for the purpose of feature extraction. Our proposed approach includes a handful of extended syntactic rules to process review sentences. It also includes optimization in calculation of domain relevance with the modification of weight equation. To verify our proposed approach, we have applied it on two real-world review corpora along with the existing IEDR approach. Our proposed approach exhibits a remarkable improvement in performance for finding opinion features outperforming the currently existing IEDR method.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1269-5; POD:978-1-5090-1270-1","10.1109/ICIEV.2016.7760040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760040","English;Feature Extraction;Information Retrieval;Natural Language Processing;Opinion Mining;Reviews","Cameras;Dispersion;Feature extraction;Frequency-domain analysis;Mathematical model;Natural language processing;Syntactics","feature extraction;information retrieval;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","IEDR technique;computational linguistics;extrinsic domain relevance technique;feature extraction;generalized weight equation;intrinsic domain relevance technique;natural language processing;opinion mining;real-world review corpora;sentiment analysis;social networks;subjective information extraction;subjective information identification;syntactic rules;term frequency-inverse document frequency;text analysis","","","","","","","13-14 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dealing with real audio recordings requires the ability to handle both uncertainty and complex relational structure at multiple levels of representation. Until now, these two aspects have been generally treated separately, probability being the standard way to represent uncertainty in knowledge, while logical representation being the standard way to represent knowledge and complex relational information. Several approaches attempting a unification of logic and probability have recently been proposed. In particular, Markov logic networks (MLNs), which combine first-order logic and probabilistic graphical models, have attracted increasing attention in recent years in many domains. This paper introduces MLNs as a highly flexible and expressive formalism for the analysis of music that encompasses most of the commonly used probabilistic and logic-based models. We first review and discuss existing approaches for music analysis.

These ranking algorithms are one of the success factors behind today's popular web search engines including Ask, Bing, Google, and Yahoo! etc., with Google on the top since long. Besides other ranking signals, Google uses PageRank algorithm in ranking the search results, which makes Google successful and superior to others. Since its inception in 1998, it has been at the heart of Google's ranking system and considered a serious breakthrough in ranking web pages on the Web. Researchers and scientists followed this linkbased strategy and came up with similar ranking algorithms including Weighted PageRank, which together with PageRank, have been the focus of research articles covering several aspects and properties. In this article, we report an empirical investigation of PageRank algorithm and Weighted PageRank algorithm with respect to the property of convergence. Results of the study show that both these algorithms are limited especially with respect to convergence. Based on these results, we propose a new flavor of PageRank called Ratio-based Weighted PageRank that performs better than PageRank and Weighted PageRank algorithms especially in terms of convergence.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5300-1; POD:978-1-5090-5301-8","10.1109/FIT.2016.071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7866780","Algorithms;Convergence;Information Retrieval;PageRank;Relevance Ranking","Computer science;Convergence;Damping;Google;Mathematical model;Web pages","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval","Ask;Bing;Google ranking system;IR;Web information retrieval;Web pages;Web search engines;World Wide Web;Yahoo!;page-ranking algorithms;ranking pages;ranking signals;ratio-based weighted PageRank;similar ranking algorithms;weighted PageRank algorithm","","","","","","","19-21 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, it is estimated that more than 30% of English vocabulary has been inherited from Latin, which has dominated medical terminology in particular. We use this fact by exploring word sense disambiguation (WSD) in multilingual environment. Specifically in the medical domain, language pair phenomena can be limited to synonymy of the cognate technical terms. Our approach is investigated based on Boolean and Free Text Search modes on the comparison basis. For measuring the efficiency of our methodology we use the classical Salton model of tf-idf term weighting schemes, however extended by Karen Spärck Jones. Our results are very promising since they indicate that similarity between the synonymous words being English medical terms and their target language equivalents enables significant limitation of the target word senses even those outside the language family like e.g. for the English and Polish language pair phenomena. Such a limitation of the number of target word senses results in better disambiguation and is more context-driven. Also, consequently it translates onto the higher precision in multilingual medical information retrieval.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2000-3; POD:978-1-5090-2001-0","10.1109/INTECH.2016.7845125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7845125","computational linguistics;information extraction;medical informatics;multilingual information retrieval;similarity metrics;word sense disambiguation","Context;Europe;Indexes;Terminology;Weight measurement","Boolean functions;computational linguistics;information retrieval;medical computing;natural language processing","Boolean modes;English language pair phenomena;English medical terms;Latin vocabulary;Polish language pair phenomena;Salton model;cognate technical term synonymy;free text search modes;medical term extraction;medical terminology;multilingual framework;multilingual medical information retrieval;tf-idf term weighting schemes;word sense disambiguation","","","","","","","24-26 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we apply the differential evolution optimization method to find suitable weights in the search space. Experiments are carried out with authoritative TREC data and we find it is a good method for the task and can improve fusion performance significantly than the best component results and other heuristic data fusion methods. Moreover, we have two findings. One finding is compared with other fusion methods, differential evolution based method performs better when more component search engines are involved in the fusion process.

Against this background, a retrieval scheme was proposed to estimate dry-snow density and ground permittivity from passive L-band measurements. In this study, the sensitivity of the recently proposed retrieval scheme with respect to surface roughness and snowpack density profile heterogeneities is investigated using synthetic brightness temperatures <formula><tex>$T_{rm B}^{p}$</tex></formula>. While the original retrieval algorithm proposed to use <formula><tex>$T_{rm B}^{p}(theta)$</tex></formula> at observation angles θ and both polarizations p = “H” and p = “V”, the present analysis involves three polarization retrieval modes: “HV”, “H”, and “V” to identify the most robust one. The analyses based on synthetic <formula><tex>$T_{rm B}^{p}(theta)$</tex></formula> suggest the use of exclusively vertical polarization (“V” retrieval mode) in case of low “instrumental noise” of <formula><tex>$sigma T_{rm B},{&lt; ,text{0.5},rm{K}}$</tex></formula>, as it yields most accurate results in the presence of heterogeneities in profiles and imperfect parametrization of ground surface roughness. The applied retrieval scheme still yields accurate results even in the presence of “instrumental noise” (<formula><tex>$sigma T_{rm B},ge ,text{0.5}$</tex></formula> K) in retrieval mode “HV”. Furthermore, it is shown that ground-permittivity retrievals are less affected than snow - ensity retrievals by ground roughness variations or heterogeneities in snow density profiles. Altogether, our sensitivity investigations indicate the robustness of the retrieval scheme applied thereto with respect to snow density profile heterogeneities, which is expedient for its use with spaceborne radiometry data from, for example, “Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity” or “Soil Moisture Active Passive” satellites.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2669336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7879265","Information retrieval;microwave radiometry;permittivity;sensitivity;snow;soil","Brightness temperature;L-band;Permittivity;Rough surfaces;Snow;Surface roughness;Temperature measurement","","","","","","","","20170315","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Finding similar repositories on GitHub can be helpful for software engineers as it can help them reuse source code, build prototypes, identify alternative implementations, explore related projects, find projects to contribute to, and discover code theft and plagiarism. Previous studies have proposed techniques to detect similar applications by analyzing API usage patterns and software tags. However, these prior studies either only make use of a limited source of information or use information not available for projects on GitHub. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can effectively detect similar repositories on GitHub. Our approach is designed based on three heuristics leveraging two data sources (i.e., GitHub stars and readme files) which are not considered in previous works. The three heuristics are: repositories whose readme files contain similar contents are likely to be similar with one another, repositories starred by users of similar interests are likely to be similar, and repositories starred together within a short period of time by the same user are likely to be similar. Based on these three heuristics, we compute three relevance scores (i.e., readme-based relevance, stargazer-based relevance, and time-based relevance) to assess the similarity between two repositories. By integrating the three relevance scores, we build a recommendation system called RepoPal to detect similar repositories. We compare RepoPal to a prior state-of-the-art approach CLAN using one thousand Java repositories on GitHub. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that RepoPal achieves a higher success rate, precision and confidence over CLAN.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5501-2; POD:978-1-5090-5502-9","10.1109/SANER.2017.7884605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7884605","GitHub;Information Retrieval;Recommendation System;Similar Repositories","Androids;Humanoid robots;Java;Open source software;Plagiarism;Search engines","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;public domain software;recommender systems","API usage pattern analysis;GitHub;RepoPal;content similarity;open source project;readme file similarity;recommendation system;relevance scores;similar repository detection;software engineers;source code reuse","","","","","","","20-24 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose that such a property could be leveraged in resource selection by adapting well-studied and popular inverted lists for centralized document retrieval. Accordingly, we propose the Inverted PeerCluster Index (IPI), an approach that adapts the inverted lists, in a straightforward manner, for resource selection in clustered P2P IR. IPI also encompasses a strikingly simple peer-specific scoring mechanism that exploits the said index for resource selection. Through an extensive empirical analysis on P2P IR testbeds, we establish that IPI competes well with the sophisticated state-of-the-art methods in virtually every parameter of interest for the resource selection task, in the context of clustered P2P IR.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4459-7; POD:978-1-5090-4460-3","10.1109/ICTAI.2016.0064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814624","Clustering Peers;Evaluation;Information Retrieval;Peer to Peer;Query Routing;Semi-structured","Clustering algorithms;Coherence;Computer architecture;Indexes;Information retrieval;Peer-to-peer computing;Query processing","information networks;pattern clustering;peer-to-peer computing;query processing;resource allocation","IPI;P2P IR architectures;P2P IR networks;centralized document retrieval;clustering-based query routing;cooperative semistructured peer to peer networks;document allocation;inverted PeerCluster index;peer-to-peer information retrieval networks;resource selection;resource selection layer","","","","","","","6-8 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many online profiles claim expertise, but possessing true expertise is rare. We characterize expertise as projected expertise (claims of a person), perceived expertise (how the crowd perceives the individual) and true expertise (factual). StockTwits, an investor-focused microblogging platform, allows us to study all three aspects simultaneously. We analyze more than 18 million tweets spanning 1700 days. The large time scale allows us to also analyze expertise and its categories as they evolve over time, which is the first study of its kind on StockTwits. We propose a method to capture perceived expertise by how significantly a user's follower network grows and how often the user is brought up in conversations. We also quantify actual, market-based, true expertise based on the user's trade and investment recommendations. Finally we provide an analysis bringing out the differences between how users project themselves, how the crowd perceives them, and how they are actually performing on the market. Our results show that users who project themselves as experts are ones that talk the most and provide the least recommendation-to-tweet ratio (that is, most of their conversations are mundane). The recommendations from users who project novice expertise slightly outperform (≈5%) the overall stock market. On the other hand, the trade recommendations from self-proclaimed experts yield 80% less than those of intermediate traders. Interestingly, users who are perceived as experts by others, as measured by centrality measurements, resulted in net negative returns after a four year trading period. Our study also looks at the evolution of expertise, and begins to understand why and what makes users change the way they project their own expertise.

The social networks that facilitate users to share the check-in (location visit) information are known as the location-based social networks (LBSN)s and provide various information for a recommendation problem that span beyond the user-location ratings, and comments. For instance, the time of the check-in, the category of the POI, the distance of POI from the user's home, the user's friends' visit to that place, and so forth. It's worthwhile to explore and efficiently integrate such information for the desired purpose. A Point of Interest (POI) recommendation system uses a user's historical check-in information from LBSNs and recommends the list of places that are potential for future visits. Many of the existing POI recommendation systems have focused on either of the temporal (time of the check-in), the geographical/spatial (distance between check-in locations), or the social (friendship, and trust based) aspects. Incorporation of all the major aspects (the categorical, the geographical, the social, and the temporal) of check-ins into a single model is barely explored by other studies. In this paper, we propose a fused model termed GeoTeCS (Geographical Temporal Categorical and Social) for personalized location recommendation. GeoTeCS uses the matrix factorization technique and an extension of the Multi-center Gaussian Model (MGM) to model the users' historical check-in behavior by fusing the major check-in aspects. The contributions of this paper are: (i) it proposes a matrix factorization based location recommender that incorporates all the major aspects-the categorical, the geographical, the social, and the temporal aspects into a single model and (ii) it extensively evaluates the proposed model against two real-world datasets - the Gowalla, and the Weeplaces, to illustr- te its effectiveness.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3207-5; POD:978-1-5090-3208-2","10.1109/IRI.2016.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785729","Information Retrieval;Matrix Factorization;Point of Interest Recommendation;Recommendation system","Computational modeling;Electronic mail;Fuses;Green's function methods;Market research;Multimedia communication","Gaussian processes;Internet;matrix decomposition;recommender systems;social aspects of automation;social networking (online)","GeoTeCS;Gowalla datasets;LBSN;MGM;WWW technology;Weeplace datasets;World Wide Web;geographical-temporal-categorical-social aspects;location-based social networks;matrix factorization based location recommender;multicenter Gaussian model;multimedia contents;personalized POI recommendation system;personalized location recommendation;point of interest;user historical check-in information","","","","","","","28-30 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the existing limitations make the present algorithms difficult to deal with large-scale datasets: (1) discrete constraints are involved in the learning of the hash function, (2) pairwise or triplet similarity is adopted to generate efficient hashcodes, resulting both time and space complexity are greater than O(n2). To address these issues, we propose a novel discrete supervised hash learning framework which can be scalable to large-scale datasets. First, the learning procedure is decomposed into a binary classifier learning scheme and hashcodes learning scheme. Second, we adopt the Asymmetric Low-rank Matrix Factorization and propose the Fast Clustering-based Batch Coordinate Descent method, such that the time and space complexity is reduced to O(n). The proposed framework also provides a flexible paradigm to incorporate with arbitrary hash function, including deep neural networks. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is superior or comparable with state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5473-2; POD:978-1-5090-5474-9","10.1109/ICDM.2016.0184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837997","Asymmetric Matrix Factorization;Discrete Method;Hash Learning;Information Retrieval","Binary codes;Matrix decomposition;Neural networks;Quantization (signal);Semantics;Training;Training data","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;neural nets;pattern classification","asymmetric matrix factorization;binary classifier learning scheme;deep neural networks;discrete constraints;fast clustering-based batch coordinate descent method;scalable discrete supervised hash learning framework;space complexity;time complexity","","","","","","","12-15 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, considering that each note can be played in different positions of the guitar fretboard, this is not a straightforward process, and can be classified as a combinatorial optimization problem. For this reason, we have employed a comparative study of different algorithms: A-star, genetic algorithms (GA), genetic algorithms based on subpopulations (GA-SP), ant colony optimization (ACO) and differential evolution (DE). It was also included heuristics based on local search 2-opt and 3-opt in the approaches GA, GA-SP and DE.

One of the concerns on encrypted searches is frequency attacks. In frequency attacks, adversaries guess the meaning of the encrypted words by observing a large number of encrypted words in search queries and mapping the encrypted words to guessed plain text words using their known histogram. Thus, it is important for defenders to know how many encrypted words adversaries need to observe before they correctly guess the encrypted words. However, doing so takes long time for defenders because of the large volume of the encrypted words involved. We developed and evaluated Moving Average Bootstrap (MAB) method for estimating the number of encrypted words (N*) an adversary needs to observe before an adversary correctly guesses a certain percentage of the observed words with a certain confidence. Our experiments indicate that MAB method lets defenders to estimate N* using only 5% of the time, compared to the cases without MAB. Because of the significant reduction in the required time for estimating N*, MAB will contribute to the safety in encrypted searches.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1445-3; POD:978-1-5090-1446-0","10.1109/CloudCom.2016.0066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7830707","Encrypted searches;bootstrap method;data storage presentations;inform;information filtering;information retrieval;information search and retrieval;known-plaintext attacks;object representation;oblivious searches;relevance feedback;search process","Ciphers;Cloud computing;Electronic mail;Fluctuations;Resilience;Search problems","cryptography;statistical analysis;text analysis","MAB method;confidential encrypted searches;encrypted words;frequency attacks;moving average bootstrap method;text words","","","","","","","12-15 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MER is helpful in music understanding, music retrieval, and other music-related applications. As volume of online musical contents expands rapidly in recent years, demands for retrieval by emotion have been emerging lately. Determining the emotional content of music computationally is an interdisciplinary research involving not only signal processing and machine learning, but the understanding of auditory perception, psychology, cognitive science, and musicology. One of the challenges in evaluating automatic music emotion detection is that there is currently no well-developed emotion model for music emotion description. Moreover, owing to the low transparency of the acoustic feature based music emotion recognizer, it is difficult to interpret data generated by this mechanism. In this study, a two-level classification system based on both music genre and music feature pre-described by the domain knowledge is proposed. This framework has the advantage of utilizing the most suitable acoustic information. Experiments will be conducted via the measure of the correlation between diverse emotional expressions and various musical cues. To verify the performance of overall system, the proposal model will also be evaluated based on the consistency between music features and ground-truth emotions.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7860930","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860930","Affective computing;Feature extraction;Music emotion recognition;Music information retrieval;Support vector machine","Cybernetics;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Rhythm;Support vector machines","acoustic signal processing;affective computing;emotion recognition;feature extraction;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);music;signal classification;support vector machines","MER;acoustic feature;emotional expression detection;machine learning;music emotion recognition;music emotion recognizer;music feature;music genre;music retrieval;music understanding;signal processing;two-level support vector classification","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Afterwards they use the cosine distance for ordering the documents that best match the search query. The same cosine distance is used in order to compute the distance between two documents represented in the vector space. This article proposes a new approach, in which both the documents and the search query are represented as a time series of words. As a consequence, the document is no longer seen as a `bag of words' but as a sequence of words in which the order is essential. On top of this model we will use a well known algorithm in time series, dynamic time warping (DTW), in order to compute the distance between a search query and a document or between two documents. In order to improve the model, we enhance the algorithm to take into consideration the semantic context by using WordNet when computing the distance between words. This semantic enablement integrates smoothly into the time series model that we propose and it permits us to go beyond the `bag of words' model into the semantic search area.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5398-8; POD:978-1-5090-5399-5","10.1109/RoEduNet.2016.7753247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7753247","cosine distance;information retrieval;semantic search;time series;vector space model","Computational modeling;Computer science;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Semantics;Standards;Time series analysis","document handling;query processing;time series;vectors","DTW;WordNet;bag of words model;cosine distance;document semantic distance;dynamic time warping;information retrieval systems;search query;semantic context;time series model;vector space model","","","","","","","7-9 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a set of features to classify genres of music. The features proposed were obtained by a methodical selection of important features used in the literature of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Music Emotion Recognition (MER). Besides, we propose a new music dataset called BMD (Brazilian Music Dataset)<sup>1</sup>, containing 120 songs labeled in 7 musical genres: FoFFó, Rock, Repente, MPB(Música Popular Brasileira - Brazilian Popular Music), Brega, Sertanejo and Disco. An important characteristic of this new dataset compared with others, is the presence of three popular genres in Brazil Northeast region: Repente, Brega and a characteristic genre similar to MPB, which we also call as MPB. We evaluated our proposed features on both datasets: GTZAN and BMD. The proposed approach achieved average accuracy (after 30 runs of 5-fold-cross-validations) of 79.7% for GTZAN and 86.11% for the BMD. Another important contribution of this work is random repetition of cross-validation executions. Most of the papers performs only a single n-fold cross-validation. We criticize that practice and propose, at least, 30 random executions to compute the average accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4165-7; POD:978-1-5090-4166-4","10.1109/ICDSP.2016.7868526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868526","Audio Signal Processing;Music Genre Recognition;Pattern Recognition, Information Retrieval","Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Music information retrieval;Rhythm;Rocks;Support vector machines","emotion recognition;information retrieval;music;pattern classification","BMD;Brazil Northeast region;Brazilian music dataset;Brazilian popular music;Brega;Disco;FoFFó;GTZAN;MER;MIR;MPB;Repente;Sertanejo;cross-validation executions;high genre classification accuracies;música popular Brasileira;music datasets evaluation;music emotion recognition;music features;music information retrieval;n-fold cross-validation;regional Brazilian music;robust music genre classification approach;rock","","","","","","","16-18 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many symptoms like high temperature, fever, or headache, are ambiguous in terms of suggesting wide variety of possible patient's conditions to the GP, while other symptoms are mutually dependant, which again can be misleading to make an accurate diagnosis. On the other hand, doctor's up-to-date knowledge on the medicaments, drugs, active medical substances included, anticipated range of diseases relating to the symptoms reported, and the most reliable pharmaceutical manufacturers, are of the greatest importance to cure the illness successfully. This study proposes an approach to support so called standard medical procedure or clinical guidelines in treatment of each of the diseases by delivering such a knowledge to the physician and by individualizing the selection of drugs in respect to the patient's specific needs in order to avoid a potential drug interaction. We evaluate efficiency of a medical multilingual decision support system Diagnosia on the grounds of accessibility to such a knowledge depending on the EU language and we use Bayesian inference for generating the optimal decision on reaching a particular diagnosis accuracy. Our methodology is examined on the real data taken from the American service Prescriber Checkup and some other knowledge-based medical resources of nationally recognized rank. Our findings indicate that this approach outperforms not only traditional standard procedure of curing some commonly occurring illnesses, but also many commercial computer-assisted medical support diagnostic systems.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3370-6; POD:978-1-5090-3371-3","10.1109/HealthCom.2016.7749434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7749434","Decision Support Systems;Information Retrieval;Medical Informatics;Pattern Recognition;eHealth","Conferences;Decision making;Diseases;Drugs;Medical diagnostic imaging","Internet;belief networks;decision support systems;health care;information retrieval","Bayesian inference;Web information retrieval;computer-assisted clinical diagnosis;ehealth services;health care professionals;medical multilingual decision support system;official European union languages","","","","","","","14-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To calculate the similarity of Web services using generated ontology, this paper defines new logic based filters.

While the feature data for a particular music excerpt is concrete, the emotions felt by a person are subjective. Although personal experiences can influence a person's perception of music, the combination of music features, such as timbre, tonality and rhythm all contribute to the perceived emotion. In addition, humans often associate multiple emotions with a particular piece of music making it difficult to measure the emotions evoked by music using only a small subset of emotions. This research defines a set of algorithms to map detailed feature data extracted from a group of instrumental music excerpts to a complex combination of emotion categories. In this way, feature data can be used to represent emotion as a blend of moods, simulating a more authentic flow of human emotion.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821602","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821602","Machine learning;Music information retrieval;Predictive models;Signal mapping","Bars;Data mining;Feature extraction;Linear regression;Mood;Music;Springs","feature extraction;information retrieval;music","emotion categories;feature data extraction;human emotion representation;instrumental music excerpts;music retrieval","","","","","","","6-7 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve the best retrieval result, an optimal feature must be invented to represent an image semantic. At present, instead of using single feature, most image retrieval system utilizes combining features between two low-level features in an image to retain high precision when faces to the mentioned problem. However, the retrieval error still remains. It causes from the combination of two unsuitable features. Thus, choosing two compatible features is another interested research issue in this area. This paper proposed a new feature combination between color correlograms and edge direction histogram (EDH) in order to give precedence to spatial information in an image. Using color correlogram will treat information about spatial color correlation, while EDH provides the geometry information in the case of the same image but different color. Performance evaluation performs by simple calculation like Euclidean Distance between the query image and image in the database.

Using the method, it is possible to resolve amplitudes of overlapping harmonics, which is otherwise an ill-posed problem. The method is based on the extended invariance principle (EXIP), and a codebook consisting of realistic amplitude vectors. A nonlinear least squares (NLS) cost function is formed based on the observed signal and a parametric model of the signal, for a set of fundamental frequency candidates.

The ontology modeling is primarily responsible to represent the knowledge area via domain ontology. Then, a number of semantic queries retrieve the necessary information inside the ontology. Further, the engine has the flexibility to dynamically incorporate the modifications in domain ontology. By exploiting the engine user can extract the novel related parameters without going into the details and inefficient way.

It enables music search by instrument, helps recognize musical genres, or can make music transcription easier and more accurate. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network framework for predominant instrument recognition in real-world polyphonic music. We train our network from fixed-length music excerpts with a single-labeled predominant instrument and estimate an arbitrary number of predominant instruments from an audio signal with a variable length. To obtain the audio-excerpt-wise result, we aggregate multiple outputs from sliding windows over the test audio. In doing so, we investigated two different aggregation methods: one takes the class-wise average followed by normalization, and the other perform temporally local class-wise max-pooling on the output probability prior to averaging and normalization steps to minimize the effect of averaging process suppresses the activation of sporadically appearing instruments. In addition, we conducted extensive experiments on several important factors that affect the performance, including analysis window size, identification threshold, and activation functions for neural networks to find the optimal set of parameters. Our analysis on the instrument-wise performance found that the onset type is a critical factor for recall and precision of each instrument. Using a dataset of 10k audio excerpts from 11 instruments for evaluation, we found that convolutional neural networks are more robust than conventional methods that exploit spectral features and source separation with support vector machines. Experimental results showed that the proposed convolutional network architecture obtained an F1 measure of 0.619 for micro and 0.513 for macro, respectively, achieving 23.1% and 18.8% in performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2016.2632307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755799","Convolutional neural networks;deep learning;instrument recognition;multi-layer neural network;music information retrieval","Convolution;Instruments;Machine learning;Music;Neural networks;Speech;Speech recognition","audio signal processing;music;neural nets;source separation;support vector machines","activation function;analysis window size;audio signal;deep convolutional neural network;fixed-length music excerpt;identification threshold;music information retrieval;predominant instrument recognition;real-world polyphonic music;sliding window;source separation;spectral feature exploitation;support vector machine;temporally local class-wise max-pooling;test audio","","","","","","20161123","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present a method which is based on novelty detection and combines multiple features to the task of music boundaries detection. We extract peaks of novelty function derived from various features as potential boundaries, then eliminate non-boundaries from potential boundaries derived from distinct feature sets.

Conventional person identification methods are using an ID card or the combination of a username and password. Recently, new techniques based on biometrics have been introduced so that people do not need to worry if they forget their username and password. For example, fingerprint and iris recognition are becoming common methods of person identification; however, users are usually required to interact with a system to use these traits. In some non-critical situations, it may be more convenient to utilize soft biometrics for person identification, although these features are not as unique for a specific person. In this work, we propose to conduct gait analysis that can be performed from a distance without disturbing user activities. We utilize depth cameras to capture user movements and create motion sequences. Then, a motion sequence is transformed to a motion string with appropriate data preprocessing and clustering techniques. Representative motion strings representing the individual behaviour of a user are retrieved and utilized to identify people. Empirical studies based on real motion data show that our approach performs well in person identification.","","CD:978-1-5090-3469-7; Electronic:978-1-5090-3471-0; POD:978-1-5090-3472-7; Paper:978-1-5090-3470-3","10.1109/ICKEA.2016.7803016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803016","gait analysis;information retrieval;person identification;soft biometrics","Biomedical imaging;Pins","iris recognition;motion estimation","ID card;conduct gait analysis;iris recognition;motion data retrieval;motion sequences;password;person identification;representative motion strings;soft biometrics;user activities;user movements;username","","","","","","","28-30 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to preserve the user privacy from a search engine, many privacy preserving solution have been proposed including query obfuscation, anonymizing networks and Peer to Peer Private Information Retrieval Protocols. However, first two solutions cannot preserve user privacy completely and they have their own drawbacks as well, while the Peer-to-Peer Private Information Retrieval protocols are passing through evolution stage. The focus of this paper is to evaluate and quantify the techniques use to preserve privacy by two major protocols of Private Information Retrieval protocols including Useless User Profile and User Private Information Retrieval. In this research association rule mining technique is used to expose the source of query of interest. Each protocol is simulated under varying parameters of Group Size, Number of Query of Interest and association rule mining Window Size over the released data of American Online. The results shows that on the average the proposed adversarial model exposed 85.34% and 80.75% Query of Interest source correctly of Useless User Profile and User Private Information Retrieval protocol respectively.

Developing a high-precision identification system for classifying avian species would support the conservation, especially for the field research. In this study, we design such a system for automatically classifying the avian calls based on a variety of feature extractions under different types of noise conditions. Furthermore, support vector machine, a classifier with optimal separating hyperplane, is used for identifying avian species.

Another limitation is that they are usually designed for programmers, not for the ordinary users. In this paper, we propose Chronological Big data Curation system. In the proposed system, acquisition and care of data are processed on the basis of relations between specific topics and chronological order to ensure that data maintains its value over time. The system is implemented and experimental results show the goodness of the proposed system.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2642979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792681","Big data;Chronological Order;Curation;Information Retrieval","Big data;Data mining;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Internet","","","","","","","","20161221","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"A personalized time-bound activity Recommendation System","R. Mittal; V.

These algorithms analyze reviews from a group of people to find correlations between users and/or items in order to suggest top items to a querying user. The main issues with collaborative filtering are scalability and sparsity. Data sparsity creates a problem in scenarios where, a new location or activity that has not been reviewed by enough users is less likely to turn up as a recommendation. Also, users with unique interests do not benefit from such a model since the recommendations are irrespective of how relevant they may be to the user. There is also no system known to the authors, which recommends activities taking into consideration the time available with the user. Hence, a content based approach to generate a time-bound, relevant, personalized feed of `activities' in the nearby area is proposed in this paper. If the user is a die-hard trekker, into indie bands, or dislikes pub hopping, the system will always take that into consideration. Similarly, if someone only wants to spend a couple of hours and is interested in outdoor activities, he/she would be recommended ice-skating instead of hiking.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4228-9; POD:978-1-5090-4229-6","10.1109/CCWC.2017.7868485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868485","Automatic Travel Guide;Clustering;Feature Extraction;Information Retrieval;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Personalization;Recommendation System;Sentiment Analysis;Time Estimation","Couplings;Facebook;Feature extraction;Filtering;Measurement;Mood","collaborative filtering;data handling;query processing;recommender systems;social networking (online)","Facebook;Foursquare;TripAdvisor;activity-listing services;collaborative filtering algorithm;community opinions/reviews;data sparsity;personalized time-bound activity recommendation system;user query","","","","","","","9-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The modern state of the problem leads to the point where machine learning becomes the most efficient way to optimize the ranking function. In this article investigated ranking function in information retrieval systems (IRS) and learning to rank problem. During the learning to rank process, IRS is defining the weight coefficients for simple rankers. The conducted researches are showing the approach for learning to rank problem LTR-MGA utilizing the hybrid method based on modified genetic algorithm and the Nelder-Mead method. This approach can be used to optimize a graded-metrics of ranking, such as NDCG. The efficiency of proposed method was proved, based on researches performed on LETOR data sets. The value of ranking quality measures was significantly increased after learning to rank process. Also the usage of modified genetic algorithms leads to reduction of time required for learning to rank comparing to traditional genetic algorithm.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4050-6; POD:978-1-5090-4051-3","10.1109/Dynamics.2016.7819080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7819080","Nelder-Mead method;genetic algorithm;information retrieval systems;learning to rank;ranking","Benchmark testing;Genetic algorithms;Information retrieval;Linear programming;Measurement;Optimization;Switches","document handling;genetic algorithms;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","IRS;LETOR data sets;LTR-MGA;Nelder-Mead method;information retrieval systems;machine learning;modified genetic algorithm;rank problem;ranking function optimization;ranking quality measurement;search index","","","","","","","15-17 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the web page is combination of noisy data like navigational link, advertisements, menus, footer, etc and informative data, so the complexity may increases for main content extraction from web pages. To access main content hand crafted rule technique were used which contain string manipulation functions but preparing these rules becomes much difficult task for the users. So we present a hybrid approach for extracting main content from the web pages. This approach is based on combination of automatic extraction and hand crafted rules techniques. The propose work is mainly focus on automatic extraction technique in which automatic rules are created instead of manual hand crafted rule creation. In this the web page is converted into DOM tree and features are extracted. Use this features in the machine leaning method like decision tree classification and dynamic rules are created. By using these rules informative content is extracted from the web pages. Further the rules which are created in the automatic extraction technique used as hand crafted rule for content extraction from the web pages without using machine learning method. Here the informative content like relevant text, images, multimedia are extracted from the web pages and these web pages are taken from the Internet i.e. Online. And also consider dataset for extracting relevant content. The propose work generates effective rules, achieve automaticity and efficiency.","","CD:978-1-4673-9936-4; DVD:978-1-4673-9937-1; Electronic:978-1-4673-9939-5; POD:978-1-4673-9940-1; USB:978-1-4673-9938-8","10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7754831","DOM tree;Information retrieval;content extraction;machine learning;rule techniques;web mining","Data mining;Entropy;Feature extraction;HTML;Image segmentation;Noise measurement;Web pages","Internet;Web sites;data mining;decision trees;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia computing;pattern classification;text analysis","DOM tree;Internet;advertisement;automatic rule creation;decision tree classification;dynamic rule creation;feature extraction;hand crafted rule technique;informative content extraction;informative data;machine leaning method;multimedia extraction;navigational link;noisy data;online Web pages by using hybrid approach;relevant images;relevant text;string manipulation function","","","","","","","3-5 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Students are given increasingly frequent access to the internet through various platforms such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and other mobile devices. Some schools are distributing mobile devices to students in order to facilitate the integration of technology in the classroom. These devices have a web filter installed on them to filter inappropriate content irrespective to the Wi-Fi network to which they are connected. These web filters collect logs of student activities on the internet. To date, however, this data has not been systematically analyzed. In this paper we explore data collected from K-12 student generated search queries on different search engines to gain insight into student learning behavior. Term frequency analysis is used to discover the relationship between effective and inappropriate usage of mobile devices in school.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1496-5; POD:978-1-5090-1497-2","10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7777882","Data Analytics;Data Mining;Information Retrieval;K-12 Education;Mobile Learning;Natural Language Processing;Term Frequency","Computers;Internet;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Text analysis","Internet;computer aided instruction;data handling;educational institutions;information filters;mobile computing;query processing","Internet;K-12 learning space;K-12 student learning behavior;United States;Web filter data;Wi-Fi network;mobile devices;schools;search queries;student activity log collection;student learning behavior;text analysis","","","","","","","20-22 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Documents ranking using new learning approach","S. Patel; K. Khanna; V.

In the literature, it has been shown that document similarity method first compute similarity scores between the query and the documents based on a score function. Thereafter, documents are ranked according to their similarity scores. In the literature, TextTiling algorithm shown was basically done in three stages: tokenization into sentence-sized units, score calculation and detecting the boundaries of the subtopic. In this paper, we have evaluated two different approaches for documents ranking and further we checked this achieved results with other approach based on machine learning Firstly, Documents are ranked based on standard score calculation i.e using the tf-idf concept. Secondly, Documents are ranked based on Textiling approach. TextTiles have already been integrated into a user interface in an information retrieval system and have been used successfully for segmenting Arabic newspaper texts, which have no paragraph breaks, for information retrieval. Textiling is a far better technique than the standard score calculation when we try to summarize the documents. This helps in the improving the retrieval performance of the system. In this paper, we have shown the comparative analysis of two approaches. Further, we also tried to incorporate the statistically machine learning approach in our results, for handling a broad range of problems in information retrieval (IR).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1666-2; POD:978-1-5090-1667-9","10.1109/CCAA.2016.7813691","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7813691","Information retrieval (IR);cosine similarity;document frequency (df);documents ranking;inverse document frequency(idf);maximum entropy principle (MEP);query expansion;term frequency (tf)","Automation;Computational modeling;Entropy;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;Probability distribution;Uncertainty","information retrieval systems;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing;text analysis;user interfaces","Arabic newspaper text segmentation;TextTiling algorithm;boundary detection;document ranking;document similarity method;documents ranking;information retrieval system;learning approach;query document;ranked documents;score calculation;score function;similarity scores;statistically machine learning;textiling approach;tokenization;user interface","","","","","","","29-30 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of asking restaurant nearest from the current location these new forms of queries will ask the restaurant nearest from current location with having some attached keywords like famous for brandy, or other menus as keywords attached with corresponding location. Existing solution are IR2 tree and Inverted Index; those have some deficiencies like verification bottleneck. To avoid this bottleneck proposed system is designed i.e “Spatial Inverted Index”. This is an extension of the Inverted Index approach.

"Soil Classification From Large Imagery Databases Using a Neuro-Fuzzy Classifier","S. Ghosh; D. Biswas; S. Biswas; D. Chanda Sarkar; P. P. Sarkar","Academy of Technology, Kolkata, India","Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","20161213","2016","39","4","333","343","In this paper, we propose a neuro-fuzzy (NF) classification technique to determine various soil classes from large imagery soil databases. The technique looks at the feature-wise degree of belongings of the imagery databases to obtainable soil classes using a fuzzification method. The fuzzification method builds a membership matrix with an element count equal to the mathematical product of the number of data records and soil classes present. The elements of this matrix are the input to a neural network model. We apply our technique to three UCI databases, namely, Statlog Landsat Satellite, Forest Covertype, and Wilt for soil classification. The paper aims to find out soil classes using the proposed technique, and then compare its performance with four well-known classification algorithms, namely, radial basis function network, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and adaptive NF inference system. Numerous measures, for example, root-mean-square error, kappa statistic, accuracy, false positive rate, true positive rate, precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the curve, are used for evaluating the quantitative analysis of the simulated results. All these evaluation measures approve the supremacy of the proposed NF method.","0840-8688;08408688","","10.1109/CJECE.2016.2596767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782452","Fuzzy neural networks;geographic information systems;image classification;image databases;information retrieval","Data mining;Databases;Noise measurement;Remote sensing;Satellites;Soil;Support vector machines","fuzzy neural nets;radial basis function networks;soil;support vector machines","Forest Covertype;Statlog Landsat Satellite;UCI database;adaptive NF inference system;fuzzification method;k-nearest neighbor;kappa statistic;large imagery databases;large imagery soil database;mathematical product;neural network model;neuro-fuzzy classifier;radial basis function network;root-mean-square error;soil classification;support vector machine","","","","","","","Fall 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the significant importance of process models, organizations are maintaining more and more process models to explicitly represent the flow of their business operations. The sheer number has led to the development of repositories to efficiently manage these collections. These repositories provide techniques for storing process models and searching relevant models against a given query process model. Searching involves comparing the query model with each source process model in the collection to compute the degree of similarity between query-source process model pair. While several techniques have been developed for that purpose, a direct comparison of these approaches have rarely been made. A key reason to that is, the absence of a freely available benchmark collection of process models that contains examples of process models with diverse features. To overcome that problem, we have employed a systematic and rigorous protocol to generate a diversified collection of process models, and compare it with the famous SAP's process model collection to establish the superiority of our collection. Further, we have applied a baseline approach to establish that the variants of process models (that we have generated) are significantly different from each other. It is pertinent to mention that our collection is freely available and we contend that the proposed collection will be useful in making a direct comparison of existing techniques and developing, evaluating and analyzing new techniques for process matching.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2000-3; POD:978-1-5090-2001-0","10.1109/INTECH.2016.7845083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7845083","Benchmark Process Model Collection;Information Retrieval;Information Systems;Process Model Repositories;Process Modeling","Benchmark testing;Business;Computational modeling;Guidelines;Process modeling;Protocols;Systematics","business data processing;information retrieval systems;information systems;query processing","BPMS;SAP process model;business operations;business process management systems;diverse label;enterprise information systems;query process model;query-source process model pair;structural features","","","","","","","24-26 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
