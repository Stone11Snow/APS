Image data is one of the multimedia types to be seen or accessed for the users in the Internet or from the database. Searching the related images by the querying image content is helpful to the management of image database. Most of the images are joint photographic experts group (JPEG) file format. Full decompression of JPEG file to spatial domain to extract the features for indexing takes time. Therefore, the research of JPEG file format indexing technique is worthwhile because it does not need the extra time to fulfill inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT). Essentially, the proposed method is a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system that can retrieval the images from the image database. In order to increase the efficiency of processing time, the proposed method fulfills partial decoding to JPEG file directly instead of full decoding and the feature vector extracted from the partial decoding can ensure the precise indexing as well. The system can output ranked images according to the similarity values in short time. In addition, the system has the property of robustness to rotation, scaling, translation, darkening, lightening, cropping, noise corruption, etc. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method outperforms the other existing DCT-based image indexing skills both from the aspects of robustness and processing burden","","POD:0-7695-2316-1","10.1109/ICITA.2005.156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1488994","","Content based retrieval;Decoding;Discrete cosine transforms;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Noise robustness","content-based retrieval;database indexing;discrete cosine transforms;feature extraction;image retrieval;visual databases","DCT;JPEG file;content-based image retrieval;discrete cosine transform;feature extraction;image database;image indexing;partial decoding","","2","","12","","","4-7 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, several popular image partition methods are investigated for adaptive image categorization based on structural representation.

Similarities among target images are usually ignored. This paper introduces a new technique, cluster-based retrieval of images by unsupervised learning (CLUE), for improving user interaction with image retrieval systems by fully exploiting the similarity information. CLUE retrieves image clusters by applying a graph-theoretic clustering algorithm to a collection of images in the vicinity of the query. Clustering in CLUE is dynamic. In particular, clusters formed depend on which images are retrieved in response to the query. CLUE can be combined with any real-valued symmetric similarity measure (metric or nonmetric). Thus, it may be embedded in many current CBIR systems, including relevance feedback systems. The performance of an experimental image retrieval system using CLUE is evaluated on a database of around 60,000 images from COREL. Empirical results demonstrate improved performance compared with a CBIR system using the same image similarity measure. In addition, results on images returned by Google's Image Search reveal the potential of applying CLUE to real-world image data and integrating CLUE as a part of the interface for keyword-based image retrieval systems.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2005.849770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468202","Content-based image retrieval (CBIR);image classification;similarity measure;spectral graph clustering;unsupervised learning","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image color analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;National electric code;Spatial databases;Unsupervised learning","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;relevance feedback;unsupervised learning;visual databases","CLUE;cluster-based retrieval of images by unsupervised learning;content-based image retrieval system;database;graph-theoretic clustering algorithm;keyword-based image retrieval systems;real-valued symmetric similarity measure;relevance feedback systems","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Databases, Factual;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated","114","3","42","","","Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The principle of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system is to retrieve images based on the content of the images. One of the important components in CBIR system is to extract the visual features of the images for performing more abstract analysis. However, some of these features are computationally expensive. To solve this issue, a flexible parallel architecture has been proposed to improve the extraction time for the system. This architecture provides the software system with the flexibility of adding and removing any visual features from the system. Thus, a system becomes more intelligent and so it is able to adapt changes caused by the replacement of more appropriate visual features for representing the images.","","POD:0-7803-8643-4","10.1109/ICCIS.2004.1460460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1460460","","Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Humans;Image analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexes;Information retrieval;Parallel architectures;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;parallel architectures;visual databases","content-based image retrieval system;feature extraction;image database;parallel architecture","","1","","9","","","1-3 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of music identification is to reliably recognize a song from a small sample of noisy audio. This problem is challenging because the recording is often corrupted by noise and because the audio sample will only match a small portion of the target song. Additionally, a practical music identification system should scale (in both accuracy and speed) to databases containing hundreds of thousands of songs. Recently, the music identification problem has attracted considerable attention. However, the task remains unsolved, particularly for noisy real-world queries. We cast music identification into an equivalent sub-image retrieval framework: identify the portion of a spectrogram image from the database that best matches a given query snippet. Our approach treats the spectrogram of each music clip as a 2D image and transforms music identification into a corrupted sub-image retrieval problem.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:0-7695-2372-2","10.1109/CVPR.2005.106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467583","","Acoustic noise;Audio recording;Computer vision;Image retrieval;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Spectrogram;Speech analysis","audio databases;audio signal processing;computer vision;image denoising;image retrieval;information retrieval systems;music;video signal processing","2D image;computer vision;music clip spectrogram;music identification system;noisy audio sample;noisy real-world queries;song databases;spectrogram image identification;subimage retrieval problem;video demonstration","","2","1","6","","","20-25 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the parametric model, attribute values are functions of time and the entire history of an object is modeled in terms of a single tuple. This property makes it difficult to adapt the parametric model within the conventional databases. However, XML is an attractive option for implementation because data boundaries are not problematic in XML. Native XML storage with pagination is used for storing temporal data and the DOM parser for the paginated XML storage is used for data access. The primitives for the query language are implemented using the DOM parser. Many artifacts, such as parse tree and expression tree are also represented in XML. We hope that this paradigm offers an elegant approach for implementation of complex data models.","1530-1311;15301311","POD:0-7695-2370-6","10.1109/TIME.2005.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443366","","Computer science;Data models;Database languages;Database systems;Hardware;History;Information retrieval;Parametric statistics;XML","XML;temporal databases","DOM parser;XML-based framework;data access;data boundary;expression tree;paginated XML storage;parametric data model;parse tree;query language;single tuple;temporal database","","0","","5","","","23-25 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, LSE maps for SEVIRI channels IR3.9, IR8.7, IR10.8, and IR12.0 were developed based on the vegetation cover method. A broadband LSE map (3-14 μm) was also developed for estimating longwave surface fluxes that may prove to be useful in both energy balance and climate modeling studies. LSE is estimated from conventional static land-cover classifications, LSE spectral data for each land cover, and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) information. Both International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) Data and Information System (DIS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) MOD12Q1 land-cover products were used to build the LSE maps. Data on LSE were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University and Jet Propulsion Laboratory spectral libraries included in the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer spectral library, as well as from the MODIS University of California-Santa Barbara spectral library. FVC data for each pixel were derived based on the normalized differential vegetation index. Depending on land cover, the LSE errors for channels IR3.9 and IR8.7 spatially vary from ±0.6% to ±24% and ±0.1% to ±33%, respectively, whereas the broadband spectrum errors lie between ±0.3% and ±7%. In the case of channels IR10.8 and IR12.0, 73% of the land surfaces within the MSG disk present relative errors less than ±1.5%, and almost all (26%) of the remaining areas have relative errors of ±2.0%. Developed LSE maps provide a first estimate of the ranges of LSE in SEVIRI channels for each surface type, and obtained results may be used to assess the sensitivity of algorithms where an a priori knowledge of LSE is required.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.851172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1487641","Emissivity;METEOSAT Second Generation-1 (MSG);Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI);land-surface temperature (LST);remote sensing;thermal infrared;vegetation cover method","Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Infrared imaging;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Least squares approximation;Libraries;MODIS;Spinning;Vegetation mapping","emissivity;infrared imaging;land surface temperature;vegetation mapping","IGBP Data and Information System;IR10.8;IR12.0;IR3.9;IR8.7;International Geosphere-Biosphere Program;Jet Propulsion Laboratory spectral library;Johns Hopkins University;METEOSAT Second Generation-1;MSG/SEVIRI;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer;Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager;University of California-Santa Barbara spectral library;climate modeling;energy balance;fractional vegetation cover;land-cover classifications;land-surface emissivity;land-surface temperature;remote sensing;thermal infrared;vegetation cover method","","53","","45","","","Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A PIR scheme allows a user to retrieve a date item from online database while hiding the index of the data item from the database server. However, retrieving valuable information is another problem needs to be solved. Most transactions are completed by credit card through delivering its number and membership in the Internet to the server. Then the server knows the privacy of users. It becomes a challenge to private information retrieval (PIR) schemes considering the e-payment need. In this paper, we propose a new PIR scheme, which use a secure coprocessor (SC), with e-payment scheme for protecting the privacy of customers in querying valuable information. The scheme does not reveal personal information or buying information of customers in the Internet environment, it can really protect the customers' privacy.

SW not only emerges from the knowledge representation and the Web communities, but also brings the two communities closer together. The software engineering community can also play an important role in the semantic Web development.

Recently, a tradeoff function of these two gains has been derived for a point-to-point MIMO system when optimal detection is used. In this paper, we extend the previous work to a more general MIMO system, where the transmitted data is coded in groups. Group detection is applied at the receiver to retrieve the data. It consists of a zero-forcing decorrelation that separates the groups, followed by a joint detection for each of the groups. Two receiver structures are considered in this paper; namely, group zero forcing (GZF) and group successive interference cancellation (GSIC). We assess the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff function of each of these receivers over a richly scattered Rayleigh fading channel. Three rate-allocation algorithms will be considered here; namely, equal rate, group-size proportional rate, and optimal-rate allocation. An explicit expression of the system tradeoff will be derived for both receivers with these three rate allocations. The obtained results will first be optimized over all possible group partitions for a given number of groups. Next, the number of groups will be varied to further optimize the system-tradeoff performance. An overall optimum tradeoff for a general MIMO system with group detection will then be obtained. Numerical results will indicate that optimum performance can be approached with very-low-complexity schemes for a wide range of data rates. It will be also demonstrated that group detection bridges the gap between the traditional decorrelator and the optimal receiver tradeoff performances.","0090-6778;00906778","","10.1109/TCOMM.2005.851596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468440","Channel capacity;channel multivariate statistics distribution;diversity-multiplexing tradeoff;group detection;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems;rate allocation","Associate members;Decorrelation;Diversity methods;Fading;Information retrieval;Information technology;Interference cancellation;MIMO;Partitioning algorithms;Rayleigh scattering","MIMO systems;Rayleigh channels;computational complexity;decorrelation;diversity reception;interference suppression;maximum likelihood detection;multiplexing;radio receivers;radiofrequency interference","MIMO systems;Rayleigh fading channel;diversity gains;diversity-multiplexing tradeoff;equal rate;group detection;group successive interference cancellation;group zero forcing decorrelation;group-size proportional rate;maximum likelihood detection;multiple-input multiple-output systems;optimal-rate allocation;point-to-point MIMO system;rate-allocation algorithms;receiver structures;spatial multiplexing gains;system-tradeoff performance","","27","4","17","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In heterogeneous canopies, simulations with the canopy reflectance model five-scale show that nadir view vegetation indices, such as NDVI and simple ratio (SR), based on near infrared and red reflectance are more closely related to the gap fraction at the solar zenith angle than the LAI. The gap fraction is important in canopy light interception. At the solar zenith angle, it can be used to estimate the amount of sunlit LAI. But the knowledge or LAI and foliage heterogeneity are both needed to estimate shaded leaves that are also important in the carbon cycle. In our previous studies, we developed a methodology to retrieve the foliage heterogeneity, represented by a clumping index, from remote sensing. The retrieval is accomplished with an anisotropy index using broadband directional reflectance at the hotspot and at the darkspot. The combination of nadir, hotspot, and darkspot views allows the LAI retrieval for a given cover type. However, directional measurements are not usually acquired with the same sun-target-sensor geometry, so the anisotropy kernel-based four-scale linear model for anisotropy reflectance (FLAIR) is used to interpolate the directional reflectance from ADEOS-POLDER data to acquire hotspot and darkspot reflectance at a common geometry in the near infrared band. A landcover map at 1-km based on SPOT-VGT data acquired in 1998 and directional POLDER data acquired over Canada in June 1997, are used to map the clumping index. The results show consistent clumping index values compared to in-situ values, and that SR and the anisotropy index are not correlated to each other, indicating that both indices are related to different canopy properties.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026869","","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Geography;Geometry;Information retrieval;Reflectivity;Remote sensing;Solar radiation;Solid modeling;Strontium;Vegetation mapping","vegetation mapping","ADEOS-POLDER data;Canada;FLAIR;LAI;NDVI;POLDER data;SPOT-VGT data;anisotropy canopy reflectance models;anisotropy index;broadband directional reflectance;canopy light interception;canopy reflectance model;clumping index;darkspot;directional reflectance models;five-scale;foliage heterogeneity;four-scale linear model for anisotropy reflectance;gap fraction;hotspot;leaf area index heterogeneity;nadir view vegetation indices;near infrared;red reflectance;remote sensing;shaded leaves;simple ratio;solar zenith angle","","0","","8","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Those tokens capture the representative information for describing the semantic meaning of that concept; (2) a set of posteriors are generated based on the low-level tokens through pairwise classification, which denote the probabilities of images belonging to the semantic concepts. The posteriors are treated as high-level features that connect images with high-level semantic concepts. Long-term relevance feedback learning is incorporated to provide the supervisory information needed in the above offline learning process, including the concept information and the relevant training set for each concept; (3) an integrated algorithm is implemented to combine two kinds of information for retrieval: the information from the offline feature-to-concept mapping process and the high-level semantic information from the long-term learned memory.

These algorithms were specially designed for the C-band SARs aboard the European satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2 operating at vertical (VV) polarization in transmit and receive and the Canadian satellite RADARSAT-1 operating at horizontal (HH) polarization. This paper shows the application of the algorithms to data of the advanced SAR (ASAR) from the European satellite ENVISAT. The wind retrieval algorithm consist of two parts. In the first wind directions are extracted from wind-induced streaks visible in most SAR images at scales between 200 and 1600 m using two different methods. In the second part wind speeds are derived from the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) and image geometry of the calibrated SAR images, together with the local wind direction resulting from the first step. For the wind speed retrieval the semi empirical. C-band scatterometer model CMOD5 is used. CMOD5 was originally developed for the scatterometer aboard ERS-1 and 2 operating at VV polarization and consequently requires modification if applied to HH-polarized SAR data. In case of HH-polarization the CMOD5 model is extended by considering the polarization ratio. It is shown that the quality of ENVISAT ASAR data is very well suited for measuring high-resolution ocean wind fields, which are especially important in coastal zones.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1294696","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294696","","Information retrieval;Oceans;Polarization;Radar measurements;Satellites;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Spaceborne radar;Synthetic aperture radar;Wind speed","oceanographic techniques;oceanography;radar imaging;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;wind","C-band SAR images;Canadian satellite;ENVISAT ASAR data;European satellites;coastal zones;horizontal polarization;normalized radar cross section;ocean wind field retrieval;resolution ocean surface;scatterometer model CMOD;space borne synthetic aperture radar;vertical polarization","","0","","8","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By employing pairwise boosting on a large set of Viola-Jones features, our system learns compact, discriminative, local descriptors that are amenable to efficient indexing. During the query phase, we retrieve the set of song snippets that locally match the noisy sample and employ geometric verification in conjunction with an EM-based ""occlusion"" model to identify the song that is most consistent with the observed signal.

Signal outputs from each PMT of the scintillation camera are digitized continually at 100 MHz into a ring buffer. When a Compton coincidence occurs, a snapshot of the digitized data is retrieved by a host computer for processing where correlations among the neighborhood PMT outputs are used to recover scintillation events from pileups and where position and energy information are subsequently computed. A new digital event detection algorithm is applied by using moving average filters and differentiator.

From a large data set of documents, we need to find documents that relate to human interesting in as few iterations of human testing or checking as possible. In each iteration a comparatively small batch of documents is evaluated for relating to the human interesting. We applied active learning techniques based on support vector machine for evaluating successive batches, which is called relevance feedback. Our proposed approach has been very useful for document retrieval with relevance feedback experimentally. The relevance feedback needs a set of relevant and nonrelevant documents to work usefully. However, the initial retrieved documents, which are displayed to a user, sometimes don't include relevant documents.

Traditionally, supervised learning is used to build models for detecting semantic concepts. However, in order to obtain a substantial amount of training data, extensive labeling work is needed with the supervised learning schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel autonomous learning framework in which imperfect labelling automatically extracted from cross-modality information is used for training. This completely avoids the manual labeling process. In our proposed framework, imperfect labels without user involvement are first obtained from cross-modality information. Then, based on our proposed new schemes, ""generalized multiple-instance learning"" and ""uncertain labeling density"", the system conjectures relevance scores of visual concepts. From these scores, support vector regression is used to build generic visual models. In preliminary experiments, we use the proposed system to learn 20 visual concepts in 6 hours of video. Compare with two concept models that were trained by two supervised algorithms, this novel autonomous learning framework achieves better system average precisions. Other concept models also show promising results.","0271-4302;02714302","POD:0-7803-8834-8","10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1465656","","Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Labeling;Learning systems;Sun;Supervised learning;Training data;Video sequences","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia databases;regression analysis;support vector machines;video databases","autonomous learning;cross-modality information;generalized multiple-instance learning;generic visual models;imperfect labelling;semantics;support vector regression;training;uncertain labeling density;video data retrieval;visual concept models","","1","","13","","","23-26 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, the global optimal solution is developed in both closed form and iterative form, providing that the latter converges to the former. The proposed method is unified in the senses that 1) it makes use of the information from various aspects in a global optimization manner so that the retrieval performance might be maximally improved; 2) it provides a natural way to support two typical query scenarios in image retrieval.

Generalized nearest-neighbour (GNN) matching improved NN matching in certain situations, but it is not generally applicable and it can cause an unexpected ranking. In order to improve the limitation of NN matching and complement the deficiency of GNN matching, we propose a novel nonlinear nearest-neighbour (NNN) matching function based on the adjustments for nonlinear effects and the fuzzy logic inference.

The search method was based on reconstructing only parts of the projection angles using an RBI-ML partial-reconstruction approach (PRA). It tests a motion description with only one forward projection per detector head instead of a full reconstruction using all projections. A figure of merit based on the per angle likelihood function in projection space was introduced. With simulated MCAT data we could show that the PRA was able to identify the optimum 3D rigid body motion correction with an error of 1 pixel in each cartesian direction.

These issues relate to the verbosity and the indivisible nature of the XML language. As such, bandwidth is wasted twofold as: (1) an RSS feed has no compact representation due to the plain text XML representation; and (2) previously received information about the RSS feed is discarded every time the RSS viewer retrieves the feed. Compression (binary encoding) of the XML data becomes relevant to eliminate the overhead. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of the MPEG-7 binary format for metadata to address both overhead issues. We validate its usability in a typical RSS scenario by calculating the byte size reduction and by comparing the processing speed of creating and parsing binary encoded RSS feeds to traditional RSS feeds.","","POD:0-7695-2316-1","10.1109/ICITA.2005.129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1488858","","Bandwidth;Blogs;Encoding;Feeds;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Subscriptions;Usability;Writing;XML","Web sites;XML;binary codes;data compression;encoding","MPEG-7 binary format for metadata;RSS feed;Web site;XML representation;binary encoding;data compression","","0","10","9","","","4-7 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new adaptive video indexing (AVI) technique based on a template-frequency model, together with a self-training retrieval architecture, is proposed, to allow full use of temporal information. AVI takes into account spatio-temporal information for relevance feedback analysis of the dynamic content of video data. The AVI indexing method can be effectively adapted for video shot, scene, and story queries, in order to facilitate multiple-level access to a video database. Our system incorporates this indexing structure to a self-training neural network which implements automatic adaptive retrieval, through its signal propagation process. This greatly reduces the search time for video transmissions over the Web because relevance feedback is implemented in automatic and semi-automatic fashions. The AVI structure not only works well in fully automatic mode, but is also effective in the user-interaction interface system, to achieve a user-friendly environment. Experimentally, we demonstrated the proposed indexing technique and automatic relevance feedback for retrieval of CNN news videos. We also investigated the resilience of the system with a user-controlled interaction process and applied this to an automatically indexed database of 20 h of Hollywood movies.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2005.852412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1490557","Automatic relevance feedback;content-based video indexing and retrieval (CBVR);interactive retrieval;self-organizing neural network","Content based retrieval;Databases;Feedback;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;Neural networks;Neurofeedback;Signal processing","content-based retrieval;database indexing;neural nets;relevance feedback;user interfaces;video databases;video signal processing","adaptive video indexing;content-based retrieval;multiple-level access;self-training neural network;self-training retrieval architecture;semiautomatic relevance feedback;signal propagation process;spatio-temporal information;template-frequency model;user-controlled interaction process;user-interaction interface system;video data dynamic content;video database applications;video transmissions","","7","","35","","","Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The European Space Agency's SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission, to be launched in 2007, aims at the generation of global SSS maps with a spatial and temporal resolution adequate for climatic and ocean general circulation studies. The sensor aboard SMOS is an L-band interferometric radiometer with full polarimetric capability called MIRAS (Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis). At low frequencies the brightness temperature measured by a radiometer presents maximum sensitivity to surface salinity, and optimal conditions are found at L-band (1400 MHz-1427 MHz), which it is a band protected for passive measurements. Even though the sensitivity is maximum at this frequency, it is not very high: 0.5 K/psu for sea temperature of 20°C, decreasing to 0.25 K/psu for 0°C. Furthermore, other variables influence the brightness temperature, as the sea roughness (mainly caused by the wind speed), sea foam, and also sea surface temperature. When SMOS will be in orbit it will be necessary to have accurate measurements of the sea roughness and surface temperature as much coincident as possible -both in time and space- to SMOS acquisitions, because errors on these ancillary data produce large errors on the retrieved salinity. This paper presents a study of the effect on the retrieved salinity of inaccuracies in the wind speed and wave height values. It compares the retrieved salinities when using different sources of these ancillary data: satellite measurements and meteorological models.

One of the best solutions to this problem is to execute a multipattern search of a set of pieces of the pattern, followed by a local decompression and a direct verification in the decompressed areas. In this work an improvement to this solution concerning verification is presented, where instead of executing a decompression process and searching for the pattern, bit-parallel automata are constructed that recognize the pattern.

Like many standard data structures, our method uses an ""average"" to represent a large set (Le., cluster) of objects, thus allowing the search to disregard an unpromising subset with only one comparison to its average. Our contribution lies in choosing the average: Inspired by information theory, we choose a representative that is optimally ""close"" in a minimax sense to all members of its set when measured using the Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence. We present a texture retrieval system and test it on the CUReT database, measuring accuracy and efficiency. We find that using the KL-center yields speed ups of more than a factor of three over an exhaustive search while guaranteeing identical accuracy. The KL-center also out-performs other commonly used representatives such as the arithmetic mean.

This technique allows to reach a very fast sampling of the TACs and has been applied in renal studies for the determination of the blood pool input function and of the renal TACs (sampling interval: 0.67 sec). A simple data analysis method has been developed for the estimation of the renal clearance values directly from the comparison of these curves. The approach is in principle analogous to the conventional one of fitting the tracer kinetic model to the TACs generated from the ROIs segmented on a temporal series of images, but, the new fast sampling procedure is not affected by the problems of inconsistency of data and unbiased estimates can be retrieved. The method has been compared with the Direct Least Squares Estimation (DLSE) one and it has shown many advantages both under the computational and the theoretical aspects. The number of equations is strongly reduced and iterative estimation can be avoided; the number of unknowns is reduced too, since the method does not require the description, often not realistic at all, of the tracer behavior in regions different from kidneys and blood.

Currently, a number of edge-based techniques have been proposed in the literature for detecting abrupt shot boundaries to avoid the influence of flashlights common in many video types, such as sports, news, entertainment, and interviews videos. However, these techniques are susceptible to miss and false detections of abrupt shot changes. Our study shows that one main reason for these errors is due to the presence of superimposed texts that are common in various video genres. To address this problem, we present in this paper an efficient method that utilizes the edge type - text-edge (edge in text region) or non-text-edge (edge in non-text region) - to reduce erroneous detection due to the sudden appearance and disappearance of superimposed text. Extensive experiments have been conducted and the results show that our proposed method, as compared with other existing methods, can obtain better performance in detecting abrupt shot boundaries and differentiating them from the effects of superimposed text.","0098-3063;00983063","","10.1109/TCE.2005.1468004","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468004","","Cameras;Content based retrieval;Data analysis;Detectors;Explosives;Gunshot detection systems;Image edge detection;Indexing;Information retrieval;TV broadcasting","content-based retrieval;edge detection;image retrieval;indexing","content-based video indexing;edge detection;enhanced shot boundary detection;video retrieval;video text information","","5","","21","","","May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A three-phase load flow program is applied to solve feeder loss for different scenarios of input neurons to create the training data set for the neural network. The Levenburg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is used for ANN to derive the neural based simplified loss model of distribution feeders. Two distribution feeders of Taipower system are selected for computer simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for distribution system loss analysis.

Using the USER_DATA of picture header, the video output bitstreams by our method still conform to the conventional MPEG decoding system. The proposed method provides a solution toward upgrading the existing MPEG codec with low complexity to accomplish at least two major advantages.

In the literature, a well-known dimension reduction algorithm is linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The common aspect of previously proposed LDA-based algorithms is the use of singular value decomposition (SVD). Due to the difficulty of designing an incremental solution for the eigenvalue problem on the product of scatter matrices in LDA, there has been little work on designing incremental LDA algorithms that can efficiently incorporate new data items as they become available. In this paper, we propose an LDA-based incremental dimension reduction algorithm, called IDR/QR, which applies QR decomposition rather than SVD. Unlike other LDA-based algorithms, this algorithm does not require the whole data matrix in main memory. This is desirable for large data sets. More importantly, with the insertion of new data items, the IDR/QR algorithm can constrain the computational cost by applying efficient QR-updating techniques. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the IDR/QR algorithm in terms of classification error rate on the reduced dimensional space. Our experiments on several real-world data sets reveal that the classification error rate achieved by the IDR/QR algorithm is very close to the best possible one achieved by other LDA-based algorithms. However, the IDR/QR algorithm has much less computational cost, especially when new data items are inserted dynamically.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1490528","Index Terms- Dimension reduction;QR Decomposition;Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).;incremental learning;linear discriminant analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational efficiency;Data mining;Data preprocessing;Databases;Error analysis;Information retrieval;Linear discriminant analysis;Matrix decomposition;Singular value decomposition","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;singular value decomposition;statistical analysis;very large databases","IDR;LDA-based incremental dimension reduction algorithm;QR decomposition;QR-updating technique;classification error rate;data mining;data preprocessing;eigenvalue problem;incremental learning;linear discriminant analysis;scatter matrices;singular value decomposition","","56","","37","","","Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This characterization consists of building identification and height estimation. Initially, a polarimetric interferometric segmentation is performed to isolate buildings from their surroundings. This classification identifies three basic categories: single bounce, double bounce, and volume diffusion. In order to compensate for the misclassifications among the volume and the double-bounce classes, interferometric phases given by the high-resolution Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) method are analyzed. Once buildings are localized, a phase-to-height procedure is applied to retrieve building height information. The method is validated using E-SAR, German Aerospace Center (DLR) fully polarimetric SAR data, at L-band, repeat-pass mode, over the Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, test site, with a spatial resolution of 1.5 m in range and azimuth. More than 80% of buildings are retrieved with acceptably accurate height estimates.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2005.851543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468096","Building characterization;Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT);classification;interferometry;polarimetry","Aerospace testing;Azimuth;Information retrieval;L-band;Parameter estimation;Phase estimation;Signal analysis;Spatial resolution;Synthetic aperture radar;Synthetic aperture radar interferometry","building;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","0.23 m;ESPRIT method;Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques;Germany;L-band polarimetric interferometric SAR data;Oberpfaffenhofen test site;building characterization technique;building height estimation;building identification;misclassifications;polarimetric interferometric segmentation;single bounce;synthetic aperture radar;volume diffusion","","44","","12","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Wind speeds are retrieved from calibrated SAR normalized radar cross section (NRCS) as well as uncalibrated SAR intensity images. In case of the calibrated NRCS the well-tested empirical C-band scatterometer (SCAT) model CMOD4 is used, which describes the dependency of the NRCS on wind. Therefore the SAR data are calibrated, which is performed by utilizing a subset of co-located ERS-2 SCAT data. SAR derived wind speeds are compared to co-located winds from the ERS-2 SCAT and model results of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). The comparison to ERS-2 SCAT results in a correlation of 0.95 with a bias of -0.01 ms<sup>-1</sup> and a root mean square error of 1.0 ms<sup>-1</sup>. In case of SAR intensities a Neural Network (NN) is used that allows to retrieve wind speeds from uncalibrated SAR images.

The Euler number of a binary image is a well-known topological feature, which remains invariant under translation, rotation, scaling, and rubber-sheet transformation of the image. The Euler vector comprises a 4-tuple, where each element is an integer representing the Euler number of the partial binary image formed by the gray-code representation of the four most significant bit planes of the gray-tone image. Computation of Euler vector requires only integer and Boolean operations. The Euler vector is experimentally observed to be robust against noise and compression. For efficient image indexing, storage and retrieval from an image database using this vector, a bucket searching technique based on a simple modification of Kd-tree, is employed successfully. The Euler vector can also be used to perform an efficient four-dimensional range query. The set of retrieved images are finally ranked on the basis of Mahalanobis distance measure. Experiments are performed on the COIL database and results are reported. The retrieval success can be improved significantly by augmenting the Euler vector by a few additional simple shape features. Since Euler vector can be computed very fast, the proposed technique is likely to find many applications to content-based image retrieval.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.846642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468251","Content-based image retrieval (CBIR);Euler number;Mahalanobis distance;feature extraction;range query","Content based retrieval;Image coding;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image storage;Indexing;Information retrieval;Noise robustness;Shape;Spatial databases","Gray codes;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;visual databases","Boolean operation;Euler vector;Gray-code representation;Gray-tone images;Mahalanobis distance measure;content-based image retrieval;feature extraction;image database;partial binary image;rubber-sheet transformation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photometry;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","10","2","44","","","Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
