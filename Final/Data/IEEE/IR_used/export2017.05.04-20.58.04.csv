Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments on a real web-dataset collected from Regione Lazio Portal. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study centered on using social bookmarking and tagging techniques for personalization of web search and its evaluation in a real-world scenario.","","POD:978-1-4244-5334-4","10.1109/CSE.2009.492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283040","","Artificial intelligence;Automation;Collaboration;Computer science;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Sorting;Tagging;Uniform resource locators;Web search","Internet;matrix algebra;query processing;social networking (online)","Regione Lazio Portal;URL;data sharing;data sorting;matrix technique models;personalized Web search;query expansion;real Web-dataset;social bookmarking;social networks;social tagging","","6","1","13","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a new architectural approach in building a distributed context-aware acquisition middleware which supports application adaptation to the environment changes. The architecture is based on the possibility to integrate different context providers in a way that is transparent for the end-user. The complexity of the context providers is hidden to the client application. The middleware provides both a transparent mechanism which is used to monitor the environment changes and a simple query language to interrogate the system for given target context values. Comparing our proposed middleware against the requirements of a pervasive context-aware application, it proves to be a feasible solution for building context-aware pervasive applications.","","POD:978-1-4244-5007-7","10.1109/ICCP.2009.5284736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284736","context awareness;invisibility;pervasive computing","Buildings;Computer architecture;Context awareness;Context modeling;Context-aware services;Information filtering;Information retrieval;Middleware;Monitoring;Sensor systems and applications","fault tolerant computing;middleware;query languages;ubiquitous computing","application adaptation;context-aware adaptability;distributed context provisioning;distributed context-aware acquisition middleware;pervasive environment;query language;reaction middleware;transparent mechanism","","0","","9","","","27-29 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study the lookup performance of locating nodes responsible for replicated information in Kad - one of the largest DHT networks existing currently. Throughout the measurement study, we found that Kad lookups locate only 18% of nodes storing replicated data. This failure leads to limited reliability and an inefficient use of resources during lookups. Ironically, we found that this poor performance is due to the high level of routing table similarity, despite the relatively high churn rate in the network. We propose solutions which either exploit the high routing table similarity or avoid the duplicate returns using multiple target keys.","2161-3559;21613559","Electronic:978-1-4244-5067-1; POD:978-1-4244-5066-4","10.1109/P2P.2009.5284547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284547","","Bandwidth;Cities and towns;Convergence;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Organizing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Publishing;Routing","distributed processing;table lookup","DHT network;Kad lookup failure;decentralized lookup;distributed hash table;duplicate returns;lookup performance;object mapping;replicated data;replicated information;routing table similarity;structured overlay network service","","13","","14","","","9-11 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify the video shot into three categories: cut transition(CT), gradual transition(GT) and normal sequences (NF). To enhance the robustness of the algorithm, we form the feature vector from all frames within a temporal window.

An alternative widely discussed is the use of randomized search techniques. Several previous researches have been showed that the use of randomized sampling in query optimization permits to find, in average, near optimal plans in polynomial time. However, due to their random components, the quality of yielded plans for the same query may vary a lot, making the response time of a submitted query unpredictable. On the other hand, the use of heuristic optimization may increase stability of response time. This characteristic is essential in environments where response time must be predicted. In this paper, we will compare a randomized algorithm and a heuristic algorithm applied to large join query optimization. We used an open source DBMS as experimental framework and we compared the quality and stability of these algorithms.","","POD:978-1-4244-5021-3","10.1109/ISCIS.2009.5291898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5291898","","Costs;Delay;Genetic algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Query processing;Relational databases;Sampling methods;Search methods;Stability","computational complexity;public domain software;query processing;randomised algorithms;relational databases","exhaustive search methods;large join query optimization;open source DBMS;polynomial time;randomized sampling;randomized search technique;relational database model;search space","","2","","19","","","14-16 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider data broadcast with network coding in real-time on-demand broadcast environments. We analyze the coding problem in on-demand broadcast and transform it into the problem of finding the maximum clique in graph theory. Based on our analysis, a novel algorithm called ADC is proposed. ADC considers both request overlapping and request timing requirement in request scheduling and fully exploits information about clients' cached and requested data items to implement a flexible coding mechanism. The advantages of our proposed algorithm over other traditional and coding assisted broadcast algorithms are shown through simulation results.

In this paper we propose a user-side solution within the context of keyword based search. We model the search privacy threat as an information inference problem and show how to inject noise into user queries to minimize privacy breaches. The search privacy breach is measured as the mutual information between real user queries and the diluted queries seen by search engines. We give the lower bound for the amount of noise queries required by a perfect privacy protection and provide the optimal protection given the number of noise queries. We verify our results with a special case where the number of noise queries is equal to the number of user queries. The simulation result shows that the noise given by our approach greatly reduces privacy breaches and outperforms random noise.

The stability issues related to such a feedback loop are addressed by a mathematical model, connecting statistical and control-theoretic aspects of the system. We test it on real-world tasks, showing that indeed this agent can improve its translation performance autonomously and in a stable fashion, when seeded with a very small initial training set.

However, except hybrid spill-tree, the existing high-dimensional indexing schemes are not efficient in terms of retrieval performance because they are weak in either retrieval accuracy or retrieval time. Therefore, we, in this paper, propose a new efficient high-dimensional indexing scheme to satisfy userspsila requirements by supporting the content-based retrieval of a large amount of video data.

This talk will explore the use of motion information in video surveillance. We will focus primarily on retrieval and activity recognition of motion events in video and sensor databases characterized by multiple interactive motion trajectories. We will present a framework based on tensor decomposition for indexing and retrieval of multiple motion trajectories in video databases. An efficient method for extraction and insertion of partial information in video databases used for multiple motion trajectory representation based on high-order singular value decomposition of tensors will also be provided. We will present a solution to classification and activity recognition of multiple interactive motion trajectories by deriving an extension of hidden Markov models to multiple dimensions. A closed-form solution for the training and classification general forward-backward, expectation-maximization, and Viterbi algorithms for multiple dimensions will be provided for causal systems. An approach to multiple motion trajectory classification and activity recognition based on distributed multidimensional hidden Markov models will be presented for non-causal systems. We will finally introduce a new approach to view-invariance of motion trajectories for unknown and moving cameras based on a null-space matrix representation of motion trajectory information. We will also extend the null-space representation to tensors for view-invariant indexing and retrieval of multiple motion trajectories from unknown and moving cameras.

This method is based on cosine similarity calculation between concept vectors of documents obtained from a taxonomy of words that captures IS-A relations. The calculation of semantic similarities between documents is a very time consuming task, since it is necessary first to calculate semantic similarities between each pair of words that appear on different documents. In this paper, we present a new method to calculate semantic similarities between documents which results in faster computational time. Both a taxonomy based semantic similarity and cosine similarity are employed. First, the concept vectors of documents are obtained by extending the terms in the document vectors with their corresponding IS-A concepts. Cosine similarity is then calculated between those concept vectors of documents. Thus, the overall similarity between documents is a combination of cosine similarity and semantic similarity. The proposed semantic similarity is tested in document clustering problem. The experimental results show that our method achieves a good performance.","","POD:978-1-4244-5021-3","10.1109/ISCIS.2009.5291865","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5291865","","Computational complexity;Frequency;Information retrieval;Internet;Recommender systems;Search engines;Taxonomy;Testing;Web sites;World Wide Web","document handling","IS-A concepts;concept vectors;cosine measure;cosine similarity calculation;documents similarity;taxonomy-based semantic similarity","","8","","23","","","14-16 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the number of ontologies are made publicly available and accessible on the Web increases steadily, a single ontology is no longer enough to support the tasks envisaged by a distributed environment like the semantic Web. Multiple ontologies need to be accessed for several applications. A critical issue is ontology integration, which can largely improve the efficiency to enrich such a domain ontology with less time and lower cost for obtaining related knowledge.

Our system provides a dynamic construction function of search engine components based on a vector space model. In order to reflect the user's current working contexts in the components of the search engine, our system selects adaptively pre-defined sets of feature terms with different search domains depending on the user's currently-viewed documents. By exploiting such adaptive and heterogeneous document vector spaces with specific domains, our system allows users to retrieve proper documents that match their current working contexts. Also, our system implements a conventional database selection method to reduce the computation time of the similarity calculations in each document vector space. In this study, we confirm that our adaptive search system can improve the precision rates of search results as well as the scalability of computation times, by several experiments using the experimental retrieval system implemented in the desktop environment.","1555-5798;15555798","POD:978-1-4244-4560-8","10.1109/PACRIM.2009.5291375","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5291375","","Adaptive systems;Computer networks;Data mining;Distributed databases;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Scalability;Search engines;Space technology;Spatial databases","document handling;feature extraction;query processing;search engines;set theory","adaptive search system;computation time reduction;conventional database selection algorithm;desktop environment;document retrieval process;dynamic construction function;experimental retrieval system;feature term set selection;heterogeneous document vector space;search engine component","","0","1","14","","","23-26 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Having power usage tightly managed ensures a long operational life for the node in cases where replenishments (either via recharge or battery change) are difficult or impossible. The basic deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks consists of sensing nodes as well as a relay node (i.e., sink) which collects sensory data to be relayed via a reliable network. The sink node can become unreachable due to malfunction, scheduled uptime or, in the case of mobile sink nodes, due to being out of the sensor nodespsila reach. In addition, the sensor nodes may decide against relaying data for some period. In these cases, optimal use of sensor node memory space also becomes critical. In this article, we classify data types and establish a set of node level approaches that can be taken to make the most of limited data storage via a prioritized data reduction. We conclude that such a methodology enables the node to be useful by collecting data beyond the point where its data storage size would otherwise allow.","2163-9019;21639019","POD:978-1-4244-4772-5","10.1109/ICSNC.2009.109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5279428","networks;operations;sensor;storage","Costs;Energy management;Energy storage;Engines;Information retrieval;Memory;Relays;Routing protocols;Space technology;Wireless sensor networks","storage allocation;wireless sensor networks","mobile sink nodes;network protocol stack;power usage;prioritized data reduction;relay node;sensing nodes;wireless sensor networks","","2","","11","","","20-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Text-based search engines fall short in retrieving such those information. For example, when a user search for x(y+z) using Google, Google retrieves documents that have xyz, x+y=z, (x+y+z)=xyz or any other document that contains x, y, and/or z but not x(y+z). Google ignores the structure of the expression x(y+z). The structure of certain math expression conveys the correct interpretation of that expression. Text-based search engines have achieved a good level of maturity in refining text search. Unfortunately those search engines did not achieve the same progress in terms of mathematical contents as a separate distinguished type of text. The major obstacle to math search in current text search systems is that those systems do not differentiate between a user query that contains a mathematical expression and any other query that contains text term. Therefore, they process mathematical expressions as other texts, regardless of its nature of being well-structured and having properties that make it different from other forms of text. Here, in this context we benefit from the concept of digital ecosystems to refine the text search process to be applicable in searching for a mathematical expression by implementing a system that is responsible for detecting equivalent math expressions. Actually, we will add more algorithms to the Information Retrieval System in order to make it suitable to do search for a mathematical expression as well as other forms of text.","2150-4938;21504938","POD:978-1-4244-2345-3","10.1109/DEST.2009.5276728","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276728","","Computer science;Databases;Ecosystems;Information retrieval;Information systems;Reliability engineering;Search engines;Thesauri","Web services;grammars;information retrieval;mathematical operators;mathematics computing;search engines;search problems;text analysis","Google;Web information;digital ecosystems;expanded grammar;information retrieval system;mathematical contents;mathematical expressions;structured information;text search process;text-based search engines;user query","","1","2","13","","","1-3 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a two-level indexing structure built on distributed hash table (DHT) aiming to support range queries on high-dimensional feature space in peer-to-peer network. Unlike most existing systems, where every node is responsible for a data partition, our design only utilizes a small part of the nodes to manage partitions. These partition nodes form the first level index. The second level index consists of one or more server nodes, which maintains links to each partition node. Additionally, a merge and split mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the workload among nodes. Experimental results indicate that our system offers promising performance in terms of workload balance in churn networks. The flexibility to work with any DHT and the capability to support multiple feature spaces further make our proposed approach a feasible extension for file sharing networks.","","POD:978-1-4244-4463-2","10.1109/MMSP.2009.5293339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5293339","","Content based retrieval;Filling;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Multidimensional systems;Network servers;Partitioning algorithms;Peer to peer computing;Robustness","cryptography;peer-to-peer computing","churn networks;data partition;distributed hash table;file sharing networks;high-dimensional range queries;merge and split mechanism;peer-to-peer networks;two-level indexing","","1","","11","","","5-7 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We demonstrate the capability of the proposed technique by conducting experiments on video images containing both graphics text and scene text with different font shapes and sizes, languages, text directions, background and contrasts.

Visual codebooks are generated from the region clusters of low level features. These codebooks are then, matched with the words of the text document related to the image, in various ways. In this paper, we supervise the clustering process by using three types of side information. The first one is the topic probability information obtained from the text document associated with the image. The second is the orientation and the third one is the color information around each interest point. The side information provides a set of constraints in a semi-supervised k-means region clustering algorithm. Consequently, in clustering of regions not only low level features, but also this extra information is used. Experimental results show that image annotation with semi-supervision of side information is more successful compared to the one that uses low level features alone. Moreover, a speedup is obtained in the modified k-means algorithm because of the constraints.

To achieve all the desires, we propose a scheme - H2S by making use of both homomorphic secret sharing and homomorphic encryption.

Spectral derivatives at the slopes of the 970 nm and 1200 nm water absorption features offer good potential as estimators for CWC. An extensively grazed fen meadow is used as test site in this study. Results are compared with simulations with the PROSAIL radiative transfer model. The first derivative at the left slope of the feature at 970 nm is found to be highly correlated with CWC and the relationship corresponds to the one found with PROSAIL simulations. Use of the derivative over the 940 - 950 nm interval is suggested. In order to avoid interference with absorption by atmospheric water vapour, the potential of estimating CWC using the first derivative at the right slope of the 970 nm absorption feature is recommended. Correlations are a bit lower than those at the left slope, but better than those obtained with water band indices, as shown in previous studies. FieldSpec measurements show that one may use derivatives around the middle of the right slope within the interval between 1015 nm and 1050 nm.","2158-6268;21586268","POD:978-1-4244-4686-5","10.1109/WHISPERS.2009.5289058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5289058","Remote sensing;canopy water content;hyperspectral;spectral derivatives;water absorption features","Absorption;Atmospheric modeling;Content based retrieval;Ecosystems;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Information retrieval;Interference;Remote sensing;Testing","regression analysis;sorption;vegetation mapping","FieldSpec measurements;PROSAIL radiative transfer model;atmospheric water vapour;canopy water content;hyperspectral remote sensing data;terrestrial ecosystems;water absorption features","","1","","15","","","26-28 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a new method for computing Abduction over complex concept descriptions in the expressive Description Logic SH. Our proposal divides the abduced concept in pieces, which allow for direct and concise explanations. The approach exploits information within a prefixed tableau to compute solutions that take into account the structure of a formula. Hypotheses are pieces of a formula to be added inside the quantifiers of a complex concept description and not just added as outermost conjunctions. we propose suitable definitions of the problem, algorithms and calculus. we also give some hints on how to fruitfully use the proposed technique to provide rankings in the matchmaking process.","","POD:978-0-7695-3801-3","10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5285144","abduction;description logics;matchmaking;tableaux","Calculus;Conferences;Fuzzy logic;Hydrogen;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Logic programming;Ontologies;Semantic Web","","","","0","","25","","","15-18 Sept. 2009","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

This is shown using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) data acquired over a forested area in the Sudbury region (Ontario, Canada). Through intensive validation using field data, it is demonstrated that the combination of the hotspot and darkspot reflectances has strong response to changes in vegetation clumping. Furthermore, the model inversion using a LUT approach is employed to retrieve chlorophyll content per unit leaf area. In order to explore the impact of clumping on the chlorophyll content retrieval, we compared the results of the inversion based on leaf area index (LAI) and based on effective LAI (L<sub>e</sub>).

Feature selection is an important task in data analysis. It is useful to limit redundancy of features, promote comprehensibility, and find clusters (or structures) hidden in high dimensional data. This paper addresses the problems of document mining related with Web page clustering and classification using the principle component analysis for feature vector selection.

For the sake of protecting the user data privacy and the user queries privacy, a user should store his personal files in an encrypted form in a cloud, and then sends queries in the form of encrypted keywords. However, a simple encryption scheme may not work well when a user wants to retrieve only files containing certain keywords using a thin client. First, the user needs to encrypt and decrypt files frequently, which depletes too much CPU capability and memory power of the client. Second, the service provider couldn't determine which files contain keywords specified by a user if the encryption is not searchable. Therefore, it can only return back all the encrypted files. A thin client generally has limited bandwidth, CPU and memory, and this may not be a feasible solution under the circumstances. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of cloud computing and propose an efficient privacy preserving keyword search scheme in cloud computing. It allows a service provider to participate in partial decipherment to reduce a client's computational overhead, and enables the service provider to search the keywords on encrypted files to protect the user data privacy and the user queries privacy efficiently.

The main problem arises from the ever increasing mass of digital media and the lack of efficient methods for indexing and retrieval of such data based on the semantic content rather than keywords. To enable intelligent web interactions or even web filtering, we need to be capable of interpreting the information base in an intelligent manner. Research has been ongoing for a few years in the field of ontological engineering with the aim of using ontologies to add knowledge to information. In this paper we describe the architecture of a system designed to automatically and intelligently index huge repositories of special effects video clips, based on their semantic content, using a network of scalable ontologies to enable intelligent retrieval.","","POD:978-0-7695-3801-3","10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5285025","Automatic Labelling;Knowledge Representation;Natural Language Processing;Ontology;Topic Map Technology","Content based retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Knowledge representation;Labeling;Materials testing;Ontologies;Prototypes","","","","1","","11","","","15-18 Sept. 2009","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Existing approaches for compressing and encrypting large XML documents provide a non-queriable intermediate document representation, creating a need to decompress and decrypt the whole document before any access, which simply wastes computing resources (such as memory, time, and power) especially in mobile environment. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a new approach for compressing and encrypting large XML documents while maintaining queriability over the intermediate document representation. The proposed approach separates document structure from its contents using a variation of the Ctree XML indexing approach (known as the Ctree<sup>+</sup>), then applies context-free lossless encryption and compression techniques over the resulting Ctree<sup>+</sup> intermediate representations. Experiments results show that the proposed approach dramatically enhances queries response times when compared with existing approaches. However, the proposed approach provides lesser compression ratios when compared with context-based compression techniques.","","POD:978-1-4244-5021-3","10.1109/ISCIS.2009.5291834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5291834","","Books;Cryptography;Data engineering;Data structures;Database languages;Delay;Indexing;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;XML","XML;cryptography;data compression;indexing;query processing","Ctree XML indexing approach;XML data compression;XML data encryption;context-based compression;context-free lossless compression;context-free lossless encryption;document representation;mobile environment;nonqueriable intermediate document representation","","4","","9","","","14-16 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A quantitative approach to semantic knowledge representation is adopted in the form of semantic space models computed from these free text documents.

Such environment results in configuration differences among individual resources forcing users that access those resources to deal with the variability in resource configurations. This behaviour breaks the concept of interpreting the grid as a unified entity and forces the users to think of the grid in terms of individual resources. Concretely, this variability is expressed through the requirement for the users to explicitly state application installation properties on individual resources during each job submission. This is a tedious, error-prone and unnecessary process that acts as a barrier in the use of the grid. In this paper, a tool named GridAtlas is presented that keeps up with the details of individual resource and application configurations and makes such data easily accessible from a well-known location through Web-service API calls or a Web interface.

This paper focus on the topic of estimation and analysis of land surface water and heat fluxes in mountain-plain area based on remote sensing and DEM, selecting Sunan Mountain and Zhangye Plain in China as a case study. All the biophysical parameters quantitatively retrieved from ASTER data were as the inputs of SVAT-based model-SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System), to derive the latent heat flux and daily evaporation, in which the parameterization schemes for calculating the instantaneous solar radiation and daily integrated radiation were improved by accounting for the variations in slope and azimuth of land surface and terrain shadow in mountainous areas. After preliminary validation and comparison, we consider that the estimation of land surface water and heat fluxes as well as daily evaporation shows a reliable result, which also implies that the parameterization methods and SEBS model are feasible. Then the spatial patterns of land surface heat fluxes as well as daily evaporation on these two landform systems were cross-compared. Different types of land use land cover (LULC) have their corresponding threshold concentrations, and the high vegetation density corresponds to high evaporation (daily evaporation ranges from 0 mm to 7.524 mm day<sup>-1</sup>). Forest, prairie and grassland, irrigated field have higher daily evaporation, while cold desert, Gobi and droughty riverside land have low daily evaporation, some of which reach to 0 mm. Results show that land surface heterogeneity has great influence on the spatial pattern of land surface water and heat fluxes, and vegetation coverage influence surface water and heat's characteristic, which figures that it is better to introduce vegetation fraction and Ts to describe land surface water and heat fluxes rather than the commonly used NDVI-Ts, though needed further analysis a- nd validation. Besides the vegetation coverage, terrain complexity dominates the spatial distribution of land surface heat fluxes in mountainous area, which are distinctly different from plain in quantity and spatial law. The standard deviation of the net radiation flux error and latent heat flux error are almost linearly with the standard deviation of height. In certain range, they have significant correlativity with the standard deviation of slope and aspect. These correlations with net radiation flux are even more obviously. In addition, the utility and limitations of SEBS's applicability to watersheds with various land cover types and complex terrain were analyzed.","2161-024X;2161024X","POD:978-1-4244-4562-2","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2009.5293514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5293514","DEM;Land surface water and heat fluxes;Remote sensing;SEBS(Surface Energy Balance System);Terrain complexity;Vegetation coverage","Biological system modeling;Geoscience;Information retrieval;Land surface;Meteorology;Remote monitoring;Remote sensing;Surface topography;Vegetation mapping;Water heating","terrain mapping","ASTER data;SVAT-based model-SEBS;Sunan Mountain;Zhangye Plain;biophysical parameters;integrated radiation;land surface heat flux;land surface water;land use land cover;mountain-plain area;remote sensing;solar radiation;spatial patterns;surface energy balance system","","0","","6","","","12-14 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the search activity still requires extra efforts in order to get satisfactory results. One of the reasons is heterogeneous information resources and exponential growth of information. The problem of heterogeneity arises as a result of discipline specific language used even in domain specific documents. This particular problem we tackle in this paper. We propose an approach to construct semantic-linguistic feature vectors (FV). The FVs are built based on domain semantics encoded in an ontology and enhanced by a relevant terminology from documents on the Web. Semantic information from the ontologies is also used to expand the user queries and the FVs are used to filter and rank the retrieved documents. The strength of this approach is twofold. First, it is grounded on relevant semantics from an ontology, and second, it accounts for statistically significant collocations of other terms and phrases in relation to the ontology entities. In this paper, we explain how these FVs are constructed and what effect they have on search performance.","","POD:978-0-7695-3801-3","10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.248","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284945","Feature Vector Construction;Ontology;Web Search","Conferences;Industrial economics;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Information science;Intelligent agent;Ontologies;Terminology;Web search","","","","1","","20","","","15-18 Sept. 2009","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

There are already lots of OpenAPIs and the number of OpenAPI increases in very fast pace. So it is difficult to find a service that we want to use, and also difficult to find services for making mash-up services. In this paper, we developed retrieval methods for OpenAPIs and mash-up capable services based on similarity comparison.

Inspired information processing in biology immune system is a highly parallel and distributed intelligent computation which has learning, memory, and associative retrieval capabilities. The architecture of multi-agent in depth defence based on immune principle is proposed. The agents of intrusion detection detect all intrusion which passes by the agent, including known and unknown. The information of new intrusion, which gotten from current monitored network is encapsulated and sent to the other network as vaccine by mobile agents. So the other network can prevent the same intrusion. Intrusion packets are prevented from gateway of intrusion source by response agent.

Instead of relying on high quality and large quantity sample data which is very difficult to obtain, in this paper, a novel method is proposed to achieve improvement in measuring concept similarity by incorporating concept modeling technique into data pruning process. At first, a number of sampling concept models are obtained by sampling a subset from the sample dataset of each concept. Then noisy samples are discarded in terms of their probabilities to the sampling concept models. Experimental results on 31,275 Web images of 38 concepts defined in LSCOM indicate that the concept similarity obtained through our proposed approach is more coherent to human cognition. A concept hierarchy tree built from the 38 concepts with their similarity further demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.","","POD:978-1-4244-4463-2","10.1109/MMSP.2009.5293285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5293285","","Asia;Cognition;Humans;Image retrieval;Image sampling;Information retrieval;Information technology;Natural language processing;Noise measurement;Search engines","Gaussian processes;data handling;image processing;trees (mathematics)","Web images;concept modeling technique;data pruning process;human cognition;multimedia retrieval;natural language processing;sampling concept models;semantic similarity;visual domain","","0","","18","","","5-7 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We believe that Internet requires a reputation facility that derives the reputation of peers from evidences over the Internet. In this paper, we propose RepCom, a novel reputation composition architecture to collect, transform and combine trust evidences among P2P communities. RepCom introduces the reputation authority network (RAN) to publish, search and retrieve evidences of peers, and uses a logic-based engine to transform ad hoc evidence data into computable local evidence rules. Finally, RepCom combines the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and weighted score method (WSM) to compute the final composite reputation of peers that comprehensively reflects their global behavior and certified attributes.","","POD:978-1-4244-5334-4","10.1109/CSE.2009.330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283026","P2P;Reputation Composition;TrustCom","Business;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Information retrieval;Internet;Multiagent systems;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Radio access networks;Search engines","Internet;decision making;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security","Internet;RepCom;analytic hierarchy process;peer reputation;peer-to-peer community;reputation authority network;reputation composition architecture;reputation facility;trust evidence;weighted score method","","1","","32","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture efficiently supports multidimensional range queries by mapping the peer identifiers into the property space of the stored objects. The potential disadvantage of not balancing the load on the peers which may be caused by this approach in the case of a static topology is addressed by introducing a dynamic topology, which attempts to balance the storage load.

A scalable indexing architecture that works indifferently with smart or classical camera networks as well as for real-time or a posteriori indexing has been designed and implemented. We introduce the concept of online generic indexing strategy (OGIS) aimed at systematically enriching each video stream with real-time extracted generic metadata allowing to dramatically decrease post-event investigation time. The indexing strategy relies on the systematic detection, tracking and characterization of all observed moving objects. Semantic and non semantic metadata produced by embedded or distributed video analytics modules can be used either to browse the distributed video databases or as inputs to higher level characterization modules (object identification, multi-camera back-tracking, event recognition...). Once a first observation of an object of interest has been found, it can be forward and backward tracked thanks to an interactive multi-stream player taking into account the multi-camera context. Our platform has been assessed on the NGSIM and I-LIDS datasets which consist of real heavy traffic images, showing both high recall and high detection rates in its retrieval capabilities.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-4620-9","10.1109/ICDSC.2009.5289366","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5289366","Surveillance Database Mining and Browsing;Video Content Based Indexing;Video Surveillance Forensics","Character recognition;Data security;Distributed databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;Object detection;Real time systems;Smart cameras;Streaming media;Video surveillance","data mining;database indexing;image retrieval;video databases;video surveillance","EADS UrbanVIEW indexing;mining platform;multicamera context;online generic indexing;scalable indexing architecture;semantic browsing;video surveillance database","","1","","21","","","Aug. 30 2009-Sept. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The queries are defined as geometric shapes changing over time. The queries are formulated with geometric objects and operations over them at the first time frame. The atoms coordinates or the distance between atoms can be chosen as time-dependent parameters of the query solid that defines the shape of the spatio-temporal range query. Then, the resulting region inside the spatio-temporal query is visualized as an animated sequence or frame-by-frame. The system application in analysis of molecular dynamics simulation results is discussed. The temporal range queries in our model can be considered as motion classifiers.

Whenever a Web client resolves one of these URLs, the corresponding Web server provides an RDF/ XML or RDFa description of the identified entity. These descriptions can contain links to entities described by other data sources.The Web of Linked Data can be seen as an additional layer that is tightly interwoven with the classic document Web. The author mentions the application of Linked Data in media, publications, life sciences, geographic data, user-generated content, and cross-domain data sources.

In this paper, we first identify nodes that can play key roles from some real-world human mobility and email traces using the traditional social network metrics.

Thus, sophisticated data integration and mining tools are required so domain scientists can more easily retrieve answers to their queries. To address these requirements, we have proposed a Web content query refinement framework integrating both ontology and Web mining techniques to assist the material domain scientists. We used the Web ontology language (OWL) to represent structured knowledge about materials. We have used SWRL, the semantic Web rule language, as a high-level query language that uses the implemented OWL based mappings method. The main merit of our proposed solution is that the user can interactively process (accept or reject) the knowledge gathered during the mining process to enrich the ontology base (ontology learning), which leads to better query precision.

A popular approach in the literature is to process the logs stored by Internet Service Providers (ISP), Intranet proxies or Web search engines to extract a query-document bi-partite graph. In this paper, we propose to use a richer data structure which is able to preserve most of the information available in the logs including query refinements, page visits and search activity. In particular, we represent the query refinements as separate transitions between the corresponding query nodes in the graph and we augment the graph by associating one node to each single user. Users are linked to the queries which they have issued and to the documents they have visited. The resulting data structure is a complete representation of the collective search activity performed by the users of a search engine or of an Intranet. The experimental results show that this more powerful representation can be successfully used to improve the quality of query clustering and to discover query suggestions.","","POD:978-0-7695-3801-3","10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5286068","Query Clustering;Query Recommendations;Query Suggestions;User Feedback;Web Logs","Clustering algorithms;Conferences;Data structures;Feedback;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Search engines;Web and internet services;Web mining;Web search","","","","0","32","18","","","15-18 Sept. 2009","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Guillemot","INRIA, Centre Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France","2009 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","20091023","2009","","","1","6","This paper addresses the problem of efficient SIFT-based image description and searches in large databases within the framework of local querying. A descriptor called the bag-of-features has been introduced previously which first vector quantizes SIFT descriptors and then aggregates the set of resulting codeword indices (so-called visual words) into a histogram of occurrence of the different visual words in the image. The aim is to make the image search complexity tractable by transforming the set of local image descriptor vectors into a single sparse vector as sparsity particularly permits efficient inner product calculations. However, aggregating local descriptors into a single histogram decreases the discerning power of the system when performing local queries. In this paper, we propose a new approach that aims to enjoy the complexity benefits of sparsity while at the same time retaining the local quality of the input descriptor vectors. This is accomplished by searching for a sparse approximation of the input SIFT descriptors. The sparse approximation yields a sparse vector per local SIFT descriptor, and helps preserving local description properties by using each sparse-transformed descriptor independently in a voting system to retrieve indexed images. Our system is shown experimentally to perform better than histogram based systems under query locality, albeit at an increased complexity.","","POD:978-1-4244-4463-2","10.1109/MMSP.2009.5293301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5293301","","Aggregates;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Region 7;Vector quantization;Visual databases;Voting","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;query processing;sparse matrices;vector quantisation;vectors","SIFT-based local image description;image search complexity;indexed image retrieval;local image descriptor vectors;local querying;query locality;sparse approximation;sparse representations;sparse-transformed descriptor;vector quantization;visual words;voting system","","5","2","19","","","5-7 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The treatment of these data are typically performed with a wide range of tools, but the understanding of complex biological system by means of gene expression usually requires integrating different types of data from multiple sources and different services and tools. Many efforts are being developed on the new area of scientific workflows in order to create a technology that links both data and tools to create workflows that can easily be used by researchers. Currently technologies in this area aren't mature yet, making arduous the use of these technologies by the researcher. In this paper we present an architecture that helps the researchers to make large-scale gene expression data analysis with cutting edge technologies.

Using a test collection specifically designed for evaluating subtopic retrieval, we found that our algorithm outperformed both other existing search results clustering algorithms and also a search results re-ranking method that emphasized diversity of results (at least for k≫1; i.e., when we are interested in retrieving more than one relevant document per subtopic).

With robustness to image rotation and translation, the 2D histogram avoids the shortcoming of losing the space distribution information in color histogram.

Recently, many researchers have analyzed the color attributes of an image and used it as the features of the images for querying. Color histogram is one of the most frequently used image features in the field of color-based image retrieval. The color histogram is widely used as an important color feature indicating the contents of the images in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. Specifically histogram-based algorithms are considered to be effective for color image indexing. Color histogram describes the global distribution of pixels of an image which is insensitive to variations in scale and easy to calculate. However, the high-resolution color histograms are usually high dimension and contain much redundant information which does not relate to the image contents, while the low-resolution histograms can not provide adequate discriminative information for image classification. And an image often includes a part of colors but not all, So there will be many accounts of colors are zeros. In order to save space, we shouldn't need store them. In this paper, a color high-resolution, non-uniform quantized color histogram is proposed and the improving representation about histogram is proposed too. Major color, major segmentation block, and a new Gray scale co-existing matrixpsilas method are proposed.","","POD:978-0-7695-3744-3","10.1109/IAS.2009.156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283441","Color Histogr;Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR);Image Retrieval;Image Segmentation","Computer security;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Humans;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Pixel;Quantization","image colour analysis;image retrieval;image segmentation;matrix algebra","Gray scale co-existing matrix method;color histogram;color image indexing;color-based image retrieval;content-based image retrieval;segmentation-based image retrieval","","7","1","13","","","18-20 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
