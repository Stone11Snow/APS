Elastic buffering is a proxy management technique devised to decouple the multimedia information retrieval rate on the network backbone from the playout streaming rate at the user terminal. It has been shown in the past that the application of elastic buffering mechanisms in terrestrial networks brings significant advantages in terms of network effectiveness. We show that elastic buffering is an extremely effective means to reduce, or even eliminate, streaming service outage due to intermittent backbone connectivity, such as that occurring when a vehicle moves through tunnels. Moreover, we show that elastic buffering is not only a technique suitable for multimedia information retrieval services, but can be effectively applied to delayed real-time services.","0163-6804;01636804","","10.1109/MCOM.2004.1362558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1362558","","Buffer storage;Delay effects;Digital multimedia broadcasting;Information retrieval;Multimedia communication;Network servers;Prefetching;Spine;Streaming media;TV broadcasting","information retrieval;mobile radio;multimedia communication;radio links;real-time systems;storage management;telecommunication network management","elastic proxy buffer management;intermittent backbone connectivity;mobile networking;multimedia information retrieval rate;proxy management technique;real-time service;satellite backbone link;streaming service outage;terrestrial network;vehicular area network;vehicular user;wireless link","","14","","11","","","Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The paper characterizes the maximum achievable embedding rate, R<sub>e</sub>, (the embedding capacity, C<sub>e</sub>) as a function of the compression (composite) rate R<sub>c</sub> and the allowed average distortion level, Δ, such that the average probability of error in decoding the embedded message can be made arbitrarily small for sufficiently large block length.

Nodes in the RST automatically group registrations based on their values. Queries are decomposed into a small number of sub-queries for efficient resolution. The system dynamically optimizes itself to minimize the registration and query cost based on observed load. The system is fully distributed and avoids bottleneck problems encountered in traditional tree-based systems.

Therefore, in this paper, an OFDM-based wireless system employing layered space-time architecture is considered for a high-rate transmission. With an emphasis on a preamble design for multi-channel separation, we address a channel estimation based on the time-domain windowing and its imperfectness in MIMO-OFDM system. By properly designing each preamble for multiple antennas to be orthogonal in the time domain, the channel estimation can be executed based on semi-blind processing in the case of more than two transmitting antennas. And also we evaluate the PAR performance in the MIMO-OFDM system using the SLM and PTS approaches. The investigated SLM and PTS schemes for MIMO-OFDM signals select the transmitted sequence with lowest average PAR over all transmitting antennas and retrieve the side information very accurately at the expense of a slight degradation of the PAR performance. The low probability of false side information can improve the overall detection performance of the MIMO-OFDM system with erroneous side information compared to the ordinary SLM and PTS approaches, respectively.

Fuzzy logic is used for expressing queries in terms of natural language and a neural network is designed to learn the meaning of these queries. The queries are designed based on features such as colour and texture of shots, scenes and objects in video clips. An error backpropagation algorithm is proposed to learn the meaning of queries in fuzzy terms such as ""very similar"", ""similar"" and ""some-what similar"".

In this paper, we show a prototype application of the framework, context-aware information assist services in a museum.","","POD:0-7695-2225-4","10.1109/SCC.2004.1357996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357996","","Context-aware services;Global Positioning System;Information retrieval;Infrared sensors;Navigation;Physics computing;Prototypes;Ubiquitous computing;Web and internet services;Web services","Internet;humanities;software agents;ubiquitous computing","agent-based coordination framework;context-aware information assist services;human-centered coordinating services;location-mediated Web services;museum;ubiquitous computing","","0","","18","","","15-18 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed system creates ambient intelligence in terms of the evaluation of nonprecise, easy to input sketched information. The system can then provide the user with options of either retrieving similar images in the database or ranking the quality of the sketch against a given standard, i.e., the original image model. Alternatively, the inherent pattern-matching capability of the system can be utilized to allow detection of distortion in any given real time-image sequences in vision-driven ambient intelligence applications. The proposed method can cope with images containing several complex objects in an inhomogeneous background. Two abstract images are obtained using strong edges of the model image and the morphologically thinned outline of the sketched image. The angular-spatial distribution of pixels in the abstract images is then employed to extract new compact and effective features using the Fourier transform. The extracted features are rotation and scale invariant and robust against translation. Experimental results from seven different approaches confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in both the retrieval performance and the time required for feature extraction and search.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2004.838464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369343","","Ambient intelligence;Art;Color;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image edge detection;Image matching;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Pixel","Fourier transforms;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image matching;image retrieval;image sequences;visual databases","Fourier transform;ambient intelligence;angular partitioning;angular-spatial pixel distribution;feature extraction;image database;image retrieval;real-time image sequence;rotation invariance;scale invariance;sketch quality ranking;sketch-based image matching","","69","1","38","","","Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Fourth International Conference on","20041130","2004","","","722","729","Wavelet shape descriptors are widely used in shape recognition and retrieval due to their multi-resolution nature and ability to maintain local shape features. Unfortunately, this extra information creates significant problems in the generation of a suitable normalized descriptor for shape matching. Several techniques have been proposed to alleviate this problem, but all have weaknesses which decrease the discriminating capacity. In this paper, a new combined strategy is proposed, which uses shape normalization prior to wavelet processing for translation and scaling, and descriptor normalization for starting point and rotation. Shape reconstruction ability and retrieval capabilities are assessed experimentally and compared to existing approaches using a small database of shapes derived from trademark retrieval research. The combined normalization technique is shown to produce a descriptor that is more perceptually aligned, and hence more accurate for retrieval tasks. In addition this process is lossless; hence the original shape can be perfectly reconstructed.","","POD:0-7695-2216-5","10.1109/CIT.2004.1357280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357280","","Frequency domain analysis;Image databases;Image reconstruction;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Shape;Trademarks;Wavelet domain;Wavelet transforms","image recognition;image reconstruction;image retrieval","combined normalization;descriptor normalization;discriminating capacity;enhanced normalisation;shape features;shape matching;shape normalization;shape recognition;shape reconstruction ability;shape retrieval;shapes database;trademark retrieval research;wavelet shape descriptors","","1","","12","","","14-16 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In CSE, a local search engine located in each Web server makes an index of local pages. And, a meta search server integrates these local search engines to realize a global search engine. CSE takes a few minutes to update index because each local search engine scans all files in its own disk.

A proposed language model (LM), based on a predictive sentence template (PST) tree, integrates a statistical variable n-gram LM and linguistic constraints to deal with the translation problem from ill-formed sign sequences to grammatical written sentences. The PST tree trained by a corpus collected from the deaf schools was used to model the correspondence between signed and written Chinese. In addition, a set of phrase formation rules, based on trigger pair category, was derived for sentence pattern expansion. These approaches improved the efficiency of text generation and the accuracy of word prediction and, therefore, improved the input rate. For the assessment of practical communication aids, a reading-comprehension training program with ten profoundly deaf students was undertaken in a deaf school in Tainan, Taiwan.

"An optimal randomised cell probe lower bound for approximate nearest neighbour searching","A. Chakrabarti; O. Regev","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","45th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","20041213","2004","","","473","482","We consider the approximate nearest neighbour search problem on the Hamming cube {0, 1 }<sup>d</sup>. We show that a randomised cell probe algorithm that uses polynomial storage and word size d<sup>O(1)</sup> requires a worst case query time of Ω (log log d/ log log log d). The approximation factor may be as loose as 2<sup>log 1 - η</sup>d for any fixed η > 0. This generalises an earlier result (Chakrabarti et al., 1999) on the deterministic complexity of the same problem and, more importantly, fills a major gap in the study of this problem since all earlier lower bounds either did not allow randomisation according to Chakrabarti et al. (1999) and Liu (2003) or did not allow approximation according to Borodin et al. (1999), Barkol and Rabani (2000), and Jayram et al. (2003). We also give a cell probe algorithm which proves that our lower bound is optimal. Our proof uses a lower bound on the round complexity of the related communication problem. We show, additionally, that considerations of bit complexity alone cannot prove any nontrivial cell probe lower bound for the problem. This shows that the richness technique (Miltersen et al., 1995) used in a lot of research around this problem would not have helped here.

"Design and performance study of rate staggering storage for scalable video in a disk-array-based video server","Xin-Mao Huang; Cheng-Ru Lin; Ming-Syan Chen","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan","IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","20041130","2004","50","4","1119","1129","This paper provides a data placement method based on rate staggering to store scalable video data in a disk-array-based video server. Scalable video means a video which is coded in such a way that subsets of the full video bit stream can be decoded to create low quality/resolution videos. Supporting layered multiple resolutions from a video server is very desirable in many applications. Note that in a disk array the video data corresponding to different rates of the same video clip are not required to reside in the same disk. In view of this, we propose and explore in this paper the approach of rate staggering, i.e., staggering video data in the disk array based on data rates, it is shown that the advantages of the proposed rate staggering method include: (1) minimizing the intermediate buffer space required by the server, (2) achieving better load balancing due to finer scheduling granularity, and (3) alleviating the disk bandwidth fragmentation. These advantages enable a video server using the rate staggering method to provide feasible solutions to some video stream requests which cannot be met otherwise. The system throughput can thus be increased. We also conduct several simulations for various applications. These experimental results show that the rate staggering method can significantly improve the performance of a VOD system.","0098-3063;00983063","","10.1109/TCE.2004.1362508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1362508","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Bandwidth;Data communication;Information retrieval;Load management;Motion pictures;Network servers;Streaming media;Throughput;Video compression","buffer storage;image resolution;resource allocation;video coding;video discs;video on demand;video servers","VOD system;data placement method;disk bandwidth fragmentation;disk-array-based video server;full video bit stream;intermediate buffer space;layered multiple resolution;rate staggering storage;scalable video data;video coding;video resolution","","3","","26","","","Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Servers consisting of multiple nodes and large arrays of heterogeneous disk drives have become a fact of life for several reasons. First, magnetic disks might fail. Failed disks are almost always replaced with newer disk models because the current technological trend for these devices is one of annual increase in both performance and storage capacity. Second, storage requirements are ever increasing, forcing servers to be scaled up progressively. In this study, we present a framework to enable parity-based data protection for heterogeneous storage systems and to compute their mean lifetime. We describe the tradeoffs associated with three alternative techniques: independent subservers, dependent subservers, and disk merging. The disk merging approach provides a solution for systems that require highly available secondary storage in environments that also necessitate maximum flexibility.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2004.837231","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1359868","65;Continuous media servers;data protection;fault tolerance;heterogeneous storage;high availability;magnetic disk replacement;streaming media servers","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Costs;Displays;Information retrieval;Merging;Nonhomogeneous media;Protection;Redundancy;Streaming media","RAID;disc drives;fault tolerance;magnetic disc storage;multimedia servers;multimedia systems;redundancy;storage management;storage media;video servers","data protection;disk drive;disk merging;fault tolerance;heterogeneous continuous media storage system;independent subserver;magnetic disk replacement;parity-based data protection;streaming media server","","4","","20","","","Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The implementation of interfaces represents a typical instance of this problem. In fact, the code that defines the interface methods is often scattered across several classes in the system and tangled with the original code. Aspect oriented programming provides mechanisms for the dynamic and static composition of transversal functionalities, that can be used to factor out the implementation of interfaces. We describe a technique for the identification of those interface implementations that are most likely to represent crosscutting concerns.

In the case of a mono-service request, the system is designed to reduce the time needed for users to access the information and to preserve the consistency of the replicas. However, when the user requests joint selection of multiple services, synchronization of atomic actions and timeliness have to be assured by the system. The service-oriented autonomous integration and allocation for heterogeneous FIFs to provide one-stop service for users' multiservice requirements are proposed.

After objects are detected and classified, they are grouped based in their interrelations. The graph representing a locally related set of objects is called a ""graphlet"". Graphlets are interconnected into a larger graph which covers an entire set of images. Queries based on graph properties are notoriously difficult due to the inherent complexity of the graph isomorphism and sub-graph isomorphism problems.

On the basis of the SAR image matching with the TM image, the non-volume scattering surface geometric information was obtained from the SPM model at the TM image pixel scale, and the ground pixel surface's equivalent geometric roughness - height standard RMS (Root Mean Square) was achieved from the geometric information by the transformation of the typical topographic factors. The vegetation (wheat, tree) height retrieved from spectrum model was also transferred into its equivalent geometric roughness. A complete two-dimensional distribution map of the equivalent geometric roughness over the experimental area was produced by the data mosaic technique. On the other hand, according to the atmosphere eddy currents theory, the aerodynamic surface roughness was iterated out with the atmosphere stability correction method using the wind and the temperature profiles data measured at several typical fields such as bare soil field and vegetation field.

KASER is a creative expert system. It is capable of deductive, inductive, and mixed derivations. Its qualitative creativity is realized by using a tree-search mechanism. The system achieves creative reasoning by using a declarative representation of knowledge consisting of object trees and inheritance. KASER computes with words and phrases. It possesses a capability for metaphor-based explanations. This capability is useful in explaining its creative suggestions and serves to augment the capabilities provided by the explanation subsystems of conventional expert systems. KASER also exhibits an accelerated capability to learn. However, this capability depends on the particulars of the selected application domain. For example, application domains such as the game of chess exhibit a high degree of geometric symmetry. Conversely, application domains such as the game of craps played with two dice exhibit no predictable pattern, unless the dice are loaded. More generally, we say that domains whose informative content can be compressed to a significant degree without loss (or with relatively little loss) are symmetric. Incompressible domains are said to be asymmetric or random. The measure of symmetry plus the measure of randomness must always sum to unity.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2004.835081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356021","Expert systems;knowledge amplification;machine learning;object-oriented design;randomization","Acceleration;Computer errors;Computer science;Electronic mail;Expert systems;Helium;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Production;Radar","expert systems;knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);object-oriented methods;tree searching","creative reasoning;expert system;knowledge amplification;knowledge representation;machine learning;object-oriented design;structured expert randomization;tree-search mechanism","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Expert Systems;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Statistical;Random Allocation;Software;User-Computer Interface","24","15","30","","","Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, they still have limitations due to temporal and geometric decorrelation. These disturbances strongly compromise the accuracy of the results, but reliable measurements can be obtained over a large multitemporal population of interferograms. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for monitoring temporal evolution of ground surface using several interferograms covering ground movements over a long period of time. It is based on a statistical approach with hypothesis test. The objective of multiple interferograms elevation retrieval is to deal with noisy data. Another important advantage of the multiple image processing is that all baselines (small or large) are considered.

CIHSPS 2004.","20041122","2004","","","31","38","Pattern-matching techniques are important tools to treat problems in several fields, including bioinformatics, case-based reasoning, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. These procedures are important in homeland security and crime prevention because the underlying problems require discovery, in large databases, of instances of patterns known to be associated with illegal activities. While pattern matching may be defined in strict terms as the satisfaction of a logical expression, defining the pattern, by a set of assertions contained in the database, the value of relevant procedures is considerably enhanced by permitting the discovery of approximate matches between database and patterns. The notion of approximate matching is based on soft predicates, which may be satisfied to a degree, rather than the conventional crisp predicates of classical logic. This paper introduces a family of metrics to measure the degree of qualitative match between a database and a pattern, that is, an elastic constraint on database objects and their relations. These metrics provide a formal foundation for the application of graph-editing metrics - measures of the cost associated with graph transformations - to pattern-matching problems. The degree of matching between database and patterns is determined by means of similarity measures that gauge the resemblance between pairs of objects. In our treatment, these measures have a semantic basis stemming from consideration of knowledge structures, such as ontologies, describing common properties of two objects. Approximate pattern matching is treated as the process of modifying databases into a transformed database that strictly satisfies the constraints expressed by the pattern. Associated with each transformation is a measure of admissibility derived from the similarity between the original and transformed databases. The degree of matching of database to pattern is defined as the admissibility of the transformation with highest admissibility value.","","POD:0-7803-8381-8","10.1109/CIHSPS.2004.1360204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1360204","","Artificial intelligence;Data structures;Databases;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Logic;Ontologies;Pattern matching;Pattern recognition;Terrorism","case-based reasoning;data mining;graph theory;information retrieval;object-oriented databases;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;police data processing;relational databases;security;very large databases","admissibility value;approximate matching;bioinformatics;case-based reasoning;classical logic;crime prevention;database editing metrics;database objects;elastic constraint;graph transformations;graph-editing metrics;homeland security;illegal activity pattern;information retrieval;knowledge discovery;knowledge structures;large databases;link analysis;logical expression;object resemblance;ontologies;pattern matching;pattern recognition;semantic similarity measures","","0","","17","","","21-22 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The inversion process has been carried out through two methodologies: a Bayesian and a neural network approach. Two different sets of data have been analyzed: one experiment with active and passive data on a smooth soil and five experiments carried out with a C-band scatterometer on rough and smooth soils at different polarizations and incidence angles. In the case of active and passive data, using a Bayesian algorithm, the correlation coefficients between the extracted and the measured values of soil moisture are R=0.83, R=0.84 and 0.72 for the three analyzed data configurations. In the neural network approach, the correlation coefficients are R=0.72, R=0.83 and 0.79. The best performance is achieved when two different frequencies, 4.6 GHz for active data and 2.5 GHz for passive data are employed where the neural networks produce the lowest errors in the estimates. For the second group of data, the neural network makes fewer mistakes and overestimates only the values of epsiv that originated from backscattering coefficients acquired on the rougher field.

The core GPM satellite will incorporate two separate precipitation radars: one operating at Ku-band (13.6 GHz) and the other at Ka band (35.6 GHz). Each radar beam will be steered such that they both point to the same location in the atmosphere. The main purpose of the dual-frequency radar system is to resolve the DSD in precipitation as well as discriminate between rain and ice. With the two beams collocated on the same precipitation volume, new algorithms are being developed to reliably estimate attenuation and rain rate. Any algorithm is based on models of precipitation. In addition, the GPM system assumes collocated beams and matched resolution volumes. Electromagnetic and microphysical models have been developed based on ground-based dual-frequency radar data at S-band to simulate Ku- and Ka-band results for comparison with the new GPM algorithms. This paper evaluates the dual-frequency inversion algorithm with synthesized S-band and known perfect data and presents results. Results show the expected performance of the new dual-precipitation radar algorithms with the potential for guiding algorithm and system improvements.","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1368560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1368560","","Atmospheric measurements;Attenuation measurement;Hydrologic measurements;Information retrieval;Meteorological radar;Radar measurements;Rain;Reflectivity;Satellites;Spaceborne radar","atmospheric techniques;drops;ice;meteorological radar;rain;spaceborne radar","13.6 GHz;35.6 GHz;DSD resolving;Global Precipitation Measurement;Ku-/Ka-band;S-band ground-based dual-frequency radar data;dual-frequency inversion algorithm;electromagnetic model;global water cycle;high resolution ground radar observation;microphysical model;radar beam steering;rain drop size distribution;rain rate/attenuation estimation;rain-ice discrimination;space borne GPM dual-frequency radar simulation","","2","","10","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to adequate retrieval techniques, it is also important to enable some form of adaptation to users' specific needs. This paper introduces a new refinement method for retrieval based on the learning of the users' specific preferences. The proposed system indexes objects based on shape and groups them into a set of clusters, with each cluster represented by a prototype. Clustering constructs a taxonomy of objects by forming groups of closely-related objects. The proposed approach to learn the users' preferences is to refine corresponding clusters from objects provided by the users in the foreground, and to simultaneously adapt the database index in the background. Queries can be performed based solely on shape, or on a combination of shape with other features such as color. Our experimental results show that the system successfully adapts queries into databases with only a small amount of feedback from the users. The quality of the returned results is superior to that of a color-based query, and continues to improve with further use.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2004.837235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1359862","65;Clustering;digital image retrieval;refinement;shape-based indexing;weighted distance","Content based retrieval;Digital images;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Prototypes;Shape;Spatial databases;Taxonomy","content-based retrieval;database indexing;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;information retrieval systems;multimedia databases;object detection;object-oriented databases;pattern clustering;relevance feedback;visual databases","cluster-driven refinement;clustering constructs;color-based query;content-based digital image retrieval;databases;multimedia object;shape-based indexing;weighted distance","","8","","24","","","Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, we index spatial object only about 1 random frame per second, and index the spatial object in other frames by interpolation. However, when processing video frames with 1-second interval, the low spatial redundancy of spatial objects in the video makes the indexing of spatial objects difficult because object tracking is nearly impossible only with image-based method.

We propose an approach to supporting slicing over both program and database state, which requires the introduction of two new forms of data dependency into the standard program dependency graph.

Current approaches for semantic modeling of multimedia content store the information about the content's semantics and functionality in different files and at different locations, which makes the retrieval and reuse of multimedia content very difficult. We have proposed enhanced multimedia meta objects (EMMOs) as a new means for semantic multimedia modeling that indivisibly combines multimedia content with its description and functionality. In this paper, we give an overview of the structure of EMMA, a query algebra, which is adequate and complete with regard to the EMMO model, enables query optimization, allows the integration of ontology knowledge, and supports distributive collaborative authoring.","","POD:0-7695-2216-5","10.1109/CIT.2004.1357177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357177","","Algebra;Collaboration;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Encoding;Informatics;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantic Web","content-based retrieval;data models;meta data;multimedia databases","EMMA;distributive collaborative authoring;enhanced multimedia meta objects;media data;multimedia contect reuse;multimedia content access;multimedia content retrieval;ontology knowledge;query algebra;query optimization;semantic description;semantic functionality;semantic modeling;semantic multimedia modeling","","0","","13","","","14-16 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Enormous data are sent back to the Earth stations. In deriving surface parameters using these remotely sensed data, the transportability of algorithms from one resolution to another often cause the scale effect because of the surface heterogeneity on the Earth which can induce the change of reflectance. The problem, that the change of reflectance data affected by discontinuity as part of surface heterogeneity impacts the retrieval of vegetation leaf area index (LAI), is addressed in This work. Two cases, inducing the scaling issue in deriving surface parameters of interest, are considered here. One is the discontinuity between contrasting cover types within a mixed scene, the other is the nonlinear relationship of NDVI and LAI. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the correction based on NDVI-LAI relationships to modify scaling problem. In the processing, considering the field of wheat, firstly a series of 3D scenes with wheat and soil mixed are made based on the field measurement; secondly, computer simulation model $the method of radiosity, which can calculate the balance of light energy in the simulated scenes, is used to model BRF (bi-directional reflectance factor) of these scenes. If the NDVI-LAI relationship from homogeneous scenes can be taken as standard, the relationship from heterogeneous scenes will be modified according to contextural parameter. Some conclusions are drawn from the investigation: (1) different distributional contextures of vegetation even with the same LAI affect the reflectance heavily; (2) we compare the reflectance simulated by the method of radiosity with the mean reflectance calculated using the area-weighted linear relationship of reflectance from components, and find that the accuracy of the mean reflectance can be accepted so that the linear equation to calculate the reflectance of mixed pixels is reasonable to relate images with high and low resolution; (3) using contextural parameter for quantifying the scale effect can get promising results.","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369947","","Computer simulation;Earth;Energy measurement;Information retrieval;Layout;Reflectivity;Satellite broadcasting;Satellite ground stations;Soil;Vegetation mapping","geophysical signal processing;image resolution;stereo image processing;vegetation mapping","3D scenes;Earth stations;algorithm transportability;area-weighted linear relationship;bidirectional reflectance factor;computer simulation model;contextural parameter;distributional contextures;field measurement;light energy;linear equation;radiosity;remote sensing;satellite technology;scale effect validation;soil;surface heterogeneity;surface parameters;vegetation leaf area index;wheat","","0","","4","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Water vapour is the most abundant gas of a volcanic plume released into the atmosphere from an active volcanic system. The technique is based on the correlation between the dip in the spectral curve measured by the spectrometer were water vapour absorptions bands are presents, and the precipitable water content in the column. Airborne and satellite remote sensing images in the infrared wavelength range were used. The technique has been applied to data acquired over two different degassing volcanoes. The Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) acquired data over the Hawaiian Pu'u'O'o Vent cone of the Kilauea volcano on April 2000. The Hyperion sensor on EO-1 satellite has been requested to acquire data on July 2003, during a ground-based measurements campaign on Mt. Etna (Italy). The result is the spatial distribution of water vapour abundance of the Mt. Etna and of the Pu'u'O'o Vent volcanic plumes. A comparison between the two results has been done, showing the differences in the volcanic activity.

We then devise a new image similarity metric and develop a prototype system, which identifies the semantic category of the image and retrieves similar images from the database. We tested the metric on a set of new images and compared the categorization results with that of human observers.

The unknown variables elimination in retrieval is by finding the relationships of single scattering albedo (and optical opacity) of vegetation scatter between the same frequency ranges.","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369885","","Frequency measurement;Information retrieval;Optical scattering;Polarization;Remote sensing;Rough surfaces;Samarium;Soil moisture;Surface roughness;Vegetation","albedo;backscatter;data acquisition;hydrological techniques;microwave measurement;moisture measurement;soil;vegetation mapping","AMSR-E;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - EOS;C-band;Ku-band;X-band;emission simulation;multiple scattering effects;optical opacity;single scattering albedo;soil moisture retrieval method;vegetated surface;vegetation scatter;zero-order model","","0","","9","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the expression of structural relations between elements, attributes and texts, we must reconstruct the structure of coordinate. As the reconstruction process proceeds in the index structure overall the XML document without limitation of the number of node in a cascade manner, it is caused a serious performance problem by the frequent update operations. In this paper, we propose an index technique based on an extensible index that does not cause serious performance degradations. It can limit the number of node to participate in reconstruction process and improve lots of performance capacities on the whole. Extensible index with deferred update shows additional performance improvement specially. In addition, the extensible index technique contains the advantage to perform efficiently the containment relationship query through the simple expression, therefore it can maximize the performance of the system.","","POD:0-7695-2216-5","10.1109/CIT.2004.1357209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357209","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Costs;Databases;Degradation;Information retrieval;Internet;SGML;Web sites;XML","XML;content management;content-based retrieval;document handling;indexing;information storage","XML documents;containment relationship query;coordinate-based methods;document retrieval;document storage;extensible index technique;structural relations;update operation","","0","","9","","","14-16 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of this, the dynamic properties of the uniformly-sampled pulse-width modulators used in low power applications become an important restriction for the maximum achievable bandwidth of control loops.

During the last 20 years 17 split window algorithms has been published. These algorithms can be grouped into four categories: emissivity-dependent models, two-factors models, complicated models and radiance model. In this paper we intend to compare these split window algorithms in terms of their computation and accuracy. Two methods are used for the comparison: ground datasets and simulation datasets. Results from comparison shows that different algorithms have different performances under different situations. For simulation datasets, the algorithms of Qin et al. and Sobrino et al. are the best. The average root mean square (RMS) error of the two algorithms is less than 0.3degC. The algorithms of Franca and Cracknell, Prata and Uliverir et al. also have very low RMS errors (0.5-0.7degC). Results from comparison with ground datasets indicates that the algorithms of Qin et al. and Sobrino et al. are among the best for the dataset without precise in situ atmospheric water vapor contents. These algorithms are able to provide LST retrieval with average RMS error less than 1.9degC for the 361 measurements of the two Australian sites. An obvious contrast to the generally higher RMS error for the dataset is the much lower RMS error of the algorithms for the intensive experiments with precise in situ atmospheric water vapor contents. Based on the above two methods for comparison, it can be concluded that, comprehensively, the algorithm of Qin et al. is the best alternative for LST retrieval from AVHRR followed by Sobrino et al., Franca and Cracknell, and Prata when data are available to estimate both emissivity and transmittance","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369935","","Atmospheric modeling;Computational modeling;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Ocean temperature;Remote sensing;Sea surface;Temperature sensors","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric techniques;data acquisition;emissivity;geophysical signal processing;land surface temperature;remote sensing","Australian sites;LST retrieval;NOAA-AVHRR data;RMS error;atmospheric water vapor contents;average root mean square;emissivity-dependent models;ground datasets;land surface temperature retrieval;radiance model;simulation datasets;split window algorithms;transmittance;two-factors models","","0","","19","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model provides quite good results for the estimation in bare soil areas. However, it does not explicitly incorporate vegetation backscatter effects and does not provide good results for vegetated areas with a cross-polarization ratio greater than -11dB. A modified empirical model is developed to address this concern. The water-cloud model is used to introduce vegetation effects into the VV backscatter coefficient, which is further used in the inversion model.

Database and information retrieval communities, on the other hand, employ entity-relation or object-oriented models to model the semantics of multimedia documents. This paper proposes a new generic integrated semantic-syntactic video model to include all of these elements within a single framework to enable structured video search and browsing combining textual and low-level descriptors. The proposed model includes semantic entities (video objects and events) and the relations between them. We introduce a new ""actor"" entity to enable grouping of object roles in specific events. This context-dependent classification of attributes of an object allows for more efficient browsing and retrieval. The model also allows for decomposition of events into elementary motion units and elementary reaction/interaction units in order to access mid-level semantics and low-level video features. The instantiations of the model are expressed as graphs. Users can formulate flexible queries that can be translated into such graphs. Alternatively, users can input query graphs by editing an abstract model (model template). Search and retrieval is accomplished by matching the query graph with those instantiated models in the database. Examples and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated modeling and querying framework.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2004.837238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1359864","65;Events;integrated video model;model-based query formation;object motion description;query resolution by graph matching;video objects","Color;Communities;Computer vision;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Object oriented modeling;Object recognition;Shape;Spatial databases;Video on demand","SQL;content-based retrieval;entity-relationship modelling;graph theory;multimedia computing;object-oriented databases;query formulation;video databases","abstract model;computer vision;context-dependent classification;entity-relation model;graph matching;information retrieval;integrated semantic-syntactic video modeling;model-based query formation;multimedia document;object motion description;object-based structural video model;object-oriented model;query graph;query resolution;video browsing;video processing;video search","","16","2","44","","","Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a result, how to capture information in HTML tables semantically and integrate relevant information is a challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach that automatically captures the semantic hierarchies of HTML tables, and semi-automatically integrates HTML tables. It first automatically captures the attribute-value pairs in HTML tables by normalization, and introduces the notion of eigenvalue in formatting information to recognize the headings of HTML tables. After generating the global concepts and global schema manually by defining what data to be integrated, it then learns the lexical semantic set for each global concept, the contexts via labelling the attributes of example HTML tables to their corresponding global concept. Finally, it integrates the data of each source HTML table using the lexical semantic sets and the contexts to eliminate the conflicts and solve the nondeterministic problems in mapping each source schema to the global schema.","","POD:0-7695-2216-5","10.1109/CIT.2004.1357214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357214","","Application software;Computer science;Data mining;Databases;Drives;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;HTML;Information retrieval;Labeling;Software engineering","data structures;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;hypermedia markup languages;knowledge acquisition;merging","HTML tables;attribute-value pairs;data integration;information extraction;information formatting;information integration;lexical semantic set;nondeterministic problems;semantic hierarchy;semiautomatic integration","","3","","12","","","14-16 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some novel methods such as N/W, CIBR, LIRR etc, were proposed directly from the simplified near infrared (NIR) radiative transfer equations [Kaufman and Gao, 1992]. By using NIR ""water vapor"" channel (940 nm) in addition to ""window"" channels (865 nm and 1240 nm), two-band method and three-band method were applied to derive PWV using MODIS NIR data [Gao and Kaufman, 1998]. PWV retrieval method, with MODIS NIR band is analyzed using radiative transfer code, MODTRAN. The effect of surface nonlinear reflectivity on PWV retrieval is highlighted. Both two-band ratio method and three-band ratio method are taken into account. In a sensitivity analysis it is shown that the error due to the surface nonlinear reflectivity is very large (from 0.36 g/cm<sup>2</sup> to 2.22 g/cm<sup>2</sup> when PWV is from 0.2 g/cm<sup>2</sup> to 6.2 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>) if the reflectance ratio between ""water vapor"" band (940 nm band) and ""windows"" band (865 nm band) is not equal to unit. The error is proportional (about 14.7 times) to the transmittance (tau<sub>90 </sub> and tau<sub>865</sub>) ratio between these two bands. With Johns Hopkins University spectral library [2000], the ratio of band reflectance is calculated for hundreds kinds of surface material such as rocks, minerals, soils, vegetation and water. Most of the reflectance ratios have a considerable difference from unit. The absolute value of mean difference ranges from 0.0005 to 0.4351 for two bands method. It is from 0.0002 to 0.3089 for three bands method and smaller than two bands obviously. That indicates three-band method is superior to two-band method. To minimize the bands ratio for three bands method, the original band coefficients (0.2 and 0.8) estimated from the band position (940 nm, 865 nm and 1240 nm) are recalculated from the spectral library using least square method. The result shows that C<sub>1</su- b> = 0.8477, C<sub>2</sub> = 1, C<sub>1</sub> = 0.1523 and these coefficients must be obtained from the regression of whole spectral library and the sum of these two coefficients must be equal to unit","","POD:0-7803-8742-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1370036","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1370036","","Electromagnetic wave absorption;Equations;Information retrieval;Libraries;MODIS;Minerals;Reflectivity;Remote sensing;Sensitivity analysis;Soil","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric optics;atmospheric precipitation;atmospheric techniques;radiative transfer;reflectivity;remote sensing","1240 nm;865 nm;940 nm;CIBR;Johns Hopkins University spectral library;LIRR;MODIS NIR band;MODIS NIR data;MODTRAN;N/W;absorption techniques;band reflectance ratio;near infrared radiative transfer equations;precipitable water vapor;radiative transfer code;ratio method;remote sensing;sensitivity analysis;surface nonlinear reflectivity;surface reflectivity;water vapor channel;water vapor retrieval","","0","","9","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
