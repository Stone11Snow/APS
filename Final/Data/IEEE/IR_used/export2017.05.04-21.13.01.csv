Standardized protocols, such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI are used to discover and invoke remotely located services. Nowadays, improved resource capabilities of mobile devices, e.g. PDAs, smart phones, and sensor devices allow the execution of services even on these smaller computing devices. In comparison to traditional centralized process management, a decentralized, cooperative execution of services on embedded real-time systems leads to higher system scalability, better system response time and higher data accuracy. In this paper we describe an efficient way to deploy services onto highly distributed, mobile, and unreliable devices. To achieve an efficient resource tracking we utilize different group-based data retrieval strategies. Furthermore, we present a prototype system that implements our distributed service deployment algorithm and that evaluates our approach in terms of scalability for different network topologies.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1025-5; POD:978-1-4244-1024-8","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451002","","Ad hoc networks;Delay;Information retrieval;Intelligent sensors;Personal digital assistants;Prototypes;Real time systems;Scalability;Simple object access protocol;Smart phones","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network topology","SOAP;UDDI;WSDL;distributed service deployment algorithm;group-based data retrieval strategy;mobile ad-hoc network;network topology;resource tracking","","0","","22","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DPA attack is a powerful side-channel attack. During a DPA attack, the attacker uses power consumption measurements from the secure IC and statistical techniques to correlate the power consumption information leaked with the secret key stored in the secure IC, thus retrieving the secret key, and effectively breaking the secure IC. In this paper, we present a Reduced Complementary Dynamic and Differential Logic (RCDDL) style to design DPA-resistant, secure ICs. RCDDL style ensures that the power consumption of the secure IC remains invariant, and hence, uncorrelated to the input data (secret key). As opposed to existing DDL styles that complement every gate in the uncomplementary logic to generate the differential output, RCDDL style proposes reuse of gates, thus ensuring that a reduced number of gates in the uncomplementary logic are complemented to generate the differential output. Further, we present an analysis of how reduced complementation is achieved while maintaining the capacitance and switching requirements for power invariance. To evaluate the proposed logic style, we built a set of logic gates typically used to design secure ICs. Experiments on a set of circuits, designed using the set of RCDDL gates, show significant improvements in security strength, power consumption and area.","1063-9667;10639667","POD:0-7695-3083-4","10.1109/VLSI.2008.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4450579","","CMOS integrated circuits;CMOS logic circuits;Capacitance;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Information security;Logic design;Power measurement;Smart cards","CMOS logic circuits;embedded systems;integrated circuit design;logic design;logic gates;low-power electronics;private key cryptography","CMOS logic;DPA-resistant secure IC design;RCDDL gates;differential power analysis attack;embedded cryptographic IC;logic gates;power consumption measurements;reduced complementary dynamic-and-differential logic;secret key;side-channel attack","","3","1","20","","","4-8 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Another advantage of wavelet transform is that one can analyse textures with multiresolution and can classify directional texture pattern information into each directional subband.

Nevertheless, many wavelet-based image retrieval approaches are not good tool to use directional subband information, obtained by wavelet transforms, for efficiently directional texture pattern classification of retrieved images.

In this paper, we describe the Bib-1 access points semantics of the Z39.50 protocol using the RDF Schema language, based on the official semantics specification of the Z39.50 Bib-1 attribute set. Moreover, we suggest two algorithms for the substitution of unsupported access point exploiting semantics information from the RDFS graph. The algorithms produce the set of access points, the proper combination of which produces semantics similar to the original access point. Then, we optimize the resulting set of access points by producing the minimal set of them with the closest semantics to the original one.

In particular, the paper contribution is a context-aware model capable of recognizing and coordinating learner’s goals and activities in order to map these activities onto available learning services and resources. This is achieved through a structured and flexible ontology formulation of context, based on context fusion and cooperation, and driven by the learner’s goals and activities.

The structure of large networks is dynamically changing because of failures and modifications. Besides, it must support user mobility as well. The information to be handled extends beyond the traditional fixed type precise and deterministic information, approximating the ones used in natural languages. Such a system cannot be handled by the classical models. The intelligent system can be modelled as having logical, temporal and topological structures together with operations on these structures. The architecture proposed is based on the demand driven information processing model with static or dynamic task allocation over inhomogeneous or homogeneous resource types and network structures. The processing nodes may employ any mix of the four basic information processing models (control, data, demand and information driven models). Introducing a model time as a partially ordered set of events, an evolutionary system can be considered, both in its capabilities and structure.

Thus, the basic unit for search and retrieval is an individual page, even though information on a topic is often spread across multiple pages. This degrades the quality of search results, especially for long or uncorrelated (multitopic) queries (in which individual keywords rarely occur together in the same document), where a single page is unlikely to satisfy the user's information need. We propose a technique that, given a keyword query, on the fly generates new pages, called composed pages, which contain all query keywords. The composed pages are generated by extracting and stitching together relevant pieces from hyperlinked Web pages and retaining links to the original Web pages. To rank the composed pages, we consider both the hyperlink structure of the original pages and the associations between the keywords within each page. Furthermore, we present and experimentally evaluate heuristic algorithms to efficiently generate the top composed pages. The quality of our method is compared to current approaches by using user surveys. Finally, we also show how our techniques can be used to perform query-specific summarization of Web pages.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.190703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378376","Internet search;Retrieval Models;Search process;Web Search","Data mining;Degradation;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Search engines;Tree graphs;Web pages;Web search","query processing;search engines","Web pages;Web search engines;queries","","17","","40","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed feature matrix consists of values obtained through a neighborhood operation of detected corners. This result in a significant small size feature matrix compared to the algorithms using color features and thus is computationally very efficient. The corners have been extracted by finding the intersections of the detected lines found using Hough transform. As the affine transformations preserve the co-linearity of points on a line and their intersection properties, the resulting corner features for image retrieval are robust to affine transformations. Furthermore, the corner features are invariant to noise. It is considered that the proposed algorithm will produce good results in combination with other algorithms in a way of incremental verification for similarity.","2162-7843;21627843","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1835-0; POD:978-1-4244-1834-3","10.1109/ISSPIT.2007.4458071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4458071","Content based image retrieval;Image content retrieval;Image indexing;Image retrieval;Multimedia/Image databases;multimedia search","Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Shape;Signal processing algorithms;Spatial databases","Hough transforms;affine transforms;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image retrieval;matrix algebra;object detection;visual databases","Hough transform;affine transformation;content based image retrieval;corner shape based object retrieval;feature matrix;image database;object retrieval approach","","0","","28","","","15-18 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various functions in an RDBMS can be easily utilized by storing the labeled XML documents into the RDB. However, in traditional labeling methods, a number of nodes need to be relabeled, when the XML documents are updated. To address this problem, we proposed DO-VLEI code combining VLEI code with the Dewey Order method. DO-VLEI code is effective to reduce the update cost, but the label size increases rapidly when handling large XML documents. To reduce the label size, we presented Compressed-bit-string DO-VLEI (C-DO-VLEI) code. However, it is difficult to handle the length of C-DO-VLEI because it is a variable-length code. In this paper, we propose two effective methods, VLEI-ABL and VLEI-EOL for handling the code length of C-DO-VLEI. We perform experiments to compare the storage consumption of the proposed methods with the previously known ORDPATH.

Commands originate at the network operations centre and are piped over a virtual private network (VPN) through a shore station and down a marine fibre optic cable to the sub-sea components consisting of central nodes, instrument interface modules, and instrument systems. Data from the instrument sensors flows through the infrastructure and is briefly buffered at the shore station before being transmitted over the Internet to the data management and archive system (DMAS) at the University of Victoria. Here the information is sorted and stored for publication on the project web site and retrieval by observatory users. The observatory consists of 2 independent arrays located in the coastal waters of southern British Columbia. The first is in Saanich Inlet with a node at the 96 m depth near the entrance to Patricia Bay. The second array is in the Strait of Georgia, with two nodes southwest of the main mouth of the Fraser River, including a deep node at 300 m and a shallow node at 170 m.

Different from prior work, the power consumption of turning on and turning off the wireless network interfaces is considered. In addition, we also employ a server cache to reduce the effect of the time to retrieve data items from the corresponding data servers. Specifically, we first analyze the access and tuning times of data requests, and propose an adaptive index and data organizing algorithm (AIDOA) to adjust the degree of buckets according to the system workload. Several experiments are then conducted to evaluate the performance of algorithm AIDOA. The experimental results show that algorithm AIDOA is able to greatly reduce the power consumption at the cost of a slight increase in the average access time and dynamically adjust the index and data organization to adapt to the change of system workload.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2007.914739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4459770","Data indexing;energy conservation;mobile information system;on-demand data broadcasting","Algorithm design and analysis;Batteries;Broadcasting;Energy conservation;Energy consumption;Indexing;Information retrieval;Network servers;Turning;Wireless networks","broadcasting;data communication;mobile radio","AIDOA;adaptive index and data organizing algorithm;data indexing technique;energy-conserving indexing method;mobile information system;on-demand data broadcasting systems;server cache;wireless network interfaces","","9","","22","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a DRM system in which the license server can generate the content decryption key for a user to play an encrypted content object without gaining any information to link to the specific content object encrypted by the content encryption key. This is achieved by applying a (partially) blind signature primitive in the license acquisition protocol and by adopting a key scheme that a content encryption key depends on the information retrieved from the content object and a secret that only the license server knows. By requesting that the client DRM module does not send any information about a user's playing statistics and all the messages the client DRM module sends out are in plain text for easy checking by a user if the client DRM module abides by this rule, consumer privacy is fully protected in our DRM system.","2331-9852;23319852","Electronic:978-1-4244-1457-4; POD:1-4244-1457-1","10.1109/ccnc08.2007.244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446542","","Content based retrieval;Content management;Cryptography;Information retrieval;Intellectual property;Licenses;Privacy;Protection;Protocols;Statistics","cryptography;data privacy;industrial property","DRM system;blind signature;consumer privacy;content encryption key;digital rights management;intellectual property;license acquisition protocol;license server","","3","1","22","","","10-12 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two different methods of exchanging information among vehicles, i.e. distributing it proactively or requesting it on-demand. Proactive distribution of information is suitable for distributing small amounts of data, comprising information of common interest for a large number of vehicles. In contrast, proactive distribution of data is not advisable if information contained therein is relevant only to a small number of vehicles or if it would require large amounts of data. A more efficient alternative in this case is on-demand information distribution, which allows information of interest to be located, requested and sent on-demand. On-demand information retrieval in sparse metropolitan-wide VANETs is challenging, as vehicles stay in the metropolitan area only for a short period of time and message exchange is impacted by communication delays. In this paper, we introduce three different concepts of a search engine for metropolitan VANETs and explain how these concepts could make it possible to allow on-demand information exchange. We compare the concepts for their applicability by evaluating their performance with respect to latency and network load.","2166-0077;21660077","POD:978-1-4244-2024-7","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2007.4437818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4437818","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Delay effects;Information retrieval;Safety;Search engines;Search methods;Telecommunication traffic;Urban areas;Vehicles","ad hoc networks;information retrieval;mobile radio;search engines","information exchange;metropolitan vehicular ad-hoc networks;network load;ondemand information retrieval;performance evaluation;search engine;time exchange","","4","","21","","","26-30 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important concern in such networks is the communication between the sensors. This communication needs to be energy efficient and highly reliable while keeping delays low. Mobility also has to be supported as the nodes are positioned on different parts of the body that move with regard to each other. In this paper, we present a new cross-layer communication protocol for WBANs: CICADA or Cascading Information retrieval by Controlling Access with Distributed slot Assignment. The protocol sets up a network tree in a distributed manner. This tree structure is subsequently used to guarantee collision free access to the medium and to route data towards the sink. The paper analyzes CICADA and shows simulation results. The protocol offers low delay and good resilience to mobility.

A parser for the language and its formal specification were seen as an essential first step in being able to issue correct, purposeful queries to the network. A simple specification model that could be incrementally refined through to implementation was considered essential in accomplishing this goal. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is two-fold.

The global <i>T</i> <sub>B</sub> database consists of half-degree continental pixels and accounts for within-pixel heterogeneity, based on 1-km resolution land cover maps. The retrievals were performed by using a three-parameter inversion method applied to the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere model. By using a Bayesian approach, vegetation data were injected as a priori information. Two options were investigated to profit from normalized difference vegetation index products: providing an a priori knowledge either on vegetation optical depth or on the vegetation cover fraction (<i>f</i> <sub>cover</sub>). The latter option allows for a better description of the surface heterogeneity by considering a bare soil fraction. When an error of 1 K is applied to the <i>T</i> <sub>B</sub>, both synergistic schemes significantly improved the soil moisture accuracy compared with methods using microwave data only. Using the vegetation a priori information, about 80% of the pixels present soil moisture retrieval accuracy less than 0.04 m<sup>3</sup>middotm<sup>-3</sup> in terms of root-mean-square error, whereas methods based only on the microwave data provide 63% of pixels of the studied area with this accuracy. If the error in <i>T</i> <sub>B</sub> is larger (2 or 3 K), the soil moisture retrieval accuracy decreases significantly for both methods. The use of optical data to give a priori value of vegetation optical option is then the best for these cases.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.914808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4456814","Microwave radiometry;Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS);microwave remote sensing;moisture;normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI);satellite applications;surface soil moisture;synergy;vegetation","Biomedical optical imaging;Brightness temperature;Information retrieval;Microwave radiometry;Microwave theory and techniques;Optical sensors;SMOS mission;Soil moisture;Surface soil;Vegetation mapping","microwave measurement;radiometers;soil;vegetation;vegetation mapping","Bayesian approach;L-band microwave emission;SMOS microwave radiometer;Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity;bare soil fraction;biosphere;frequency 1.4 GHz;global surface soil moisture;microwave brightness temperature;normalized difference vegetation index;optical sensors;three-parameter inversion method;vegetation cover fraction","","5","","36","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the metadata standards that has been established to describe multimedia content via metadata is MPEG-7. This international standard facilitates many application domains and is probably the richest multimedia metadata set available today. However it does not yet exist a common query format that enables the user to query multimedia metadata databases. Therefore the MPEG committee decided to instantiate a call for proposal (N8220)for an MPEG-7 query format (MP7QF) framework and specified a set of requirements (N8219).

We used a model for a knowledge-rich database, which consists not only of the components from a deductive database but also the components relevant to knowledge discovery tools. The discovered rule set constitutes a graph whose edges are the rules. This condition dependency graph provides a map of possible query reformulation operations so that semantic query optimization could be performed. Semantic knowledge is needed to optimize queries.

Extracting interesting knowledge from raw data, or data mining in a broader sense, has become an indispensable task. Nevertheless, data collected from complex phenomena represent often the integrated result of several interrelated variables, whereas these variables are less precisely defined. The basic principle of data mining is to distinguish which variable is related to which and how the variables are related. In many situations, the digitized information is gathered and stored as a data matrix. It is often the case, or so assumed, that the exogenous variables depend on the endogenous variables in a linear relationship. Retrieving ""useful"" information therefore can often be characterized as finding ""suitable"" matrix factorization. This paper offers a synopsis from this prospect on how linear algebra techniques can help to carry out the task of data mining. Examples from factor analysis, cluster analysis, latent semantic indexing and link analysis are used to demonstrate how matrix factorization helps to uncover hidden connection and do things fast. Low rank matrix approximation plays a fundamental role in cleaning the data and compressing the data. Other types of constraints, such as nonnegativity, will also be briefly discussed.","","POD:978-0-7695-3128-1","10.1109/ICKS.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4460463","cluster analysis;data mining;factor analysis;linear model;link analysis;matrix factorization","Cleaning;Data analysis;Data mining;Image reconstruction;Indexing;Informatics;Information retrieval;Linear algebra;Mathematics;Technological innovation","approximation theory;data analysis;data compression;data mining;matrix decomposition","applied linear algebra;data analysis;data cleaning;data compression;data matrix factorization;data mining;information retrieval;knowledge extraction;low rank matrix approximation","","0","","13","","","17-17 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An image retrieval method combined color and texture features is proposed in this paper. According to image texture characteristic, a kind of image feature statistic is defined. By using feature weight assignment operators designed here, the method can assign weight to color and texture features according to image content adaptively and realize image retrieval based on combined image features.

TCP is the most commonly used transport control protocol. It assumes that every packet loss is caused by network congestion and invokes congestion control and avoidance. TCP's blind congestion control results in degraded performance in lossy wireless networks. In a wireless network, mobile hosts have first-hand knowledge of the lossy wireless links; therefore, mobile stations can make better transmission control based on the known status of wireless link. In this paper, we proposed a new mobile-host-centric transport protocol (MCP) that integrates the characteristics of sender-centric and receiver-centric transport control schemes. MCP shifts most control policies to the mobile host side. The general behavior of MCP is similar to the TCP, but by utilizing the local information collecting from the mobile node in WLAN, MCP allows for better congestion control and loss recovery. Specifically, we designed a cross-layer implementation of MCP and ran it on NS-2 network simulator. With valuable Medium Access Control (MAC) layer feedback information, MCP is able to distinguish packet loss caused by wireless random errors from network congestion more clearly and can perform a more accurate congestion control. We did extensive simulations of MCP on various WLAN scenarios, and the results show that the throughput of MCP with cross-layer feedback is higher than that of TCP Reno and Westwood.","0018-9499;00189499","","10.1109/TNS.2007.914319","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448534","Information rates;Traffic control;Transport protocols;Wireless LAN","Degradation;Feedback;Information retrieval;Performance loss;Physics;Propagation losses;Transport protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless networks","Tokamak devices;feedback;physical instrumentation control;telecommunication congestion control;transport protocols;wireless LAN","EAST experiment;NS-2 network simulator;TCP;WLAN;cross-layer feedback;invokes congestion control;medium access control layer feedback information;mobile-host-centric transport protocol;network congestion control;receiver-centric transport control schemes;sender-centric transport control schemes;transmission control protocol;wireless local area network;wireless random errors","","8","","14","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this we first select a super-peer based P2P network with a hierarchical structure. Then, based on this framework, we efficiently cluster and index all the melodies or peers in the P2P network by indicating the motif representing the music's melodies extracted from MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) files, as one point (.) in a twodimensional space.

Integrating the extremely dense and localized data from modern multibeam echo sounders with the much more significant area coverage of older survey data presents the fundamental challenge when creating high resolution coastal bathymetry grids. Data from nearly 7000 hydrographic surveys are being assessed to produce bathymetry grids for the coastal U.S. Every survey in the database is associated with metadata attributes summarized from the survey's descriptive report. Compiling high quality coastal bathymetry over extensive regions involves several hundred surveys whose range in age often spans over a century. Compared to survey measurements and the original hydrographic processing shortly after field collection, the greater uncertainties in representing the seafloor come from errors in the archive data retrieval processing that occurred years after field collection, as well as from the unknown depths between sparse soundings of historic surveys, whose interpolated values will constitute a substantial portion of gridded bathymetric coverage for the entire U.S. coast.","0197-7385;01977385","CD:978-0933957-35-0","10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449373","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4449373","","Area measurement;Atmospheric measurements;Databases;Information retrieval;Navigation;Oceanographic techniques;Oceans;Sea floor;Sea measurements;Spatial resolution","bathymetry;data acquisition;data assimilation;navigation;oceanographic techniques","AD 1850 to 2006;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Ocean Service;U.S. coastal waters;data set fusion;depth measurements;high resolution bathymetry grids;hydrographic survey data;metadata;multibeam echo sounders;navigational charts;seafloor representation;time 155 yr","","0","","21","","","Sept. 29 2007-Oct. 4 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We named the intended purposes for a place ""space-human activity association"". Intended purposes for a place will be different depending on the purpose of activities, even if observed activities are almost the same. Therefore, estimation of space-human activity association is important for intelligent environments to design services provided for individual human according to his/her current situation. The spatial memory system enables human users to store computerized information into the real world by assigning a three-dimensional position to the information, and to retrieve the information by directly indicating the point using their own hands. In the spatial memory system, what associates computerized information with a three-dimensional position is called ""spatial-knowledge-tag (SKT)"". The users actively create SKTs based on their need. As a result, arranged SKTs in a specified environment correspond to activity histories of the users. Also, users' intended purposes for the environment are reflected in the arrangement. Therefore, classification of arranged SKTs leads to classification of human activities, and accordingly estimation of intended purposes for places. In this paper, in order to investigate usefulness of the proposed classification method, we consider two types of environments, and arranged SKTs are classified.","1553-572X;1553572X","POD:1-4244-0783-4","10.1109/IECON.2007.4460249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4460249","","Aerospace industry;Books;Electronics industry;History;Humans;Industrial Electronics Society;Information retrieval;Intelligent actuators;Intelligent sensors;Notice of Violation","file organisation;information retrieval","intelligent space;space-human activity association;spatial memory system;spatial-knowledge-tag","","0","","13","","","5-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In remote sensing applications, the wealth of spectral information provided by last-generation (hyperspectral) instruments has quickly introduced the need for parallel CBIR systems able to effectively retrieve features of interest from ever-growing data archives. To address this need, this paper develops a new parallel CBIR system which has been specifically designed to be run on heterogeneous networks of computers (HNOCs). These platforms have soon become a standard computing architecture in remote sensing missions due to the distributed nature of data repositories. The proposed heterogeneous system first extracts an image feature vector able to characterize image content with sub-pixel precision, and then uses the obtained feature as a search reference.

To mask or hide the high churn from the short-lived but churn-frequent peers and permanent failure peers, we use replication among the nodes in a certain interval of the identifier space that can be considered as a virtual node.

Using a large amount of consumer reviews, the system allows users to input natural language queries and retrieves appropriate products even if the queries are highly subjective. To estimate the correspondence between a query and a review text, the system extracts 3-tuples consisting of a product name/category, its features, and the value from each text using rules based on syntactic patterns. It calculates each product scores based on correspondence rate of 3-tuples and presents ranked relevant products. In experimental results for a accommodation domain, it obtained higher average and total precision for 10 queries compared with a baseline that uses keyword based tf-idf method.

There are mainly three advantages for relevance measureby using our method: (1) The relevance degree can be compared more easy than other methods because the score of relevance calculation is equal to a numeral between 0 and 1;(2) By using the method, we can not only know whether there is relevance between the considered events but also get a special score that represents the relevance degree of these events; (3) When we calculate the PCE, we needn't know all the conditional probability density, so our method is more flexible than the calculation of mutual information. To demonstrate the usefulness of our method for relevance measure, we apply it to the sentence relevance analysis in Natural Language Processing(NLP).

There are two important issues related to the similarity search, namely, the design of a distance function to measure the similarity and improving the search efficiency. Many distance functions have been proposed, which attempt to closely mimic human recognition. Unfortunately, some of these well-designed distance functions do not follow the triangle inequality and are therefore nonmetric. As a consequence, efficient retrieval by using these nonmetric distance functions becomes more challenging, since most existing index structures assume that the indexed distance functions are metric. In this paper, we address this challenging problem by proposing an efficient method, that is, local constant embedding (LCE), which divides the data set into disjoint groups so that the triangle inequality holds within each group by constant shifting. Furthermore, we design a pivot selection approach for the converted metric distance and create an index structure to speed up the retrieval efficiency. Moreover, we also propose a novel method to answer approximate similarity search in the nonmetric space with a guaranteed query accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method works well on various nonmetric distance functions and improves the retrieval efficiency by an order of magnitude compared to the linear scan and existing retrieval approaches with no false dismissals.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.190700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378373","Multimedia databases;Query processing","Algorithm design and analysis;Character recognition;Data mining;Extraterrestrial measurements;Horses;Humans;Information retrieval;Jacobian matrices;Robustness;Web search","query formulation","distance function;local constant embedding;similarity-based search","","7","","39","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Experimental results show that the proposed retrieval methods can largely speed up the retrieval process.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0983-9; POD:978-1-4244-0982-2","10.1109/ICICS.2007.4449570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4449570","K nearest neighbor search;feature space;image retrieval","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Space technology;Spatial databases;Vectors","image retrieval;query processing;visual databases","codeword;enhanced equal-average equal-variance k- nearest neighbour search;feature space;image retrieval schemes;query image;vector quantised feature database","","1","","14","","","10-13 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can learn a user's preference implicitly and then generate the user profile automatically. When the user inputs query keywords, more personalized expansion words are generated by the proposed algorithm, and then these words together with the query keywords are submitted to a popular search engine such as Baidu or Google. These expansion words can help a search engine retrieval information for a user according to his/her implicit search intentions. The new Web search model can make a common search engine personalized, that is, throughout personalized query expansion the search engine can return different search results to different users who input the same keywords.

Query images may appear with different scales and rotations in different images, so a hierarchical image segmentation is proposed to partition the retrieved images into equal blocks with different sizes at different levels. Then, the similar metrics of these sub- blocks to query image, are evaluated to retrieve those sub-blocks with contents in query images. Meanwhile, information about scales and locations of query objects in retrieved images can also be returned. The hierarchical block image retrieval schemes with geometric invariants, normalized histograms and their combinations are tested by experiments via a database with 500 images, respectively. The retrieval accuracy with geometric invariants as invariant features can achieve 78% for the optimal similar metric threshold. Furthermore, the scheme can also work with different size images.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3007-9; POD:0-7695-3007-9","10.1109/SKG.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438549","","Content based retrieval;Discrete Fourier transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatial databases","image matching;image retrieval;image segmentation","geometric invariant;hierarchical block image retrieval;hierarchical image segmentation;image matching;image threshold;normalized histogram","","0","","9","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing search engines retrieve information based on keywords, so huge number of irrelevant information is retrieved for users. By the appearing of the second generation of the World Wide Web the semantic web, many suitable approaches to retrieve information that depends on semantic can be built. Semantic web provides data models and languages such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), and Web Ontology Language (WOL) that facilitate building ontology within a specific domain. Ontology can capture concepts for specific domain. In addition, it can capture properties of these concepts, and their relationships. Therefore, they help machines to deal with data domain semantically. This paper proposes a new approach to measure the relevancy of Arabic documents to the user query using ontology concepts. In this paper we built Arabic ontology concepts for the electronic commerce domain in Arabic language. Ontology concepts are used to find new approach for ranking Arabic documents, and show the effectiveness of ontology in retrieving relevant documents.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1476-5; POD:978-1-4244-1475-8","10.1109/ICDIM.2007.4444298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4444298","Arabic web sites;electronic commerce;ontology;ontology concepts;ranking;semantic web","Application software;Computer science;Data models;Electronic commerce;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Search engines;Semantic Web;Web sites","","","","1","","18","","","28-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Negotiation processes that take place in transactions are complex processes, time consuming and costly for participants in order to reach an agreement. Methods such as game theory, which makes a number of assumptions including knowledge of circumstances, are not able to deal with an open environment such as web-based systems where the information is sparse and full of uncertainty, while the fuzzy approaches are suitable to deal with this problem. In this paper based on fuzzy logic a model of negotiation agent to overcome the complexity of negotiation processes is presented. The characteristics of this model are interacting autonomously and able to negotiate with other agents based on multi-issues on behalf of the real-world parties that the agent represents. The reasoning model of the negotiation agent has been implemented within E-commerce system framework. The performance of the framework is evaluated. The proposed negotiation agent model is acceptable for negotiation parties to achieve mutual benefits.","","CD-ROM:978-1-1244-1366-9; POD:978-1-4244-1365-2","10.1109/ICCES.2007.4447027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4447027","E-Commerce;Fuzzy Logic;Intelligent Agents;Negotiation Agent","Costs;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Game theory;Informatics;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Irrigation;Power system modeling;Uncertainty","electronic commerce;fuzzy logic;multi-agent systems","Web-based system;bilateral agent negotiation;e-commerce;fuzzy logic;game theory;intelligent agent","","3","","17","","","27-29 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To develop a general retrieval scheme which is less dependent on domain-specific knowledge, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is employed as a feature extraction method. In establishing database, quantization technique is applied to quantize the DCT coefficients of each database image, such that the feature space is partitioned into a finite number of grids, each of which corresponds to a grid code (GC). On querying an image, a reduced set of candidate images which have the same GC as that of the query image is obtained at varying levels of grid granularity. In the fine matching stage, only the remaining candidates need to be computed for the detailed similarity comparison. The experimental results show that the proposed method leads to a fast retrieval with good accuracy.","","POD:978-0-7695-2994-1","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2007.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457527","","Content based retrieval;Content management;Discrete cosine transforms;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information management;Information retrieval;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;discrete cosine transforms;feature extraction;image coding;image retrieval;indexing","DCT;content-based image retrieval;discrete cosine transform;domain-specific knowledge;feature extraction method;grid code;grid granularity;hierarchical grid-based indexing method;quantization technique","","0","","5","","","26-28 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, such good system-oriented measures suffer from some shortcomings when partial relevance judgment is used. In this paper, we discuss how to rank retrieval systems in the condition of partial relevance judgment, which is common in major retrieval evaluation events such as TREC conferences and NTCIR workshops. Four system-oriented measures, which are mean average precision, recall level precision, normalized discount cumulative gain, and normalized average precision over all documents, are discussed. Our investigation shows that averaging values over a set of queries may not be the most reliable approach to rank a group of retrieval systems. Some alternatives such as Bar da count. Condorcet voting, and the zero-one normalization method, are investigated. Experimental results are also presented for the evaluation of these methods.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1476-5; POD:978-1-4244-1475-8","10.1109/ICDIM.2007.4444193","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4444193","","Error analysis;Gain measurement;Humans;Information retrieval;Mathematics;Stability;System testing;Voting;Web search","information retrieval system evaluation;relevance feedback","Borda count;Condorcet voting;information retrieval system ranking;mean average precision;partial relevance judgment;recall level precision;system-oriented measures;zero-one normalization method","","0","","20","","","28-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new formulation is based on maximizing the mutual information that a sample labeling provides about the retrieval/classification model. This methodology is related to and extends the Query-by-Committee approach (QBC) (Seung et al., 1992) by exploiting unlabeled data in novel ways, beyond their common use only as potential query points. Unlike QBC, this method allows us to employ unlabeled data in addition to labeled data in order to select more appropriate samples for labeling. The samples thus chosen are both informative and also relevant according to a distribution of interest. This flexibility allows us to also tailor the model to arbitrary distributions relevant to the task at hand, in particular to the distribution of the test data. This formulation has implications in scenarios where the training and test distributions are different, or when a general model is adapted to a more specific model. Experiments were conducted to evaluate retrieval performance of natural-language text associated to various concepts of interest in the medical domain. We demonstrate the advantages of our formulation compared with QBC, the state-of-the art active learning approach, and against random sample selection.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457284","","Application software;Art;Computer science;Information retrieval;Labeling;Machine learning;Mutual information;State feedback;Testing;Uncertainty","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;text analysis","Query-by-Committee approach;active learning formulation;classification model;free text;medical concept learning;medical concepts;mutual information;natural-language text retrieval performance;query points;retrieval model;semisupervised active learning;test data distribution;unlabeled data;unstructured text","","3","","23","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently DB-IR integration issue has been budded in the research field. The great divide between DB and IR has caused different manners in index maintenance for newly arriving documents. While DB has extended its SQL layer to cope with text fields due to lack of intact mechanism to build IR-like index, IR usually treats a block of new documents as a logical unit of index maintenance since it has no concept of integrity constraint. However, towards DB-IR integration, a transaction on adding or updating a document should include maintenance of the postings lists accompanied by the document - hence per-document basis transactional index maintenance. In this paper, performance of a few strategies for per-document basis transaction for inserting documents -- direct index update, stand-alone auxiliary index and pulsing auxiliary index - will be evaluated. The result tested on the KRISTAL-IRMS shows that the pulsing auxiliary strategy, where long postings lists in the auxiliary index are in-place updated to the main index whereas short lists are directly updated in the auxiliary index, can be a challenging candidate for text field indexing in DB-IR integration.","","POD:978-0-7695-2930-1","10.1109/ALPIT.2007.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4460683","DB-IR integrationdynamic index maintenancestand-alone auxiliary indexpulsing auxiliary index","Conference management;Crawlers;Databases;Information retrieval;Information technology;Management information systems;Middleware;Search engines;Web search;XML","","","","1","","33","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
