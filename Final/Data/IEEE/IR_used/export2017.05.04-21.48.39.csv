Composite kernel method is one topic of interest among them. It first selects a bunch of initial kernels, each of which is determined separately by a certain type of features. Then a classifier is trained based on a linear combination of these kernels. In this paper, we propose an effective way to optimize the linear combination of kernels. We proved that this problem is equivalent to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. And the weight vector of the kernels is the eigenvector associated with the largest eigen-value. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is then trained based on this optimized combination of kernels.

Berlin, Germany","IEEE Visualization 2004","20050228","2004","","","345","352","Datasets of tens of gigabytes are becoming common in computational and experimental science. This development is driven by advances in imaging technology, producing detectors with growing resolutions, as well as availability of cheap processing power and memory capacity in commodity-based computing clusters. We describe the design of a visualization system that allows scientists to interactively explore large remote data sets in an efficient and flexible way. The system is broadly applicable and currently used by medical scientists conducting an osteoporosis research project. Human vertebral bodies are scanned using a high resolution microCT scanner producing scans of roughly 8 GB size each. All participating research groups require access to the centrally stored data. Due to the rich internal bone structure, scientists need to interactively explore the full dataset at coarse levels, as well as visualize subvolumes of interest at the highest resolution. Our solution is based on HDF5 and GridFTP. When accessing data remotely, the HDF5 data processing pipeline is modified to support efficient retrieval of subvolumes. We reduce the overall latency and optimize throughput by executing high-level operations on the remote side. The GridFTP protocol is used to pass the HDF5 requests to a customized server. The approach takes full advantage of local graphics hardware for rendering. Interactive visualization is accomplished using a background thread to access the datasets stored in a multiresolution format. A hierarchical volume tenderer provides seamless integration of high resolution details with low resolution overviews.","","POD:0-7803-8788-0","10.1109/VISUAL.2004.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1372216","","Biomedical imaging;Bones;Data processing;Data visualization;Detectors;Humans;Image resolution;Information retrieval;Osteoporosis;Pipelines","computerised tomography;data visualisation;grid computing;image resolution;medical image processing","GridFTP protocol;data processing pipeline;hierarchical volume tenderer;human vertebral body;image resolution;imaging technology;interactive visualization;remote microCT scans","","9","","38","","","10-15 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this design, each end host caches an initial portion of the video content before playback. It then keeps the video that has been played out for a certain time before discarding it. An end host maintains a list of patching parents, and retrieves lost data from one of its patching parents. Any end host that has the requested video content can be a patching parent. Several parent selection algorithms are proposed and evaluated in this paper. This architecture relieves server load by completely shifting video patching responsibility to the client side. Video content is replicated in multiple locations across the overlay network to provide fast and timely data recovery. Cooperative patching is especially advantageous for legacy video systems, since it does not require modification of the video server.

This suggests that new approaches based on database techniques might be useful in speech recognition and speech indexing. This paper presents a first step in such a direction. The algorithm developed relies on an indexed single-speaker database. The database consists of spoken utterances transcribed into text. The waveforms of these utterances are converted off-line to binary symbols called fingerprints through a nonlinear frequency-domain transform. The fingerprints are associated with the transcribed text. Given the fingerprint of a new waveform, the best word match from the database can be retrieved. A 3255 word database is used as a test bed. All the words from this database are mixed with white noise and time-scale modified to provide test data. The database is queried with the fingerprint of the test words and the best match is retrieved. The results of the experiments conducted are promising, showing a 99.5% recognition rate for a 20 dB signal to noise ratio (SNR).","","POD:0-7803-8622-1","10.1109/ACSSC.2004.1399475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1399475","","Databases;Fingerprint recognition;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Image storage;Indexing;Information retrieval;Signal to noise ratio;Speech recognition;Testing","audio databases;noise;speaker recognition;speech processing","20 dB;audio retrieval algorithm;computational capacity;database techniques;isolated word;nonlinear frequency-domain transform;presence noise;signal to noise ratio;speaker dependent recognition;speech indexing;speech recognition","","0","","5","","","7-10 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenge of this task lies in an accurate extraction of signal characteristics so as to derive a strong discriminatory feature suitable for classification. In this paper, a time-frequency (TF) approach for audio classification is proposed. Audio signals are nonstationary in nature and TF approach is the best way to analyze them. The audio signals were decomposed using an adaptive TF decomposition algorithm, and the signal decomposition parameter based on octave (scaling) was used to generate a set of 42 features over three frequency bands within the auditory range. These features were analyzed using linear discriminant functions and classified into six music groups (rock, classical, country, jazz, folk and pop).

After a critical review of most approaches seeking to solve this problem, we propose a unified detection model (both for abrupt and all types of gradual transitions), as well as an implementation whose results improve upon those of all the inspected reports. The innovation of the approach presented here is centered on mapping the space of inter-frame distances onto a new space of decision better suited to achieving a sequence-independent thresholding. This mapping aims to consider frame ordering information within the thresholding process; it is based on the parametric modeling of the patterns that transitions generate on the distances' output. As opposed to most reviewed works, our results are detailed over a large and representative sample of more than 1500 cuts and 250 gradual transitions, which make up a significant part (200 min) of the MPEG-7 testing material; this ensures a high degree of confidence in the validity of our approach.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2004.840598","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407902","Cut detection;detection model;gradual transition detection;shot transition detection;video analysis","Cameras;Gunshot detection systems;Image processing;Indexing;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Materials testing;Parametric statistics;Shape;Technological innovation","content-based retrieval;database indexing;feature extraction;image segmentation;multimedia systems;video cameras;video coding;video databases","cut detection;frame ordering information;gradual transition detection;pattern parametric model;temporal segmentation;thresholding process;unified detection model;video analysis;video indexing;video-shot transition detection;visual data retrieval","","35","2","38","","","April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While structured P2P networks (e.g. distributed hash tables, DHTs) define rules about how to proceed after this point, unstructured P2P networks continue using bootstrapping techniques until they are sufficiently connected. In this paper, we compare solutions applicable to the bootstrapping problem. Measurements of an existing system, the Gnutella web caches, highlight the inefficiency of this particular approach. Improved bootstrapping mechanisms could also incorporate locality-awareness into the process.

The result is a significant increase in image search and retrieval speed. The convex hull is first determined using a novel and efficient approach based on the geometrical heat differential equation. Next, the convex hull is represented by a triad of boundary shapes and other parameters as viewed from three viewpoints. This information enables the regions in the image database to be divided into 344 convex hull classes. Concavity information, obtained using a boundary support parameterization, further partitions the database. Since a given query must now be compared only to shapes of the same class, searching is much faster. Both theoretical background and practical results are discussed.","","POD:0-7803-8388-5","10.1109/ISBI.2004.1398658","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1398658","","Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Differential equations;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Shape;X-ray imaging","PACS;diagnostic radiography;differential equations;image retrieval","boundary support parameterization;concavity features;convex hull;fast medical image retrieval;geometrical heat differential equation;image database;image search;search space partitioning","","4","","20","","","15-18 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper looks at (i) what representation to use for documents and which extra information hidden in HTML pages to take into consideration to improve the classification task, and (ii) how to deal with the very high number of features of texts. A hypertext dataset and four well-known learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machines and C4.5) were used to exploit the enriched text representation along with feature reduction.

An effective strategy is to group computations on the same data so that once the data are loaded into cache, the program performs all their operations before the data are evicted. However, computation regrouping is difficult to automate for programs with complex data and control structures. This paper studies the potential of locality improvement through trace-driven computation regrouping. First, it shows that maximizing the locality is different from maximizing the parallelism or maximizing the cache utilization. The problem is NP-hard even without considering data dependences and cache organization. Then the paper describes a tool that performs constrained computation regrouping on program traces. The new tool is unique because it measures the exact control dependences and applies complete memory renaming and re-allocation. Using the tool, the paper measures the potential locality improvement in a set of commonly used benchmark programs written in C.","","POD:0-7695-2153-3","10.1109/SC.2004.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392943","","Automatic control;Computational modeling;Computer science;Data structures;Delay;Information retrieval;Parallel processing;Physics computing","","","","0","","44","","","06-12 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to earlier approaches, where data is typically pre-indexed for efficient retrieval according to a fixed scheme, SnapFind provides users with the flexibility to search non-indexed data in a brute force manner. The query is translated into a customized searchlet that is executed in parallel by processors near the storage devices. This enables the majority of irrelevant images to be discarded where they are stored. Partial results are displayed during search execution allowing users to interactively refine the query without waiting for search termination.

Further, combination of features makes image retrieval more relevant and robust. This paper proposes efficient methods for compactly representing color and texture features and combining them for image retrieval. The proposed methods use MPEG-7 visual descriptors namely, scalable color descriptor (SCD) for color and, homogeneous texture descriptor (HTD) for texture representation respectively. This paper investigates how compactly a descriptor could be defined and yet be used as a metric for image retrieval. If the descriptor is compact and yet performs meaningful image retrieval, then it is computationally efficient. Image classification, clustering and hierarchical modeling of image databases will benefit with such a representation.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid context model based on multilevel situation theory and ontology. Multilevel situation theory is based on an intermediate level micro situation that is used to create entity specific situations. Such micro situations are used to enhance a situation so as to enable consistent contextual reasoning. The context model is hybrid in the sense that the proposed multilevel situation theory is defined based on the entities, entity attributes, and entity relationships as described in the contact center ontology.

The major difficulty lies in the gap between low-level image features and high-level image semantics. To address the problem, this study reports a framework for effective image retrieval by employing a novel idea of memory learning. It forms a knowledge memory model to store the semantic information by simply accumulating user-provided interactions. A learning strategy is then applied to predict the semantic relationships among images according to the memorized knowledge. Image queries are finally performed based on a seamless combination of low-level features and learned semantics.

Depending on the application requirements, there exist several variations of the problem. For instance, B may be a point data set, and the goal may be to retrieve the regions of A that contain the maximum number of points. The processing of such queries with conventional spatial join algorithms is expensive. However, several improvements are possible based on the fact that we only require a small subset of the result (instead of all intersection/containments pairs). In this paper, we propose output-sensitive algorithms for top-k spatial joins that utilize a variety of optimizations for reducing the overhead.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1401894","Index Terms- Database;spatial database;spatial joins.","Aggregates;Circuits;Cost function;Information retrieval;Interference;Monitoring;Multidimensional systems;Spatial databases;Telecommunication traffic;Wires","query processing;visual databases","output-sensitive algorithm;query processing;spatial database;spatial join","","11","","35","","","April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although past literatures have suggested that the use of features from irrelevant categories can improve the measure of text categorization, we believe that by incorporating only relevant feature can be highly effective. The experimental comparison is carried out between CTD and five well-known feature selection measures: Information Gain, Chi-Square, Correlation Coefficient, Odd Ratio and GSS Coefficient. The results also show that our proposed method can perform comparatively well with other FS measures, especially on collection with highly overlapped topics.","","POD:0-7695-2100-2","10.1109/WI.2004.10060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410876","","Computer science;Dictionaries;Frequency;Gain measurement;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Natural languages;Performance evaluation;Text categorization","","","","7","","12","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the traditional case where the input coordinates appear in a raster-based fashion, the required pixel values can be obtained from the previous calculation, the frame buffer and a single line cache. This paper presents a novel approach to performing real-time bilinear interpolation that is useful in applications such as lens distortion correction where the input coordinates follow a curved path that spans multiple rows. To help retrieve the required pixels in a single clock cycle under imposed data bandwidth constraints a unique caching system has been devised. In the event that constraints make it impossible to obtain the four required pixel values, the approach performs a modified three-point interpolation. An example field programmable gate array implementation of the bilinear interpolation method used in conjunction with a lens distortion correction algorithm has been successfully completed.","","POD:0-7695-2081-2","10.1109/DELTA.2004.10055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1409828","","Clocks;Displays;Equations;Image processing;Image quality;Information retrieval;Interpolation;Lenses;Pixel;Predistortion","bandwidth allocation;cache storage;field programmable gate arrays;image processing;interpolation","caching system;data bandwidth constraints;digital rotation;digital zooming;field programmable gate array implementation;frame buffer;image quality improvement;input coordinates;lens distortion correction algorithm;pixel values;raster based fashion;real time bilinear interpolation;spatial transformation operations","","36","1","5","","","28-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional file access interfaces rely on ubiquitous transports that impose severe restrictions on performance and prove insufficient for adaptation to parallel input/output (I/O). Remote direct memory access based (RDMA-based) approaches are aimed at moving data between different process address spaces with streamlined mediation and reduced involvement of the operating system using synchronization semantics that are different from ubiquitous transports. While currently available RDMA-based file systems are not designed for parallel I/O, very few parallel file systems that are available today, benefit from the capabilities of RDMA completely. This paper analyzes the adaptability of RDMA-based transports to parallel I/O, by using a commercial grade implementation of MPI, coupled with a complete, stable DAFS implementation. Combining RDMA semantics with parallel I/O that provide overlapping communication and computation and bandwidth enhancement leads to overhead reduction, allowing more CPU usage by applications. This paper also shows that significant parallel I/O performance can be achieved by intelligent middleware, without any specific requirement on the filesystem.","1531-2216;15312216","POD:0-7803-8783-X","10.1109/ICON.2004.1409089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1409089","","Bandwidth;Computational modeling;Concurrent computing;File systems;High performance computing;Information retrieval;Mediation;Operating systems;Pervasive computing;Space technology","file organisation;middleware;parallel memories;parallel processing;synchronisation","CPU;RDMA-based file system;bandwidth enhancement;intelligent middleware;operating system;parallel file system;parallel input-output;remote direct memory access;synchronization;ubiquitous transport","","0","","24","","","16-19 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on","20050404","2004","","","124","130","Machine learning is the science of building predictors from data while accounting for the predictor's accuracy on future data. Many machine learning classifiers can make accurate predictions when the data is complete. In the presence of insufficient data, statistical methods can be applied to fill in a few missing items. But these methods rely only on the available data to calculate the missing values and perform poorly if the percentage of missing values exceeds a threshold. An alternative is to fill in the missing data by an automated knowledge discovery process via mining the WWW. This novel procedure is applied by first restoring missing information and next learning the parameters of the classifier from the restored data. Using a Bayesian network as a classifier, the parameters, i.e., the probabilities associated with the causal relationships in the network, are deduced using the knowledge mined from the WWW in conjunction with the data available on hand. The method, when tested with heart disease data sets from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository [UCI repository of machine learning databases], gave satisfactory results.","","POD:0-7695-2100-2","10.1109/WI.2004.10114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410793","","Bayesian methods;Cardiac disease;Computer science;Data mining;Information retrieval;Knowledge acquisition;Machine learning;Niobium;Training data;World Wide Web","","","","0","","18","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dense MANETs can take advantage of high node population to replicate resources of common interest to increase their availability overcoming unpredictable node movements. The paper proposes a lightweight application-level middleware, called REDMAN, to manage, retrieve and disseminate replicas of data and service components transparently from the point of view of service developers, thus facilitating the realization of scalable distributed applications for dense MANETs.

In the macroscopic analysis step, a systematic web page structure analysis is performed to locate the content cohesive text region and potential relevant header or header like tags. In the microscopic extraction step, an English parser is used to extract the relevant sentence fragments in the text region and the nearest heading text is encompassed if the need arises.

Our goal is to efficiently retrieve the distributed sensor measurements at a central processor or to share the information among all sensors. To achieve this goal with a minimum number of channel accesses, it naturally involves the compression of the distributed source data and an optimal scheduling of the transmissions to reduce the number of redundant transmissions. In this paper, we utilize a content-based group testing approach to derive a joint source coding and multiple access scheduling method without the initial knowledge of the statistics of the sensor field. The group testing multiple access (GTMA) scheme proposed in this paper is obtained by choosing groups through a tree splitting algorithm that adapts the branching of the tree according to the progressively estimated statistics of the sensor field. We show that this method overcomes the difficulty of applying the algebraic distributed source coding schemes to a large number of sensors and for arbitrary or unknown statistics of the sensor field.","","POD:0-7803-8622-1","10.1109/ACSSC.2004.1399362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1399362","","Central Processing Unit;Information retrieval;Optimal scheduling;Routing;Source coding;Statistical analysis;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Temperature sensors;Testing","algebraic codes;distributed sensors;scheduling;source coding;statistical analysis","algebraic distributed source coding scheme;content-based group testing approach;distributed sensor;group testing multiple access scheme;multiple access scheduling method;scheduling;sensor network;tree splitting algorithm","","2","","13","","","7-10 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The former network is intended to extend the search for a user's query through its periphery based upon the associations of words in their work domain ontology. The latter is leveraged to present the users with other possible keywords for their next queries, which might help their exploration advance to what they want.

The purpose of segmentation is to identify the mediastinum and the two lung lobes in a chest CT image. The ARGs (attributed relational graphs) are chosen to describe the features of segmented objects. Then, image database is constructed by the feature vectors of images. In database searching, two searching modes are provided that are ""query by example"" and ""query by object"". Our system uses Euclidean distance to measure the similarity between the image in query and the image in database. The system output the 30 most similar images in the chest CT image database as query results. The experimental results show that the average precision of our system is about 80% which is impressive in a totally automatic medical image retrieval system. Moreover, query concentrated in certain objects features usually show better result than the regular query by example.

Approaches using other attributes, such as file names or ownership information, have also demonstrated merit. At the same time, existing algorithms commonly deem all attributes of the software artifacts being clustered as equally important, a rather simplistic assumption. Moreover, no method that can assess the usefulness of a particular attribute for clustering purposes has been presented in the literature. In this paper, we present an approach that applies information theoretic techniques in the context of software clustering. Our approach allows for weighting schemes that reflect the importance of various attributes to be applied. We introduce LIMBO, a scalable hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the minimization of information loss when clustering a software system. We also present a method that can assess the usefulness of any nonstructural attribute in a software clustering context. We applied LIMBO to three large software systems in a number of experiments. The results indicate that this approach produces clusterings that come close to decompositions prepared by system experts. Experimental results were also used to validate our usefulness assessment method. Finally, we experimented with well-established weighting schemes from information retrieval, Web search, and data clustering.

We then examine the semantic content of these pages to construct a concept graph, which is used to learn the dominant content and link structure leading to target pages using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

Such networks present a constrained communication environment due to fundamental limitations of battery power and wireless bandwidth, and users' frequent mobility. These characteristics of MP2P networks make scalable data retrieval a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called proximity regions for caching in cooperative MP2P networks (PReCinCt), to efficiently support scalable data retrieval in large-scale MP2P networks. In the PReCinCt scheme, the network topology is divided into geographical regions where each region is responsible for a set of keys representing the data. Each key is then mapped to a region location based on a geographical hash function. A geographic-aided routing protocol is used to route traffic of each data retrieved. In order to further save bandwidth for each data retrieved, PReCinCt incorporates a cooperative caching scheme that caches relevant data among a set of peers in a region. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in average latency and energy consumption.","","POD:0-7695-2300-5","10.1109/PERCOMW.2005.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392799","","Bandwidth;Batteries;Energy efficiency;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Mobile communication;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic","cache storage;file organisation;information retrieval;mobile communication;peer-to-peer computing;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","PReCinCt;battery power;energy efficient data caching;energy efficient data retrieval;geographic-aided routing protocol;geographical hash function;information sharing;mobile devices;mobile peer-to-peer networks;network topology;proximity regions for Caching in cooperative MP2P networks;short-range wireless transmissions;traffic routing;wireless bandwidth","","6","","8","","","8-12 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed procedure, the feature extraction step consists of estimating the covariations (lower-order cross-correlations) between the wavelet subband coefficients, which are modeled as subGaussian random vectors. The similarity measurement is carried out first by employing norms calculating the distance between the covariation matrices representing two distinct images and second by evaluating the Kullback-Leibler Distance (KLD) between their corresponding subGaussian distributions. We provide analytical expressions relating the subGaussian features corresponding to a rotated image from the features of the original image. Finally, we relate the employed optimal lower-order correlation (p≤2) to the degree of nonGaussianity of the wavelet coefficients, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using real texture images.","","POD:0-7803-8622-1","10.1109/ACSSC.2004.1399161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1399161","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Iron;Samarium;Spatial databases;Wavelet transforms","Gaussian distribution;correlation theory;covariance matrices;feature extraction;image classification;image retrieval;image texture;realistic images;wavelet transforms","KLD;Kullback-Leibler distance;analytical expression;classification technique;covariation matrices estimation;image retrieval;invariant feature extraction;optimal lower-order correlation;random vector;real texture image;similarity measurement;steerable wavelet transform;subGaussian rotation;wavelet subband coefficient","","0","","8","","","7-10 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we novelly introduce SLR (Simple Linear Regression) model [5,7] to solve this problem. We extend 1-dimensional R^2 to ER^2 for multi-dimensional sequence matching, such as on-line handwritten signature. In addition, we develop SLR+FFT pruning techniques based on SLR to speed up retrieval without incurring any false dismissal. Experimental results show that the pruning ratio of SLR+FFT is efficient (can be above 99%). Experiments on real stocks discovered many interesting patterns. Preliminary test on on-line signature recognition using ER^2 as similarity measure also shows high accuracy.","","POD:0-7695-2100-2","10.1109/WI.2004.10140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410787","","Biometrics;Biosensors;Databases;Erbium;Information retrieval;Linear regression;Pattern matching;Testing;Time measurement;Venus","","","","0","","9","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed system, boundaries between segmented regions are deleted to improve the robustness of region-based image retrieval against uncertainty of segmentation. Second, region feature vector is hierarchically represented by information in all wavelet subbands and each feature component of a feature vector is a combined color-texture feature. Such feature vector captures the distinctive feature (e.g., semantic texture) inside one region finely.

BTH pollution is caused by the presence of a large number of noncooperating BTH devices within the same radio coverage area, which beyond introducing radio interference, also affect each other's basic BTH operations such as discovery, paging and connection setup. The overall result can be a significant slow-down in BTH networking operations, e.g. ad-hoc network formation and healing. We believe the effect of BTH pollution is largely ignored in the BTH ad-hoc networking literature.

Our goal is to adapt online the learning procedure in accordance with a user's response without the need to repeat the training procedure. Toward this end we develop a relevance feedback approach based on the concept of incremental learning recently developed in the theory of support vector machines. The proposed approach is demonstrated using clustered microcalcifications extracted from a database consisting of 76 mammograms.","","POD:0-7803-8388-5","10.1109/ISBI.2004.1398750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1398750","","Biomedical engineering;Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Support vector machines","image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical image processing;relevance feedback;support vector machines","clustered microcalcification;incremental learning;mammogram image retrieval;relevance feedback approach;support vector machine","","0","","9","","","15-18 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Question answering on the semantic Web","D. L. McGuinness","Knowledge Syst. Lab., Stanford Univ., CA, USA","IEEE Intelligent Systems","20050404","2004","19","1","82","85","Question answering on the Web is moving beyond the stage where users simply type a query and retrieve a ranked ordering of appropriate Web pages. Users and analysts want targeted answers to their questions without extraneous information. These answers might contain information from current and authoritative sources, terms with the same meaning as those used in the query, relevant links such as justifications, follow-up questions fitting the context, and provenance information. Next-generation question-answering systems might also provide better querying support. This could include identifying whether questions are incoherent and therefore can't be answered, too general and would retrieve too many answers, or over constrained and would retrieve few if any answers. We present a spectrum of techniques for improving question answering and discuss their potential uses and impact.","1541-1672;15411672","","10.1109/MIS.2004.1265890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265890","","Consumer electronics;Content based retrieval;Information retrieval;Knowledge representation;Logic;Medical information systems;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Web pages;Web services","XML;query formulation;semantic Web","information retrieval;query processing;question answering system;semantic Web","","16","1","16","","","Jan-Feb 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
