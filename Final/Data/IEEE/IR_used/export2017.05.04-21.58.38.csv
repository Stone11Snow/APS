Values in each vector are discretely parameterized along each of the three principal axes of inertia of the model.

We select the edge direction histogram and Gabor texture as the discriminative features to realize the image semantic extraction. Experiments have been done by using the standard two-class SVM and one-class SVM and the results obtained are presented. By comparing the experimental results, we conclude that the two-class SVM yields better performance than the one-class SVM. However, the benefit of using one-class SVM is due to its time saving in training.

"Adaptive location management strategy combining distance-based update and sectional paging techniques","T. Tung; A. Jamalipour","Sch. of Electr. & Inf. Eng., Sydney Univ., NSW, Australia","36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2003. Proceedings of the","20030206","2003","","","9 pp.","","In this paper, we develop a new adaptive scheme in which an optimal distance-based update threshold is selected not only as a function of the call-to-mobility ratio, but also as a transitional directivity index ω; a new parameter introduced to give some measures of the mobile's travelling patterns. It is assumed that when ω > 1, the mobile has a greater tendency of roaming ""outwards"" and hence a higher probability of transition to the next ring during each movement. As a result, the defined threshold will be reached sooner incurring more update costs. A corresponding sectional paging scheme is therefore proposed to predict mobile's likelihood of residency utilizing the information given by the estimated ω. Provided that the prediction of location probability is reliable, a movement pattern with increasing directivity will justify having increased update thresholds without incurring additional paging costs. As far as the mobility characteristics are concerned, the introduction of the directivity index has successfully demonstrated its ability to make optimum decisions on a distance-based update threshold. Its advantage becomes even more significant when the theoretically determined ""ideal"" optimal threshold is not obtainable due to certain restrictions imposed by the network during times of high system loading. Simulation results reveal that the additional information made available about a roaming mobile's transitional directivity could be critical to ensure that the best available sub-optimal threshold is realizable.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174860","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174860","","Adaptive algorithm;Algorithm design and analysis;Australia;Costs;Electric variables measurement;Frequency;Information retrieval;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Personal communication networks;Roaming","cellular radio;graph theory;mobile communication;quality of service;telecommunication network management","adaptive location management;call-to-mobility ratio;distance-based update threshold;location probability;mobile travelling patterns;sectional paging;system loading;transitional directivity index","","3","","16","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without considering agent transfer, it would make little sense to mention the modeling of strong code mobility, which aims to make a migrated agent restarted exactly from the state when it was stopped before migration. From the perspective of system's architecture, this paper proposes a two-layer approach for the formal modeling of logical agent mobility (LAM) using predicate/transition (PrT) nets. We view a mobile agent system as a set of agent spaces and agents could migrate from one space to another. Each agent space is explicitly abstracted to be a component, consisting of an environmental part and an internal connector dynamically binding agents with their environment. We use a system net, agent nets, and a connector net to model the environment, agents, and the connector, respectively. In particular, agent nets are packed up as parts of tokens in system nets, so that agent transfer and location change are naturally captured by transition firing (token game) in Petri nets. Agent nets themselves are active only at specific places and disabled at all the other places in a system net. The semantics of such a two-layer LAM model is defined by transforming it into a PrT net. This facilitates the analysis of several properties about location, state, and connection. In addition, this paper also presents a case study of modeling and analyzing an information retrieval system with mobile agents.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2003.1166587","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166587","","Ad hoc networks;Computer Society;Connectors;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Mobile agents;Mobile computing;Petri nets;Software agents;Software architecture","Petri nets;ad hoc networks;mobile agents;reachability analysis;software architecture","Petri nets;ad hoc networks;agent migration;information retrieval system;logical agent mobility;logical code mobility;physical mobility;software agents;software architecture;strong code mobility;two-layer approach","","31","","39","","","Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We show that for typical network connectivity, a user's perceived page latency is mainly due to the definition and queuing of embedded object requests inside a Web page, which are related to the content structure of a Web page and the parallelism width of the browser for object fetching.

If the number of level 1 (words that directly connect to terminal fields) FA words is limited, old methods cannot determine the documents filed easily and fast, specially when there is a small number of corpus documents. This paper proposes a new method for deciding FA terms using the weight of co-occurrence words and declinable words which are related to the narrow association category with eliminating FA terms' ambiguity. Moreover, efficient FA terms are difficult to be extracted only by the information of the frequency of them. This paper proposes a new efficient method using new co-occurrence word weighting which makes precision and recall higher than the case of degree of frequency.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:0-7803-7437-1","10.1109/ICSMC.2002.1173247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1173247","","Data mining;Frequency;Humans;Information retrieval;Information science;Intelligent systems;Research and development","classification;information retrieval;natural languages;text analysis;vocabulary","association category;classification;co-occurrence words;corpus documents;declinable words;document field subject;filed association terms;information retrieval;keywords;precision;recall;word weighting","","0","1","13","","","6-9 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the","20030206","2003","","","7 pp.","","This paper asks how Internet use, citizen satisfaction with e-government and citizen trust in government are interrelated. Prior research has found that agencies stress information and service provision on the Web (one-way e-government strategy), but have generally ignore applications that would enhance citizen-government interaction (two-way e-government strategy). Based on a review of the literature, we develop hypotheses about how two facets of e-democracy - transparency and interactivity - may affect citizen trust in government. Using data obtained from the Council on Excellence in Government, we apply a two stage multiple equation model. Findings indicate that Internet use is positively associated with transparency satisfaction but negatively associated with interactivity satisfaction, and that both interactivity and transparency are positively associated with citizen trust in government. We conclude that the one-way e-transparency strategy may be insufficient, and that in the future agencies should make and effort to enhance e-interactivity.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174323","","Costs;Councils;Electronic government;Equations;Information management;Information retrieval;Internet;Stress;Technology management;Web services","Internet;government data processing;information dissemination;socio-economic effects","Council on Excellence in Government;Internet use;World Wide Web;citizen satisfaction;citizen trust;citizen-government interaction;e-interactivity;electronic government;government agencies;information provision;interactivity satisfaction;one-way e-government strategy;one-way e-transparency strategy;service provision;transparency satisfaction;two stage multiple equation model;two-way e-government strategy","","11","","19","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such information retrieval systems aim to include subjective aspects of the users, such as their sensibility, in the querying criteria. While many techniques have been proposed to model such users' aspects, little attention has been placed on analyzing the multi-interpretation of the information involved in the process. We propose a data warehouse as a support for the mining process of such information. A unique characteristic of our data warehouse lays in its ability to store multiple hierarchical descriptions of the multimedia data. Such characteristic is necessary to allow the mining of complex data, not only at different levels of abstraction, but also according to multiple interpretation of the content. The framework we propose can be generalized to support the analysis of any type of complex data that relate to subjective cognitive processes and hence whose interpretation is greatly variable.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:0-7803-7437-1","10.1109/ICSMC.2002.1176332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176332","","Airplanes;Data warehouses;Database systems;Environmental management;Filtering;Image retrieval;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;Search engines","data mining;data warehouses;information retrieval;user modelling","Kansei engineering community;data mining process;data warehouse;information retrieval;subjective content;subjective interpretation;user modeling","","1","","16","","","6-9 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe a compact representation model for two-dimensional (2D) shapes by investigating their self-similarities and constructing their shape axis trees (SA-trees). Our approach can be formulated as a variational one (or, equivalently, as MAP estimation of a Markov random field). We start with a 2D shape, its boundary contour, and two different parameterizations for the contour (one parameterization is oriented counterclockwise and the other clockwise). To measure its self-similarity, the two parameterizations are matched to derive the best set of one-to-one point-to-point correspondences along the contour. The cost functional used in the matching may vary and is determined by the adopted self-similarity criteria, e.g., cocircularity, distance variation, parallelism, and region homogeneity. The loci of middle points of the pairing contour points yield the shape axis and they can be grouped into a unique free tree structure, the SA-tree. By implicitly encoding the (local and global) shape information into an SA-tree, a variety of vision tasks, e.g., shape recognition, comparison, and retrieval, can be performed in a more robust and efficient way via various tree-based algorithms. A dynamic programming algorithm gives the optimal solution in O(N<sup>1</sup>), where N is the size of the contour.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1159948","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159948","","Clocks;Cost function;Dynamic programming;Encoding;Information retrieval;Machine vision;Markov random fields;Robustness;Shape;Tree data structures","computer vision;dynamic programming;image representation","MRF;compact representation model;computer vision;dynamic programming;self-similarity;shape axis tree;shape representation;variational matching;vision systems","","41","","39","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A double-array structure is an efficient data structure combining fast access of a matrix form with the compactness of a list form. The drawback of the double-array is that the space efficiency degrades by empty elements produced in key deletion. Morita et al. (2001) presented a key deletion method eliminating empty elements. However, the space efficiency of this method is low for high frequent deletion and deletion takes much time because the cost depends on the number of the empty elements. This paper presents a fast and compact deletion method by using the property of nodes that have no brothers. From simulation results for 100 thousand keys, the present method is about 330 times faster than Morita's method and keeps the space efficiency ratio at 100%.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:0-7803-7437-1","10.1109/ICSMC.2002.1173350","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1173350","","Costs;Data structures;Degradation;Dictionaries;Graphics;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information science;Intelligent systems","dictionaries;tree data structures;tree searching","compact deletion algorithm;dictionaries;double-array structures;key deletion method;matrix;morphological analysis;simulation;space efficiency ratio;spelling check;tree data structure;trie","","0","","9","","","6-9 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that the design of the optimal measurement that minimizes the probability of an inconclusive result can be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem. Based on this formulation, we develop a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal quantum measurement. We show that the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time by exploiting the many well-known algorithms for solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Using the general conditions for optimality, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions so that the measurement that results in an equal probability of an inconclusive result for each one of the quantum states is optimal. We refer to this measurement as the equal-probability measurement (EPM). We then show that for any state set, the prior probabilities of the states can be chosen such that the EPM is optimal. Finally, we consider state sets with strong symmetry properties and equal prior probabilities for which the EPM is optimal. We first consider geometrically uniform (GU) state sets that are defined over a group of unitary matrices and are generated by a single generating vector. We then consider compound GU state sets which are generated by a group of unitary matrices using multiple generating vectors, where the generating vectors satisfy a certain (weighted) norm constraint.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2002.807291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176618","","Collaborative work;Information processing;Information retrieval;Information theory;Instruments;Polynomials;Quantum mechanics;Subcontracting;Sufficient conditions;Time measurement","matrix algebra;optimisation;probability;programming;quantum communication;set theory","equal prior probabilities;equal-probability measurement;geometrically uniform state sets;global optimum;linearly independent pure quantum states;multiple generating vectors;necessary conditions;optimal quantum measurement;optimal quantum states;optimal unambiguous discrimination;quantum information theory;semidefinite programming;sufficient conditions;unitary matrices;weighted norm constraint","","59","","33","","","Feb. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A combined abstraction of the conceptual and presentational characteristics of multimedia applications, leading on the one hand to their conceptual structure (with classic semantics of the real-world modeled by entities, relationships, and attributes) and on the other to the presentational structure (including media type, logical structure, temporal synchronization, spatial (on the screen) ""synchronization"" and interactive behavior) is developed in this paper. Multimedia applications are construed as consisting of ""Presentational Units:"" elementary (a media object with play duration and screen position), and composite (recursive structures of PUs in the temporal, spatial, and logical dimensions). The fundamental concept introduced is that of Semantic Multimedia Abstractions (SMA): qualitative abstract descriptions of multimedia applications in terms of their conceptual and presentational properties at an adjustable level of abstraction. SMAs, which could be viewed as metadata, form an abstract space to be queried.

Both an object-relational approach and a traditional relational approach were explored and compared in terms of design, implementation issues and efficiency. Although the object-relational approach results in a simpler design, implementation is more complicated as object methods must be programmed. In the relational design, queries were more complex to express than in the object-oriented design, but more efficient to execute. It was concluded that the DR design should use standard relational tables while using objects only when required for specialized processing, such as processing of graphs or scans.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174352","","ANSI standards;Computer science;Data mining;Information retrieval;Medical services;Object oriented modeling;Relational databases;Standards development;Statistical analysis;XML","Internet;XML;data mining;document handling;medical information systems;object-oriented databases;query processing;relational databases","CDA documents;Health Level 7 Clinic Document Architecture;XML-based document markup standard;clinic document semantics;data mining;document processing;document retrieval;graph processing;hierarchical structure;information exchange;object-oriented design;object-relational approach;relational design;relational tables;statistical analysis;storage model","","2","","11","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to make the system robust for text detection in various natural scenes, the detection approach efficiently embeds multi-resolution, adaptive search in a hierarchical framework with different emphases at each layer. We also introduce an intensity-based OCR method to recognize characters in various fonts and lighting conditions, where we employ the Gabor transform to obtain local features, and LDA for selection and classification of features. The recognition rate is 92.4% for the testing set obtained from the natural sign. A sign is different from the normal used sentence. It is brief with a lot of abbreviations and place nouns. We only briefly introduce a rule-based place name translation.

In the experiments, expected loss is the best for small means, like 1 or 2, and probably approximately correct is the best for all the other cases. Also, we apply the general method to compare the performance of HITS-based algorithms that combine four relevance-scoring methods, VSM, Okapi, TLS, and CDR, using a set of broad topic queries.

In this paper three different information retrieval techniques are evaluated for the task of music information retrieval. Two of them are commonly used for text documents, while the other was designed specifically for musical content.

We discuss a simple way to describe such a dependence, which allows us to find out that the set of the retrievable harmonics for the quadratic approach contains that for the linear one.

Proceedings of the","20030206","2003","","","10 pp.","","Small ubiquitous devices connected by wireless networks will become future Internet appliances. To support them, communication networks must evolve to seamlessly assist appliances and provide advanced functionalities. We present a personal communication environment called Omnisphere that provides a communication and information universe surrounding wireless appliances. It is based on a high level concept called ambient services that allows to construct complex services out of primitive ones by connecting them with typed data flows. A typed data flow is an abstract view of communication between ambient services. It encapsulates three elements: channels, control, and metadata. Omnisphere provides a predefined service for discovery of component services and binding them together with data flows. Our strategy for service discovery is to delegate most of the operations to the network infrastructure and to automate them as much as possible. Based on the user ID and appliance ID, Omnisphere retrieves the information that restricts the set of possible services: User preferences, device capabilities, and context. It then makes use of existing discovery protocols such as SLP, Jini, or UPnP to discover relevant services and matches them with the required characteristics. Such a discovery process relieves appliances, which may have limited resources, from the operation that may consume scarce resources and may require the availability of different discovery protocols on the appliance.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174839","","Automatic control;Communication networks;Communication system control;Context-aware services;Home appliances;IP networks;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Protocols;Wireless networks","Internet;domestic appliances;meta data;personal communication networks;protocols;ubiquitous computing","Internet appliances;Jini;Omnisphere;SLP;UPnP;ambient networking;ambient services;appliance ID;channel elements;communication networks;component service discovery;control elements;device capabilities;discovery protocols;metadata;network infrastructure;personal communication environment;typed data flows;ubiquitous devices;user ID;user preferences;wireless appliances;wireless networks","","0","8","23","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A partial match query on a multidimensional file extracts all data whose attributes match the values of one or more attributes specified in the query. The disk allocation problem of a multidimensional file F on a database system with multiple disks accessible in parallel is the problem of distributing F among the disks such that the data qualifying for each partial match query are distributed as evenly as possible among the disks of the system. We propose an optimal solution to this problem for multidimensional files with pairwise prime domains based on a large and flexible class of maximum distance separable codes, namely, the redundant residue codes.

To solve the location problem we propose a genetic algorithm where solutions are evaluated based on their cost, their security and their efficiency levels. The genetic algorithm is embedded within a decision support tool to generate acceptable solutions to the decision maker.

The paper proposes a new image-based indexing scheme which enables the retrieval of data associated with an image. The approach proposed is based on using a hierarchy of color moments and offers a compromise between methods based on multiple color moments of segmented regions and those based on global color moments. The method retains positional information better than the above schemes and naturally leads to a multi-level comparison strategy where mismatches are quickly discarded at higher levels. Contrary to other schemes where three moments were used, the proposed methods provide better storage efficiency and less computational efforts as it only employs the first two moments. Simulation results show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:0-7803-7437-1","10.1109/ICSMC.2002.1175706","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175706","","Content based retrieval;Data engineering;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;database indexing;image colour analysis;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;image segmentation;visual databases","data retrieval;global color moments;hierarchical color moments;image indexing;image retrieval;images database;multi-level comparison strategy;positional information;segmented regions","","1","","19","","","6-9 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This framework is based on LCW (learning customer weights), a procedure for learning customer preferences represented as feature weights by observing customers' selections from return sets. An empirical evaluation on simulated customer behavior indicated that LCW's estimate of the mean preferences of a customer population improved as the number of customers increased, even for larger numbers of features of widely differing importance. This improvement in the estimate of mean customer preferences led to improved prediction of individual customer's rankings, irrespective of the extent of variation among customers and whether a single or multiple retrievals were permitted. The experimental results suggest that the return set that optimizes benefit may be smaller for customer populations with little variation than for customer populations with wide variation.","","POD:0-7695-1861-3","10.1109/ISEC.2002.1166916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166916","","Databases;Electronic commerce;Euclidean distance;Information retrieval;Logic gates;Marketing and sales;Refining","case-based reasoning;electronic commerce;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","cognitive load;customer preference learning;customer selections;customer weight learning;feature weights;individual customer rankings;inventory item;mean preferences;requirements satisfaction;retrievals;return-set size optimization;simulated customer behavior","","0","","17","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In environments where the service-providing enterprise has a huge customer base this task becomes formidable. An appealing solution is to automatically assign users to roles. The central contribution of this paper is to describe a model to dynamically assign users to roles based on a finite set of rules defined by the enterprise. These rules take into consideration the attributes of users and any constraints set forth by the enterprise's security policy. The model also allows dynamic revocation of assigned roles based on conditions specified in the security policy. The model provides a language to express these rules and defines a mechanism to determine seniority among different rules.

The phone-ngram representation stage provides a phoneme-level representation of the speech that can be searched efficiently. We present a novel method for phoneme-recognition using a vocabulary prefix tree to guide the creation of the phone-ngram index. The coarse search, consisting of phone-ngram matching, identifies regions of speech as putative word hits. The detailed acoustic match is then conducted only at the putative hits identified in the coarse match. This gives us vocabulary independence and the desired accuracy and speed in wordspotting. Current lattice-based phoneme-matching algorithms are similar to the coarse-match step of our algorithm. We show that our combined algorithm gives a factor of two improvement over the coarse match.

This paper explores the impact of such development on supply chains, contrasting between simple and complex product supply chains. The Auto-ID project is on track to enable such connectivity between products and information using a single, open-standard, data repository for storage and retrieval of product information. The potential impact on the design and management of supply chains is immense.

The method uses the document map as a representation of the semantic space of word contexts. The assumption is that similar meanings of a word have similar contexts, which are located in the same area on the self-organized document map. The results confirm this assumption.

"Towards an ontology for e-document management in public administration -the case of Schleswig-Holstein","R.

Proceedings of the","20030206","2003","","","9 pp.","","An action research project in the state administration of Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) seeks to answer the following questions: How can we organize and present e-documents so that users will be able to retrieve the document needed, or at least the information indicating the document? And what is the most effective and adequate way to proceed in the given administrative environment? In search for an appropriate solution, existing approaches in other public administrations have been evaluated. Findings reveal that (1) employing an ambitious ontology-based approach requires the implementation of a set of interrelated elements to support this application, and (2) the necessary allocation of resources is associated with a number of risks which a state government cannot or may not want to bear. The appropriate strategy seems to take first steps in developing and using controlled vocabulary while this process should be accompanied by ongoing evaluation and by networking with other actors in this field to support a collective strategy. Drawing on these insights the state administration now develops a broader approach towards e-document management.

This paper presents a multilingual NLIDB model based on case, which is motivated by the idea of case-based reasoning in machine learning. The model avoids the difficulties of constructing parsers for all intended supporting natural languages by storing every query pattern and its solution as a case into a casebase. Query sentence inputted by user is syntactically compared to cases in the casebase and the solution of the most similar case is reused to query the database. Each case is represented as a XML document fragment and the casebase is a valid XML document. All the facilities provided. by XML greatly enhanced the maintainability and scalability of the model.

Task complexity is a construct that has been used in many fields such as biology, computer science, and psychology. An objective of our current research effort is to be able to instantaneously assess change in the cognitive capabilities of people as they perform increasingly complex tasks. In order to address these broader goals, a better understanding of task complexity is needed. Specific questions we ask include: (1) What are the factors that contribute to task complexity? (2) What are effective ways to assess task complexity? and (3) How can task complexity be reduced in real-time tasks? In order to address these questions, we review literature related to task complexity across several domains such as user models, human computer interaction, human factors and instructional design.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174301","","Biology;Cognition;Computer science;Fatigue;Human computer interaction;Human factors;Information filtering;Information retrieval;Injuries;Psychology","cognition;human computer interaction;human factors;psychology;real-time systems;task analysis;user modelling","biology;cognitive capability change assessment;computer science;human computer interaction;human factors;instructional design;psychology;real-time adaptive augmented cognition;task complexity;user models","","1","","85","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we first present a requirement analysis and then present a wireless terminal-based transaction manager (TM) architecture. This architecture is based on the assumption that there is an application that supports certain business transaction(s) and that it uses the TM to store transactional state information and retrieve it after a communication link, application, or terminal crash. We present the design of such a TM, including the application interface, modules and log structure. A pilot implementation of this TM for the location-based application is also discussed. We further discuss other alternatives to design such a TM that together can be called ""ontological transaction monitor"". This acts as an intelligent component between the application and the servers accessed during m-commerce transactions and controls the perceivable communication behavior of the terminal towards the servers, maintains the state information and takes care of tight coupling of transactional properties of the computations as well as of security and privacy.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174215","","Business communication;Communication system control;Computer architecture;Computer crashes;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Information security;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Ontologies","Internet;electronic commerce;mobile communication;mobile computing;telecommunication security;transaction processing","Internet;business transaction;m-commerce;mobile e-commerce;ontological transaction monitor;transaction management;wireless terminal-based transaction manager","","5","","43","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this framework is to deal with problems that require planning with information to be gathered from the Web. Because of flexibility and efficiency reasons, MAPWEB decouples planning from information gathering by splitting a planning problem into two parts: solving an abstract problem and validating and completing abstract solutions by means of information gathering. We focus on the planning process in order to improve its efficiency. There are two ways of improving the efficiency of the MAPWEB planning algorithm: by accelerating the planning process itself and by storing previously solved planning problems. The first has been achieved by designing a cooperative planning algorithm that allows a set of planning agents to share plans and cooperate while planning to increase efficiency. The second is currently being designed and developed to allow planning agents to reuse the acquired knowledge. Finally, this paper presents experimental evaluation of the cooperative planning process when it is used by the planning agents.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:0-7803-7437-1","10.1109/ICSMC.2002.1176442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176442","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Intelligent systems;Multiagent systems;Process planning;Query processing","Internet;information retrieval;multi-agent systems;planning (artificial intelligence);software agents","MAPWEB;Web information retrieval agents;abstract problem;cooperative planning algorithm;information gathering;multiagent framework;planning agents","","1","","11","","","6-9 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, in this paper, we demonstrate that a medical knowledge acquisition/management system can be built upon a three-tier distributed client/server structure. The knowledge in the system is stored/managed in three knowledge bases, and the knowledge flow through these knowledge bases is dependent on the degree of the maturity of the medical know-how. Furthermore, to facilitate the knowledge representation in these knowledge bases as well as information retrieval across the Internet, an 8-digit coding scheme is proposed.

Recently, there have been investigations on how to reorganize an existing online catalog based on some criteria, but none of them has addressed the problem of organizing an online catalog automatically from scratch. This paper attempts to tackle this problem. We model an online catalog organization as a decision tree structure and propose a metric, based on the popularity of products and the relative importance of product attribute values, to evaluate the quality of a catalog organization. The problem is then formulated as a decision tree construction problem. Although traditional decision tree algorithms, such as C4.5, can be used to generate online catalog organization, the catalog constructed is generally not good based on our metric. An efficient greedy algorithm (GENCAT) is thus developed, and the experimental results show that GENCAT produces better catalog organizations based on our metric.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2002.806055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176888","","Computer science;Decision trees;Greedy algorithms;Information retrieval;Information systems;Libraries;Mathematics;Organizing;Search engines;Topology","Web design;decision trees;electronic commerce;optimisation;topology","GENCAT;decision tree;electronic commerce;greedy algorithm;metric;online catalog;product attribute values;tree optimization;web site","","6","1","19","","","Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, a simple and effective blind watermark scheme is needed urgently. In this paper, we attempt to resolve the problems. Here, we present two general blind watermark schemes, based on the lattice principle and property of periodic function, respectively. By using these schemes, the host data interference is eliminated entirely and only a little storage cost is needed. Thus, they have considerable advantages over previously proposed schemes.","","POD:0-7695-1623-8","10.1109/WDM.2002.1176204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176204","","Application software;Computer science;Cryptography;Information retrieval;Interference;Nonlinear distortion;Protection;Spread spectrum communication;Steganography;Watermarking","data encapsulation;multimedia computing;watermarking","blind watermark schemes;digital watermarking;embedded information retrieval;host data interference elimination;lattice principle;multimedia applications;periodic function;storage cost","","0","","15","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fourth IEEE International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces","20030122","2002","","","253","258","Translation of named entities (NE), including proper names, temporal and numerical expressions, is very important in multilingual natural language processing, like crosslingual information retrieval and statistical machine translation. We present an integrated approach to extract a named entity translation dictionary from a bilingual corpus while at the same time improving the named entity annotation quality. Starting from a bilingual corpus where the named entities are extracted independently for each language, a statistical alignment model is used to align the named entities. An iterative process is applied to extract named entity pairs with higher alignment probability. This leads to a smaller but cleaner named entity translation dictionary and also to a significant improvement of the monolingual named entity annotation quality for both languages. Experimental result shows that the dictionary size is reduced by 51.8% and the annotation quality is improved from 70.03 to 78.15 for Chinese and 73.38 to 81.46 in terms of F-score.","","POD:0-7695-1834-6","10.1109/ICMI.2002.1167002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167002","","Costs;Data mining;Dictionaries;Humans;Information retrieval;Interactive systems;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Probability;Surface-mount technology","computational linguistics;dictionaries;language translation;natural language interfaces;probability","Chinese;F-score;bilingual named entity extraction;crosslingual information retrieval;dictionary;experimental result;multilingual natural language processing;named entity annotation quality;named entity translation;probability;statistical alignment model;statistical machine translation","","5","","9","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Alternative interest measures for mining associations in databases","E. R.

Discovering associations between items in a large database is one such data mining activity. In finding associations, support is used as an indicator as to whether an association is interesting. In this paper, we discuss three alternative interest measures for associations: any-confidence, all-confidence, and bond. We prove that the important downward closure property applies to both all-confidence and bond. We show that downward closure does not hold for any-confidence. We also prove that, if associations have a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond, then those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum support and the rules produced from those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum confidence as well. However, associations that have that minimum support (and likewise their rules that have minimum confidence) may not satisfy the minimum all-confidence or minimum bond constraint. We describe the algorithms that efficiently find all associations with a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond and present some experimental results.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1161582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1161582","","Association rules;Bonding;Counting circuits;Data mining;Decision making;Helium;Information retrieval;Itemsets;Marketing and sales;Transaction databases","data mining;database management systems","all-confidence interest measure;alternative interest measures;any-confidence interest measure;association mining;associations;bond interest measure;data mining;databases;downward closure property","","150","2","28","","","Jan.-Feb. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
