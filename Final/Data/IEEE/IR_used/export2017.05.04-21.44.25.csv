One of the key components of tele-presence systems is automatic awareness of the remote environment. This very same capability of automatic situation awareness is currently being developed and deployed in the context of the next generation smart surveillance systems. Smart surveillance systems use a number of automatic video analysis techniques like object detection, tracking and classification in conjunction with database and Web application servers to provide users with the capability of distributed smart surveillance. The IBM smart surveillance system is one of the few advanced surveillance systems which provides not only the capability to automatically monitor a scene but also the capability to manage the surveillance data, perform event based retrieval, receive real time event alerts thru standard web infrastructure and extract long term statistical patterns of activity.","2379-1268;23791268","POD:0-7803-9000-8","10.1109/WOCC.2005.1553781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553781","","Biographies;Computerized monitoring;Context awareness;Data mining;Distributed databases;Information retrieval;Layout;Object detection;Real time systems;Surveillance","Internet;file servers;surveillance;virtual reality","IBM smart surveillance system;S3-R1;automatic video analysis techniques;object classification;object detection;object tracking;telepresence systems","","2","","","","","22-23 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes and compares the approaches for the Urdu lexicon implementation. Raw lexicon as a simple word list is expensive both for search time and space. Using hash table with appropriate hash functions fast searching times, close to perfect hashing are achieved. Hashing results in a simpler acceptable lexicon design on the cost of some extra space. Lexicon storage using trie reduces both search time and size. Further enhancement is achieved by converting trie into directed acyclic word graph. Using which automatic separation of word stems from prefixes and suffixes is performed. Only high frequency prefixes and suffixes having productive morphological information are retained for the final lexical transducer. Comparison reveals that lexical transducer implementation is relatively more complex than hashing, due to morphological analysis requirement, but it is efficient for both search time and storage space requirements.","","POD:0-7803-8871-2","10.1109/SCONES.2004.1564764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564764","Finite State Automata;Hash Table;Lexical Transducer;Urdu Lexicon","Application software;Automata;Costs;Frequency;Information retrieval;Morphology;Natural language processing;Speech synthesis;Synthesizers;Transducers","","Finite State Automata;Hash Table;Lexical Transducer;Urdu Lexicon","","1","","14","","","30-31 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed data reduction technique, CheckDup, is required to manage the voluminous e-evidence data to the manageable amount. Information retrieval may be context-based or content-based. Context-based retrieval requires event time, URL, and the client's IP address, whereas content-based retrieval may be accomplished via free-text search. A verification process compares hash codes kept in the database and the regenerated ones from the just-retrieved Web page. Data integrity is confirmed, should the comparison result shows similar hash codes.

Thus is, each cluster mean vector is updated, only after all document vectors being assigned, as the (normalized) average of all the document vectors assigned to that cluster. This paper investigates an online version of the spherical k-means algorithm based on the well-known winner-take-all competitive learning. In this online algorithm, each cluster centroid is incrementally updated given a document. We demonstrate that the online spherical k-means algorithm can achieve significantly better clustering results than the batch version, especially when an annealing-type learning rate schedule is used.

However, the file ADT has not been given a formal semantics. Access to data stored in an ADT is through its interfaces. These interfaces and the operations that they represent should be rigorously defined so as to guarantee that their use will give expected results. This paper illustrates the use of real-time process algebra (RTPA) to formally describe both the data and operations of the file ADT. The difficulties in the file ADT specification are the formal description of its logical and physical models. The logical model of the file ADT is modeled using an indexing mechanism in which each record stored in the file is accessed through its address.

As a supervised learning technique, it has been shown to significantly increase the retrieval accuracy. However, as a CBIR system continues to receive user queries and user feedbacks, the information of user preferences across query sessions are often lost at the end of search, thus requiring the feedback process to be restarted for each new query. A few works targeting long-term learning have been done in general CBIR domain to alleviate this problem. However, none of them address the needs and long-term similarity learning techniques for region-based image retrieval. This paper proposes a latent semantic indexing (LSI) based method to utilize users' relevance feedback information. The proposed region-based image retrieval system is constructed on a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework with one-class support vector machine (SVM) as its core. Experiments show that the proposed method can better utilize users' feedbacks of previous sessions, thus improving the performance of the learning algorithm (one-class SVM).","","POD:0-7695-2489-3","10.1109/ISM.2005.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565811","","Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Machine learning;Radio frequency;Supervised learning;Support vector machines","image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);relevance feedback;support vector machines","latent semantic indexing;learning algorithm;multiple instance learning;region-based image retrieval;relevance feedback;support vector machine","","14","","13","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The outcome is latent semantic mapping, a data-driven framework for modeling global relationships implicit in large volumes of (not necessarily textual) data.

A next generation spoken document retrieval (SDR) system would require a more diverse set of speech criteria including speaker, accent/dialect, language, stress/emotion and environment content. The proposed accent/dialect tagging system for SDR is based on several recent advances in a multi-dimensional space. Here, temporal and spectral based features including the stochastic trajectory model (STM), pitch structure, formant location and voice onset time (VOT) are considered. Mono-phone based STM (MP-STM) is shown to be the most successful for dialect classification with an average rate of 96.5% for read speech and 72.5% for spontaneous speech, while classifying four dialects.

Owing to its generality, we have built, evaluated and optimized a prototype of a distance-based image retrieval system. We show that under a metric distance function, image data is intrinsically low dimensional. We investigate the performance of three distance-based index structures (M-tree, RBT-index, and MVP-index), and, to optimize the construction of MVP-indexes, develop new heuristics that seek centers as pivots and partition the data according to its intrinsic clustering.

The indexing method is based on a new coding scheme that assigns unique numbers to the elements on all possible paths of the tree representing the XML document. The coding scheme is based on the DTD (data type definition) of the XML file. Elements are stored in internal data structures in such a way that they can be directly accessed via the unique coding.

In speaker indexing, the reliability of speaker model depends much on segmentation. Commonly used methods are based on the Bayesian information criteria (BIC), which is however not so capable when dealing with short utterances. In this paper, we present a pitch-based speech segmentation method, which can detect frequent speaker changes accurately and rapidly. In our algorithm, pitch is introduced in speaker segmentation. Firstly, utterance segments are detected by pitch. Then distances of pitch are computed, and compared with a self-adaptable threshold. Speaker changes are finally decided among utterance segments. We applied our method and three comparative methods on the HUB4-NE broadcast data. Speaker indexing experiments have been taken following each algorithm. We also suggested two indicators as complements of false alarm and missing rate in the evaluation of segmentation. The experiment results show that our algorithm works faster and better, with most of short time speaker changes detected. Speaker indexing equal error rate of our method is 10.43%, which is much lower than 12.94%, 25.84% and 15.91% of other methods.","","POD:0-7695-2489-3","10.1109/ISM.2005.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565884","","Application software;Bayesian methods;Broadcasting;Computer science;Data analysis;Educational institutions;Error analysis;Indexing;Information retrieval;Speech","speech processing","Bayesian information criteria;HUB4-NE broadcast data;pitch-based rapid speech segmentation;self-adaptable threshold;speaker indexing;utterance segment","","2","","14","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When generating the database, the evaluation of the associated modeling uncertainties is crucial for retrieval error estimation. However, this is extremely complex due to the large number of free parameters. In this work, a possible methodology for taking into account CRD-related modeling uncertainties is proposed. The methodology-fairly general-is here applied to a limited dataset (a cloud-model resolved numerical output of a tropical cyclone). The modeling errors are obtained from systematic TB sensitivity tests associated to several parameters: particle sizes, temperature, ice content, sea surface wind speed, viewing angle, footprint size, radiative transfer schemes, melting phase, and particle shape. TB uncertainties are eventually summarized in a modeling error covariance matrix representing the intrinsic variability of the generated CRD. For comparison with real observations, the TBs are simulated at the spatial resolution, viewing geometry and frequencies of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). The matrix is evaluated with respect to TMI data in terms of an indicator called database matching index. Since they are based on a single case study and suffer from the lack of direct coupling of the radiative transfer with the cloud-resolving model, the provided results should not be considered an exhaustive evaluation of cloud-radiation modeling errors. Nevertheless, they may be considered a valuable starting point for error characterization, since extensions to larger databases could definitely improve modeling error budgets.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.860484","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564397","Error modeling;estimation uncertainties;retrieval","Brightness temperature;Clouds;Covariance matrix;Databases;Error analysis;Information retrieval;Microwave theory and techniques;Ocean temperature;Tropical cyclones;Uncertainty","atmospheric radiation;atmospheric techniques;clouds;data acquisition;microwave measurement;radiative transfer;rain;remote sensing","Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager;brightness temperature;cloud profile;cloud-model resolved numerical output;cloud-resolving model;database matching index;microwave spaceborne technique;modeling error covariance matrix;modeling uncertainty;passive microwave precipitation retrieval;radiative transfer;rainfall retrieval;simulated cloud radiation database;tropical cyclone","","9","","48","","","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The performance of a content-based information retrieval (CBIR) system is very subjective and hence user-dependent. To the user, similarity between objects in the database is often high-level and semantic. However, features extracted from objects directly in their digital representations are often low-level features. The gap between low-level features and high-level semantics has been the major obstacle to better retrieval performance. In this talk, we outline several approaches to bridging the gap between low-level features and high-level semantics, including hidden annotation and relevance feedback. We present a few specific techniques: active learning, annotation propagation, feature space warping, and semantic metric linking, all aiming at propagating the semantics from some objects to the others.","","POD:0-7695-2489-3","10.1109/ISM.2005.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565830","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Extraterrestrial measurements;Feature extraction;Feedback;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;information retrieval systems;relevance feedback","active learning;annotation propagation;content-based information retrieval;digital representation;feature extraction;feature space warping;hidden annotation;high-level semantics;low-level features;relevance feedback;semantic metric linking","","0","","","","","14-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the ""visual salience guided mesh decomposition"" scheme we proposed previously, a 3D shape represented in mesh form is first broken into parts such that human visual perception of the parts can be appropriately mimicked. Next, the decomposed parts are individually analyzed and quantified according to the properties of visual salience. To establish the indices of 3D meshes for the subsequent retrieval process, spherical parameterization is adopted to map the decomposed parts onto the surface of a unit sphere. In this way, the degree of similarity between a query provided by a user and models in the database can be calculated.

To improve the performance of disk arrays, a good cache replacement algorithm is needed in the cache. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named the write-prior partitioning least recently used (WPP-LRU) algorithm, which distinguishes the ports and distinguishes the write blocks from the read blocks in the cache. The LRU algorithm is only used to the read blocks in each port and some especial operations are performed for all write blocks in the cache. A simulation model is developed and the simulation results show that the WPP-LRU algorithm can improve the performance of disk arrays by reducing the hit service time remarkably while it keeps the same hit ratio as the standard LRU. The WPP-LRU algorithm has a good expandability because some good algorithms can be used in the read blocks of each port to improve the hit ratio, such as the LRU-K algorithm, the 2-Q algorithm and so on, and this will not change the idea of the WPP-LRU algorithm","","POD:0-7695-2432-X","10.1109/CIT.2005.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1562670","","Cache memory;Computer applications;Computer architecture;Information retrieval;Information technology;Joining processes;Partitioning algorithms;Sections;Standards development;Switches","cache storage;disc storage","WPP-LRU algorithm;cache replacement algorithm;disk arrays;interface processors;multiport cache;write-prior partitioning least recently used algorithm","","0","1","13","","","21-23 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The parameters used in defining the measure capture the global relationships among the features. We provide an algorithm to learn the dissimilarity measure automatically from a set of user specified comparisons in the form ""x is closer to y than to z"" and study its performance.

These families are specially useful for information retrieval from large databases, high-dimensional spaces and complex distance functions which usually consume a long time. They are generated by incorporating spatial access method (SAM) and metric access method (MAM) into SOM with the maximum insertion rate, i.e. the case when a new unit is created for each pattern presented to the network. In this specific case, the network presents interesting advantages and acquires new properties which are quite different of traditional SOM. In a constructive SOM, if new units are rarely inserted into network, the training algorithm would probably need a long time to converge. On the other hand, if new units are inserted frequently, the training algorithm would not have enough time to adapt these units to the data distribution. Besides, training time is increased because the search for the winning neuron is traditionally performed sequentially. The use of SAM and MAM combined with SOM open the possibility of training constructive SOM with as much units as existing patterns with less time and interesting advantages compared with both models: Kohonen network SOM and SAMSOM model (SOM using SAM). Advantages and drawbacks of these new families are also discussed. These new families are useful to improve both SOM and SAM techniques.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:0-7803-9048-2","10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556397","","Clustering algorithms;Computational complexity;Computational efficiency;Computer Society;Cost function;Data analysis;High performance computing;Information retrieval;Neurons;Spatial databases","learning (artificial intelligence);self-organising feature maps","Kohonen network;constructive self-organizing map;data distribution;metric access method;spatial access method;training algorithm","","0","","23","","","31 July-4 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A complete system is presented, from region extraction of a full hemisphere scan to the actual retrieval mechanism. After region extraction, polygonal approximation is applied to the region shape, and local features of the polygons are hashed to provide an association space. This space becomes the indexing structure through which retrieval takes place. Although the indexing stage, containing region extraction and polygonal approximation, is slow, the actual retrieval is very fast. On average, retrieval of a query shape from a database of 1965 shapes takes 0.7 seconds for the more reduced representation, and 2.8 seconds for the less reduced representation consisting of 1914 shapes. The overall design is good for a moderately sized database, and extensions could be made to apply the method to a massive database. The results show that the approach performs well, and that there is a substantial speed benefit for using the local association hashing method.","","POD:0-7695-2489-3","10.1109/ISM.2005.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565881","","Clouds;Content based retrieval;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Infrared imaging;Remote sensing;Satellites;Shape;Weather forecasting","","","","2","","23","","","14-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our intuition is that these users act differently and the unique high performance cluster environment is constrained such that command behavior discrimination is enhanced versus enterprise environments. We formalize this into a classification problem to be solved by a support vector machine with TF-IDF feature construction techniques from the field of Information Retrieval.

We use the assumption that parts of the system that use similar terms are related. We cluster artifacts that use similar terms, and we reveal the most relevant terms for the computed clusters. Our approach works at the level of the source code which makes it language independent.

A method of feature extraction and comparison is proposed, which uses Zernike moments for invariant pattern recognition as shape features of images' regions of interest. A new algorithm that generates statistical-based association rules is used to identify representative features that discriminate the disease classes of images. In order to minimize the computational effort, another new algorithm, based on fractal theory, is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the representative feature space. In essence, the proposed method determines the smallest set of relevant features that can properly represent images without loss of precision. In addition, the method discards the need of image segmentation, leading to a simple but effective way to make image retrieval by content. Experiments executing k-nearest neighbor queries on medical images reveal that the process is robust and suitable to perform retrieval combined with classification of this kind of images.","","POD:0-7695-2489-3","10.1109/ISM.2005.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565883","","Association rules;Biomedical imaging;Data mining;Feature extraction;Fractals;Image processing;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Pattern recognition;Shape","Zernike polynomials;content-based retrieval;data mining;feature extraction;image classification;image retrieval;medical image processing;statistical analysis","Zernike moment;content based image retrieval;data mining;feature extraction;fractal theory;image processing;image representation;invariant pattern recognition;k-nearest neighbor query;medical image classification;medical image shape retrieval;relevant feature;shape based retrieval;statistical-based association rule","","4","","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method can be used in automatic music transcription systems and music information retrieval systems to reduce a performance of a music piece to the printed or digital score. The system takes only the onset data of performed music from either MIDI or audio, and determine the best maximal grid level onto which to fit the note onsets. This maximal grid level, or tatum, is allowed to vary from section to section in a piece. We obtain the optimal segmentation of the piece using dynamic programming. We present results from an audio based performance of Milhaud's Botafogo, as well as several MIDI performances of the Rondo-Allegro from Beethoven's Pathetique. The results show a reduction of error compared to quantization based only on one global metric level, and promises to create rhythm transcriptions that are parsimonious and readable.","","POD:0-7695-2489-3","10.1109/ISM.2005.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565885","","Bars;Dynamic programming;Humans;Instruments;Music information retrieval;Performance evaluation;Quantization;Rhythm;Standardization;Viterbi algorithm","acoustic signal processing;audio signal processing;dynamic programming;music","Beethoven Pathetique;MIDI;Milhaud Botafogo;Rondo-Allegro;adaptive tatum assignment;audio based performance;automatic music transcription system;dynamic programming;maximal grid level;music information retrieval system;music segmentation;rhythm transcription","","0","","18","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the potential applications of CBIR is in industrial areas where the most relevant drawings or images can be retrieved speedily without the need to memorize any file name or specific key-words. To increase the retrieval speed, most of the systems pre-process the stored images by extracting a set of predefined features. Such scheme only works well for the server type database systems where the images have been stored previously. It is not feasible for systems that analyze images in real-time where the images are stored or added on an ongoing basis. For instance, personal image search engine for the World-Wide-Web is such an example.

In a typical text database application, a user chooses k=1, 2, 3, or 4). Our index structure is built on the underlying vocabulary of the text database. The new technique has two principal components - a new data structure called the V-tree and its partition methods for clustering words in the vocabulary into subgroups. We have implemented our index structure and conducted experiments on real-world data. Our experiments show that even for very large text database, the construction of our index and a search for keywords that match the query word approximately can be done quickly.

An effective measure for musical similarity impacts music indexing and classification in music retrieval systems. The proposed method creates key distributions from polyphonic music, and compares the key distributions of pairs of pieces, by calculating their correlation coefficient, to determine a degree of similarity between them. The proposed method assumes no knowledge of the time structure of the piece, nor does it require pieces to be the same length. We present results using this method to assess similarity among selected variations by Mozart. The results show that the correlation coefficients of pieces from the same set of variations are centered on 0.88 (with a standard deviation of 0.11), and that of pieces across different sets of variations are centered on 0.32 (with a standard deviation of 0.31).","","POD:0-7695-2489-3","10.1109/ISM.2005.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565887","","Content based retrieval;Fingerprint recognition;Frequency;Histograms;Indexing;Music information retrieval;Statistics;Systems engineering and theory;Viterbi algorithm","classification;indexing;information retrieval;information retrieval systems;music","Mozart;key distributions;music classification;music indexing;music retrieval systems;musical fingerprints;polyphonic music;similarity assessment","","1","","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The metric histogram represents a compact, but efficient alternative to the use of traditional gray level histograms to represent images. The global warp metric distance (GWMD) enhances the comparison between histograms, replacing the rigid bin to bin evaluation by the warp method, which allows a local ""adjustment"" of one histogram to the other during the distance calculation, introducing a global matching of the curves. Besides this, GWMD applies a set of geometric global features of histograms to determine the final distance. Results on similarity retrieval in medical images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in analyzing image sets that present brightness and contrast disparities: it reduces the amount of both false positive and false negative retrievals. Moreover, these results comply with similarity evaluations performed by domain specialists.","","POD:0-7695-2489-3","10.1109/ISM.2005.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565846","","Biomedical imaging;Boosting;Brightness;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexes;Information retrieval","content-based retrieval;database indexing;image retrieval;visual databases","content based image retrieval;false negative retrieval;false positive retrieval;geometric global feature;global curve matching;global warp metric distance;gray level histogram;image database indexing;image representation;image set analysis;metric histogram;similarity retrieval evaluation","","2","","15","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus efficient and effective integration of learning objects becomes the key part of this activity. UNIT (UREKA navigation and integration toolkit) is emerging model for such type of integration. It defines CMF (common media framework) that has a predefined schema for integration of learning objects, and also the capability of handling spatial und temporal behavior for learning activity separately. Furthermore, it allows users to modify these behaviors and to attach presentational templates of their own comfort that provide reusability of both the integrated information and templates.

The simple, clear data structure based on objects makes the system easy to implement and feasible. For a figure that consists of a set of regions in two-dimensional plane, there exists a corresponding consistent PLCA expression. For a consistent PLCA expression, there is a unique figure in two-dimensional plane in the sense of connection pattern, if there exists. Topological reasoning can be performed on a PLCA expression, such as judging the connection patterns of areas. We define the operations of area integration and area division on a PLCA expression. These operations preserve the consistency of the expression, and they correspond to the real actions on figures. We can add attributes to each object, such as the properties that hold on an area or that an object stands for, and make an attributed PLCA. The operations of area integration/division on an attributed PLCA corresponds to the alteration of the classification level of objects.

We applied active learning techniques based on support vector machine for evaluating successive hatches, which is called relevance feedback. Our proposed approach has been very useful for document retrieval with relevance feedback experimentally. The relevance feedback needs a set of relevant and non-relevant documents to work usefully. However, the initial retrieved documents, which are displayed to a user, sometimes don't include relevant documents. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new feedback method using information of non-relevant documents only. We named this method non-relevance feedback document retrieval.

This paper proposes a framework for the description and retrieval of multimedia data. The data are represented at both the syntactic (structure, metadata and low level features) and semantic (the meaning of the data) levels. We use the MPEG-7 standard, which provides a set of tools to describe multimedia content from different viewpoints, to represent the syntactic level. However, due to its XML schema based representation, MPEG-7 is not suitable to represent the semantic aspect of the data in a formal and concise way. Moreover, inferential mechanisms are not provided. To alleviate these limitations, we propose to extend MPEG-7 with a domain ontology, formalized using a logical formalism. Then, the semantic aspect of the data is described using the ontology's vocabulary, as a set of logical expressions. We enhance the ontology by a rules layer, to describe more complex constraints between domain concepts and relations. User's queries may concern the syntactic and/or semantic features. The syntactic constraints are expressed using XQuery language and evaluated using an XML query engine; whereas the semantic query constraints are expressed using a rules language and evaluated using a specific resolution mechanism.","","POD:0-7695-2489-3","10.1109/ISM.2005.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565839","","Content management;Engines;Informatics;Information retrieval;Logic;MPEG 7 Standard;MPEG standards;Ontologies;Vocabulary;XML","XML;formal logic;information retrieval;multimedia systems;programming language semantics;query languages","MPEG-7 standard;XML query engine;XML schema based representation;XQuery language;logic based approach;metadata;multimedia data representation;multimedia data retrieval;rules language;semantic query constraint;syntactic constraint","","1","","15","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, with sampling applied, those points which are not sampled will not have their labels. Although there is a straightforward approach in the numerical domain, the problem of how to allocate those unlabeled data points into proper clusters remains as a challenging issue in the categorical domain. In this paper, a mechanism named MAximal Resemblance Data Labeling (abbreviated as MARDL) is proposed to allocate each unlabeled data point into the corresponding appropriate cluster based on the novel categorical clustering representative, namely, Node Importance Representative (abbreviated as NIR), which represents clusters by the importance of attribute values. MARDL has two advantages: (1) MARDL exhibits high execution efficiency; (2) after each unlabeled data is allocated into the proper cluster, MARDL preserves clustering characteristics, i.e., high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity. MARDL is empirically validated via real and synthetic data sets, and is shown to be not only more efficient than prior methods but also attaining results of better quality.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:0-7695-2278-5","10.1109/ICDM.2005.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565668","categorical clustering;data labeling;data mining","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Labeling;Machine learning;NP-hard problem;Pattern recognition;Sampling methods","data mining;database management systems;pattern clustering;sampling methods","categorical clustering;data mining;important attribute values;maximal resemblance data labeling;node importance representative;sampling technique;unclustered categorical data","","9","1","16","","","27-30 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By catching all application operations on input files, these operations are directed towards the remote copy on the server, thus eliminating the need for transferring the complete input file. This implementation is targeted at the minimum intrusion grid project, which strives for minimum intrusion on the resource executing a job.

Multiple mechanical parts are usually drawn on each engineering drawing. Therefore designers want to find engineering drawings containing parts similar to a query image in the shape of a part drawn on an engineering drawing. In this paper, we propose a novel similarity based partial image retrieval system for engineering drawings. A unique aspect of this system is that a graph representation is utilized to robustly find engineering drawings containing similar parts which are invariant to the size, position, and rotation. We verified the performance for the similarity based partial image retrieval system through experiments using industrial engineering drawings. The results show that the top five similar engineering drawings for every query image are always accurately retrieved by our proposed system. This finding suggests that this system could be useful for the reuse of stored engineering drawings.","","POD:0-7695-2489-3","10.1109/ISM.2005.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565847","","Automobile manufacture;Engineering drawings;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Mechanical products;Product design;Research and development;Shape","engineering computing;image retrieval;technical drawing","graph representation;industrial engineering drawing;mechanical product database;partial image retrieval system;query image data;similarity based image retrieval;stored engineering drawing","","0","4","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The agent built with this architecture has the ability of deliberating on new beliefs and executing current intentions at once. The agent also has the ability to prioritize the deliberations and intention executions so it is able to respond quickly to circumstance changes and all the thinking and acting are done at appropriate times. It is in fact a more natural way to simulate human minds since we are always doing several things simultaneously. The parallel architecture consists of three parallel running components which are the belief manager, the intention generator and the intention executor. The coordination between the parallel components is done by interrupts of different priorities. The various levels of priorities include matters that need to be deliberated/acted on (1) immediately and in shortest time possible, (2) immediately without hurrying, (3) at some fixed time in future, (4) in future when the agent has time. Matters at these different priority levels will be handled differently. To evaluate this architecture, a simulation system of vessel agents traveling in sea is developed.

The problem of reliable speech recognition for information retrieval is a challenging problem when data is recorded across different media, known/unknown equipment, and different speaking environments. In this talk, we consider problems in audio stream phrase recognition for spoken document retrieval from audio materials spanning the past 110 years. When considering audio transcription for SDR, what should be transcribed? Audio content for broadcast news includes commercials, competing speakers, radio call-in shows, background music, over a wide range of recording conditions. This talk considers the evolution of SDR needed over the past 100 years, with emphasis on acoustics due to speaker, noise, and equipment, while text processing based concepts are considered in the following presentation by Jerome Bellegarda, Apple Corp. Early recordings during the late 1890's and early 1900's were carefully structured and scripted, but employed Edison wax cylinder disk recording formats resulting in reasonable speech structure but poor acoustic recordings. As the cost and ease of recording speeches, debates, and broadcast transmissions evolved, less structured audio content becomes more common with a wider range of equipment. The explosion of audio materials, audio Web portals, audio file-sharing frameworks, makes cataloging and organizing audio content for SDR increasingly important and challenging. Varying audio formats for file sharing, as well as the need to ensure ownership through digital watermarking, introduces a number of issues that can also impact speech recognition performance for SDR. We consider a number of areas and approaches taken for effective SDR, and discuss directions for future information detection schemes for richer information retrieval for the next generation of SDR. Finally, as audio material continues to expand at a rapid pace, automatic transcription support for digital archives and libraries is needed in the future","","CD-ROM:0-7803-9479-8; POD:0-7803-9478-X","10.1109/ASRU.2005.1566463","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1566463","","Acoustic noise;Audio recording;Disk recording;Information retrieval;Loudspeakers;Music information retrieval;Radio broadcasting;Speech recognition;Streaming media;Text processing","audio signal processing;information retrieval;peer-to-peer computing;speech recognition;watermarking","audio Web portals;audio file-sharing frameworks;audio materials;audio stream phrase recognition;automatic transcription support;digital watermarking;information retrieval;speech recognition;spoken document retrieval","","0","","","","","Nov. 27 2005-Dec. 1 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Improving automatic query classification via semi-supervised learning","S. M. Beitzel; E. C. Jensen; O. Frieder; D. D. Lewis; A. Chowdhury; A. Kolcz","","Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'05)","20060103","2005","","","8 pp.","","Accurate topical classification of user queries allows for increased effectiveness and efficiency in general-purpose Web search systems. Such classification becomes critical if the system is to return results not just from a general Web collection but from topic-specific back-end databases as well. Maintaining sufficient classification recall is very difficult as Web queries are typically short, yielding few features per query. This feature sparseness coupled with the high query volumes typical for a large-scale search service makes manual and supervised learning approaches alone insufficient. We use an application of computational linguistics to develop an approach for mining the vast amount of unlabeled data in Web query logs to improve automatic topical Web query classification. We show that our approach in combination with manual matching and supervised learning allows us to classify a substantially larger proportion of queries than any single technique. We examine the performance of each approach on a real Web query stream and show that our combined method accurately classifies 46% of queries, outperforming the recall of best single approach by nearly 20%, with a 7% improvement in overall effectiveness.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:0-7695-2278-5","10.1109/ICDM.2005.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565660","","Computer science;Databases;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Manuals;Search engines;Semisupervised learning;Supervised learning;Web search","Internet;classification;computational linguistics;data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);search engines","Web query classification;Web query logs;Web search systems;automatic query classification;computational linguistics;data mining;manual matching;semisupervised learning;topical classification","","17","9","22","","","27-30 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Color descriptors from the MPEG7 standard are used, including dominant color, color layout, color structure and scalable color experiments are presented that compare the performance of these, and also compare automatic and manual techniques to examine the sensitivity of the retrieval rate on segmentation accuracy.

Although various pLSA-based applications, ranging from information retrieval, information filtering, to text-mining and visualization, have been successfully conducted, they can not afford dynamic revising of model when one of the factors changes constantly. In this paper, we take the advantage of decoupling ability of pLSA thoroughly, and propose a more elegant approach based on maximum likelihood estimation to gain an incremental learning with the drift of a factor. We demonstrate our method in the context of collaborative filtering where single user interests change fast, but the community interests remain almost constant.

"The utility of compound wireless services","T. J. A. Kobylarz","A&T Wireless Services, Redmond, WA, USA","14th Annual International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications, 2005. WOCC 2005","20051219","2005","","","29","30","Summary form only given. This talk will provide examples within a data services class that have the potential of substantial capital returns. This class of data services is termed compound wireless (mobile communication) services or CWS's. Compound wireless services are beyond 3G and are not now available. Nor are they planned for 3G wireless systems. However, they represent a natural extension beyond 3G and provide an incentive for users/subscribers to desire 3G data services. It is believed that compound wireless services make the wireless telecommunications terminal an indispensable data tool and subjugate voice communications to a secondary service. That is, the CWS class contains many ""killer"" application services. A compound wireless service is a service consisting of linked component services. When invoked, a CWS causes the component services to be executed in a sequence prescribed by the CWS. The following CWS example is intended to assist in defining this class of services. Consider having a severe time constraint for driving a vehicle between two geographic points. This may apply to commuting between one's home and a place of employment, or for a limousine driver to arrive at an airport in time for a passenger's flight, or for a chartered bus to reach its tour destination in a timely manner, etc. The main three component services employed to achieve this need are presented. The user/subscriber programmed wireless service consists of continual iterations of these three services until the destination is reached. The iteration sequence can consist of the steps, which are discussed in this paper.","2379-1268;23791268","POD:0-7803-9000-8","10.1109/WOCC.2005.1553715","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553715","","3G mobile communication;Airports;Communication industry;Delay;Engineering profession;Information retrieval;Investments;Mobile communication;Standards publication;Wireless communication","3G mobile communication;data communication;telecommunication services","beyond 3G;compound wireless services;data services;linked component services;mobile communication","","0","","","","","22-23 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
