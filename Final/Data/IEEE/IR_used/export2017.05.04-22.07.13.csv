"Proper referencing of prior art","R. P.

As mentioned at that time, omitting related work is not only unfair to researcher(s) who have made earlier contributions to the field but it also gives a distorted view of the topic to the reader. More importantly, it demonstrates an author??s lack of knowledge of prior art in their area of research. Hence, there may be significant room for improvement in the technical quality of the manuscript. Since then, we have continually sensitized the authors to this important issue before adopting the following measures. Every year, the Electron Devices Society (EDS) confers its prestigious Paul Rappaport and the more recent George Smith (2002) Awards for best papers published in our flagship publications IEEE T-ED and IEEE Electron Device Letters (EDL), respectively. To reward proper citation philosophy in EDS publications, we have now instituted clear guidelines to take this factor into account in the paper selection process for these awards. Also, we have tightened up the manuscript review process for both T-ED and EDL to make incomplete citations as grounds for rejection.","0741-3106;07413106","","10.1109/LED.2008.2011872","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752787","","Electron Devices Society;Guidelines;Information retrieval","","","","0","","5","","20090119","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The load survey is applied to derive the typical load patterns of residential, commercial, and industrial customer classes. The power consumption of sample test customers and weather information are used to solve the hourly temperature sensitivity of power consumption for each customer class. All the customers served by each distribution transformer are identified and their monthly energy consumption is retrieved from the customer information system in Taipower. The hourly loading of each service zone and its change due to temperature rise are obtained based on the customer load consumption and its temperature sensitivity. By performing the connectivity trace to find the feeder configuration and executing the three-phase load flow analysis, the hourly current loading of line switches, distribution feeders, and main transformers in substations is solved. The binary integer programming is then applied to determine the temperature adaptive optimal switching operation for noninterruptible load transfer among distribution feeders and main transformers.","0272-1724;02721724","","10.1109/MPER.2001.4311495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4311495","Load model;binary integer programming;optimal switching operation;temperature sensitivity","Electrical equipment industry;Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Information systems;Load flow analysis;Substations;Switches;Temperature distribution;Temperature sensors;Testing","","","","0","","","","","July 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They try to harness previous experience and intuition in service of the new thing. How is this new thing like something that I already know and understand? Trying to model the new thing on some old thing can be efficient, making it easier to reason about the new thing by using analogies adopted from previous experience. We're in the midst of a huge society-wide change to move record keeping from paper systems to digital ones. In consequence, a vast number of existing rules can and should be rethought and revised.

"4. Semantic indexing and retrieval of video","M. Worring; C. Snoek","University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands","2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","20090123","2008","","","1","1","The semantic gap between the low level information that can be derived from the visual data and the conceptual view the user has of the same data is a major bottleneck in video retrieval systems. It has dictated that solutions to image and video indexing could only be applied in narrow domains using specific concept detectors, e.g., Â¿sunsetÂ¿ or Â¿faceÂ¿. This leads to lexica of at most 10-20 concepts. The use of multimodal indexing, advances in machine learning, and the availability of some large, annotated information sources, e.g., the TRECVID benchmark, has paved the way to increase lexicon size by orders of magnitude (now 100 concepts, in a few years 1,000). This brings it within reach of research in ontology engineering, i.e. creating and maintaining large, typically 10,000+ structured sets of shared concepts. When this goal is reached we could search for videos in our home collection or on the web based on their semantic content, we could develop semantic video editing tools, or develop tools that monitor various video sources and trigger alerts based on semantic events. This tutorial lays the foundation for these exciting new horizons. It will cover basis video analysis techniques and explain the different methods for video indexing. From there it will explore how users can be given interactive access to the data. For both indexing and interactive access TRECVID evaluations will be considered.","1051-4651;10514651","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2175-6; POD:978-1-4244-2174-9","10.1109/ICPR.2008.4760938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760938","","Detectors;Face detection;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Maintenance engineering;Monitoring;Ontologies;Video sharing","indexing;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;video retrieval","TRECVID evaluation;machine learning;multimodal indexing;ontology engineering;semantic Web;semantic video editing tool;video retrieval system","","1","","","","","8-11 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the IoT, the ubiquitous things are assigned with the capability of comprehensive perception, reliable information transmission, and smart processing, in which intelligence becomes a significant feature and should be highlighted. The intelligent IoT enables distributed intelligent devices to play novel roles as smart data acquisition, advanced information extraction, self-adaptive control manipulation, reliable transmission, and intelligent decision support and services. The success of intelligent IoT highly depends on the system architectures, networks and communications, data processing and ubiquitous computing technologies, which support efficient and reliable physical and cyber interconnections. In addition to the handling of huge sensed data, physical infrastructures, interfaces/middleware, and application services are required to support intelligent management and other business-related activities, including clouding computing, big data, semantic web, knowledge coordination, and social computing.

Tsudik","Columbia University","IEEE Security & Privacy","20100726","2010","8","4","16","17","Privacy-preserving sharing of sensitive information (PPSSI) is motivated by the increasing need for entities (organizations or individuals) that don't fully trust each other to share sensitive information. Many types of entities need to collect, analyze, and disseminate data rapidly and accurately, without exposing sensitive information to unauthorized or untrusted parties. Although statistical methods have been used to protect data for decades, they aren't foolproof and generally involve a trusted third party. Recently, the security research community has studied—and, in a few cases, deployed—techniques using secure, multiparty function evaluation, encrypted keywords, and private information retrieval. However, few practical tools and technologies provide data privacy, especially when entities have certain common goals and require (or are mandated) some sharing of sensitive information. To this end, PPSSI technology aims to enable sharing information, without exposing more than the minimum necessary to complete a common task.","1540-7993;15407993","","10.1109/MSP.2010.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523863","confidentiality;information sharing;privacy","Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Data analysis;Data privacy;Data security;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information security;Privacy;Protection;Special issues and sections;Statistical analysis","","","","2","","","","","July-Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The billing data of all service customers are retrieved to derive the daily load profile of the selected Taipower district. To verify the accuracy of the estimated load composition, the simulation results are compared to the actual load profile collected by the SCADA system. The sensitivity analysis of load demand with respect to the temperature change for each customer class is performed by statistic regression according to the actual customer power consumption and temperature data. The load contribution by each customer class is updated by the corresponding temperature sensitivity and integrated together to form the new load profile of a service district with temperature change. To investigate the temperature effect to the distribution system operation, one of the Taipower distribution feeders is selected for computer simulation. The power demand at each load bus of the distribution feeder is calculated by applying the temperature sensitivity and the three-phase load flow analysis is then executed to find the new feeder loading and power loss with the temperature change.","0272-1724;02721724","","10.1109/MPER.2001.4311105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4311105","Load profile;temperature sensitivity;three-phase load flow","Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Load management;Power system simulation;SCADA systems;Sensitivity analysis;Statistical analysis;Statistical distributions;Temperature distribution;Temperature sensors","","","","0","","","","","Oct. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Semantic Web applications are being developed for many aspects of scientific research, from experimental data management, discovery and retrieval, to analytic workflows, hypothesis development and testing, to research publishing and dissemination. This workshop intends to explore the questions that arise as Semantic Web applications are increasingly grounded within the actual lifecycle of scientific research, from observation and hypothesis formulation to publication, dissemination and criticism. We aim to bring together researchers across the disciplines, to discuss the use, development and embedding of these technologies in varied research domains and contexts. We will discuss the actuality of Semantic Web technologies in use and the emergent practices through which they are being developed and deployed. We aim to encourage vigorous discussion around aims, methods, applications and pragmatics. This workshop will look at the theoretical, methodological and pragmatic issues of grounding the development, deployment and evolution of ontologies and applications in Semantic e-Science in practical scientific problems and activity. How do we ground deductive Semantic Web information management and retrieval in the practical conditions of evolving sciences based on experiment, observation and induction? How do we bridge gaps and conflicts in approach between computer scientists developing research tools, and research practitioners using those tools? Is it possible to develop Semantic Web practices in e-Science that deal explicitly with hypothesis formulation, testing, challenge and refinement? Semantic Web applications have the potential to substantially accelerate research. Are all domains of research equally promising for the development of targeted semantic web applications? Are- “semantic” domains defined by particular areas of research, by a particular form of scientific question, by discipline or sub-discipline or by particular aspects or stages of the scientific process? Are there types of enquiry which are intractable to the solutions offered by the Semantic Web, and if so, why? What are the specific challenges of Semantic Web applications in different disciplines, and how might Semantic Web applications shape and be shaped by them? The incorporation of semantic technologies with existing social web practices — “Web 3.0” — promises to change the scientific research, publication and discussion model we now have to a much more fluid, “higher-velocity” model. It also poses many questions for technologists and researchers alike. Can abstract and formal understandings of the underlying ontologies be supplemented or even replaced by more informal social conceptions of ontologies? What are the advantages and disadvantages of top-down or bottom-up development processes? What are best practices regarding user engagement and usability; what are the different roles of stakeholders in the process of development and deployment? What if any changes in scientific practice may be required to exploit the promise of semantic e-Science?","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5947-6; POD:978-1-4244-5946-9","10.1109/ESCIW.2009.5407976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5407976","","Application software;Bridges;Grounding;Information management;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Publishing;Research and development management;Semantic Web;Testing","","","","2","","","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A four-year old online photo sharing website, Flickr, has more than 40 million monthly visitors and 2 billion photos uploaded; in fact, in a single day, a few million photos are uploaded. These developments have spurred enormous interest in digital images and a corresponding demand, both from the public and from industry, for better ways of cataloging, annotating, and accessing these data. This in turn has motivated researchers in pattern analysis and machine intelligence to address these tasks.

The normalized total gradient method is initially used in the system to qualitatively and quantitatively interpret the data from different directions, and the multi-resolution analysis is also innovatively used in the BK inversion in order to lessen the non-uniqueness and unsteadiness.

However, there are some problems: it is difficult to understand collaborations among the agents as a whole, and it is difficult to define the behaviors of agents because they are dynamically influenced by their external context. So, in general, constructions of cooperative distributed applications based on mobile agent systems are considered as very hard and difficult works. In this paper, the concept of RoleEP (Role-based Evolutionary Programming) is proposed in order to alleviate these problems. RoleEP provides a systematic evolutionary programming style. In RoleEP, a field where a group of agents collaborate with each other is regarded as an environment, and a function that an agent assumes in an environment is defined as a role. Descriptions only concerning the collaborations among agents can be abstracted by environments. An object becomes an agent by binding itself with a role that is defined in an environment, and it then acquires the functions needed for collaborating with other agents that exist in the same environment. Distributed applications based on mobile agent systems, which may change their functions dynamically in order to adapt themselves to their external context, can be constructed by synthesizing environments dynamically","","POD:0-7695-0906-1","10.1109/ISPSE.2000.913244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913244","","Collaboration;Collaborative work;Genetic programming;Information retrieval;Internet;Java;Mobile agents;Permission;Topology","distributed programming;evolutionary computation;multi-agent systems","Internet;RoleEP;adaptive applications;agent behavior definition;agent collaborations;cooperative distributed applications;cooperative mobile agent applications;dynamic environment synthesis;external context;object-role binding;role-based evolutionary programming;systematic evolutionary programming style","","5","","26","","","2000","01 Nov 2000-02 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, those MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 coders which exhibit such a functionality produce much more bits than corresponding single layer coders. This bitrate overhead can be reduced by application of spatio-temporal scalability as proposed by the authors. The base layer bitstream corresponds to pictures with reduced both spatial and temporal resolution while the enhancement layer bitstream is used to transmit the information needed to retrieve images with full spatial and temporal resolution. Full compatibility with the MPEG standards is ensured in the base layer where temporal resolution reduction is obtained by B-frame data partitioning, i.e. by placing each second frame (B-frame) in the enhancement layer only. Improved prediction of B-frames in the enhancement layer is proposed in this paper. The idea is to combine temporal forward and backward prediction with spatial interpolation. Experimental results prove a clear improvement of the MPEG-2-compatible scalable coding efficiency for the scheme proposed","","POD:0-7803-5482-6","10.1109/ISCAS.2000.856314","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=856314","","Bit rate;Image resolution;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;MPEG 4 Standard;MPEG standards;Scalability;Spatial resolution;Video codecs;Video coding","code standards;data compression;interpolation;prediction theory;video codecs;video coding","B-frame data partitioning;B-frame prediction;MPEG standards compatibility;MPEG-2-compatible scalable coding efficiency;base layer bitstream;bitrate overhead reduction;enhancement layer bitstream;scalable MPEG video coding;spatial interpolation;spatio-temporal scalability;video codecs","","1","","12","","","2000","28 May 2000-31 May 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While abrupt shot transitions are discontinuities quite easy to detect, the gradual ones are highly masked by and confused with object motion, camera operation, and other disturbing effects. Current approaches to detecting gradual transitions are based on the calculation of several inter-frame distances, and on the compensation and detection of the aforementioned causes of disturbance. This article presents an innovative detection method based on a multi-parameter modeling of the patterns that these transitions produce over a simple inter-frame distance, which opens the possibility of a later multi-dimensional classification of the desired transitions into a single cluster","","POD:0-7695-0595-3","10.1109/IAI.2000.839570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839570","","Cameras;Computational efficiency;Electrical capacitance tomography;Gunshot detection systems;Identity-based encryption;Information retrieval;Materials testing;Multidimensional systems;Read only memory;Roads","feature extraction;image segmentation;image sequences;motion compensation;multidimensional signal processing;pattern clustering;video signal processing","automatic feature extraction;camera operation;compensation;gradual shot transition;indexing;inter-frame distances;multi-dimensional classification;multi-parameter modeling;multidimensional clustering;object motion;patterns;retrieval;shot transition detection;video material","","1","","15","","","2000","02 Apr 2000-04 Apr 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A tree-based vector quantization scheme offers marginally worse performance in a faster, scalable framework. Good results are also reported for music retrieval-by-similarity using the same techniques.

One major drawback in DSM data is the inherent union of object and terrain height. This aggravates image processing tasks like object extraction. It is the aim of this paper to overcome this drawback and solve the problem of extracting borders of tree groups as well as their heights above the ground on the basis of a DSMs of forested areas. The presented approach can be subdivided as follows: first the original DSM is normalized to a preliminary above-ground-model by comparing all pixels to a minimum value in their neighborhood. Non-ground points are identified by thresholding this model. The ground elevation of the non-ground regions is interpolated based on the elevation of the pixels neighboring these regions. Subtracting the resulting DTM from the original DSM yields precise object heights. Finally, a contouring algorithm is applied to retrieve the borders of the tree groups.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-6297-7","10.1109/ICIP.2000.899808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899808","","Data mining;Image processing;Image sensors;Information processing;Information retrieval;Laser modes;Remote sensing;Shape;Space technology;Spatial resolution","edge detection;feature extraction;forestry;interpolation;terrain mapping","DSM;contouring algorithm;high-resolution digital surface models;image processing tasks;interpolation;nonground points;object extraction;object heights;preliminary above-ground-model;remote sensing information processing;spectral reflectances;tree groups","","2","4","5","","","10-13 Sept. 2000","10 Sep 2000-13 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The hidden data should be recoverable even after the host has undergone standard transformations, such as compression. In this paper, we present a source and channel coding framework for data hiding, allowing any tradeoff between the visibility of distortions introduced, the amount of data embedded, and the degree of robustness to noise. The secure data is source coded by vector quantization, and the indices obtained in the process are embedded in the host video using orthogonal transform domain vector perturbations. Transform coefficients of the host are grouped into vectors and perturbed using noise-resilient channel codes derived from multidimensional lattices. The perturbations are constrained by a maximum allowable mean-squared error that can be introduced in the host. Channel-optimized VQ can be used for increased robustness to noise. The generic approach is readily adapted to make retrieval possible for applications where the original host is not available to the retriever. The secure data in our implementations are low spatial and temporal resolution video, and sampled speech, while the host data is QCIF video. The host video with the embedded data is H.263 compressed, before attempting retrieval of the hidden video and speech from the reconstructed video.

Data are analyzed using detailed ground truth measurements available on both sites. The backscattering coefficient is strongly correlated to characteristics of the tree trunk. Signal saturation is not observed up to 900 m<sup>3</sup>/ha. However, the sensitivity to the volume is high in the range of 0-500 m<sup>3</sup>/ha (e.g. 1 to 1.5 dB for 50 m<sup>3</sup> /ha), whereas it is reduced beyond 500 m<sup>3</sup>/ha (<0.5 dB for 50 m<sup>3</sup>/ha). The experimental analysis is supported by theoretical modeling using a coherent backscatter model based on the distorted Born approximation coupled with a tree growth model giving a fine and precise description of the trees at both sites. The modeling results show that the trunk is the main scatterer, but that, when the branch dimensions are not insignificant compared to trunk dimension, branch scattering needs to be accounted for. However, since the two species under study are both coniferous, branch dimensions are relatively small compared to trunk dimension. This explains no significant differences observed in the backscatter behavior between both sites, except for mature stands with low stem density. Finally, the effect of topography is investigated both experimentally, using a digital elevation model, and theoretically with the coherent model. The loss of sensitivity to stem volume due to slope is clearly demonstrated and explained by the decrease of the dihedral trunk-ground interaction as the slope increases","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/36.964972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=964972","","Airborne radar;Approximation methods;Backscatter;Biomass;Coupled mode analysis;Data analysis;Information retrieval;Radar imaging;Radar scattering;Surfaces","VHF radio propagation;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","CARABAS;Landes forest;Lozere forest;VHF SAR data;airborne imaging radar;backscattering coefficient;branch scattering;coherent backscatter model;coniferous forest;digital elevation model;dihedral trunk-ground interaction;distorted Born approximation;forest biomass;forest stem volume retrieval;ground truth measurements;pine plantation forests;southern France;tree growth model;tree trunk;trunk dimension","","30","2","27","","","Nov 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the essence of template matching, the algorithm is capable of comparing the similarity among different faces, which makes it suitable for tracking the same face that occur at disjointed temporal locations in video. While the proposed face detection method provides comparable accuracy as the neural network based approach, it is much faster","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-6297-7","10.1109/ICIP.2000.900890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=900890","","Data security;Dynamic programming;Face detection;Face recognition;Humans;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Neural networks;Surveillance;Testing","dynamic programming;face recognition;image matching;image sequences;iterative methods;object detection;tracking;video signal processing","dynamic programming;face detection algorithm;face recognition;face similarity;face tracking;fast template matching;frontal face;iterative dynamic programming;neural network based approach;nonfrontal faces tracking;online adapted face models;video content analysis;video disjointed temporal locations;video sequence","","17","5","8","","","2000","10 Sep 2000-13 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two key problems in color indexing are: (1) determination of the color space, and (2) finding the best distance measure. Most of the attention from the research literature has been focussed on the color model with little or no consideration of the noise models. By focusing on the noise model, we show how to find a distance measure which is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the similarity probability. Our results include experiments in color based retrieval and object recognition. Furthermore, we implement and test several promising algorithms from the research literature as benchmarks","","POD:0-7803-6536-4","10.1109/ICME.2000.869603","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869603","","Colored noise;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Noise measurement;Spatial databases;Testing","content-based retrieval;distance measurement;image colour analysis;object recognition;optical noise","color based recognition;color based retrieval;color indexing;color space;content based retrieval;distance measure;noise models;object recognition;retrieval method;similarity probability","","0","","8","","","2000","30 Jul 2000-02 Aug 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper explores the authors' solution that aims to provide efficient retrieval of medical imaging. Depending on the user, the same image can be described through different views. In essence, an image can be described on the basis of either low-level properties, such as texture or color; context, such as date of acquisition or author; or semantic content, such as real-world objects and relations. The authors' approach consists of providing a global description solution capable of integrating different dimensions (or views) of a medical image. The description problem of medical images during both storage and retrieval processes is studied. Few proposed solutions take into consideration the heterogeneity of user competence (physician, researcher, student, etc.) and the necessity of a high expressive power for medical imaging description. For example, spatial content in terms of relationships in surgical or radiation therapy of brain tumors is very decisive because the location of a tumor has profound implications on a therapeutic decision. Visual solutions are recommended and are the most appropriated for non computer-scientist users. However, current visual languages suffer from several problems, especially ambiguities generated by the user and/or the system at different levels of image description, imprecision and no respect of the integrity of spatial relations. This framework exposes the authors' solution showing how this problematic can be resolved. An implementation has been realized to prove their proposition","","POD:0-7695-0862-6","10.1109/BIBE.2000.889620","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=889620","","Biomedical imaging;Hospitals;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Management information systems;Neoplasms;Picture archiving and communication systems;Spatial resolution;X-rays","brain;medical image processing;tumours","acquisition date;ambiguity resolving;brain tumors;context;efficient retrieval;low-level properties;medical diagnostic imaging;medical image global description;spatial relations;texture;user competence","","2","","40","","","2000","08 Nov 2000-10 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
