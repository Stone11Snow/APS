By laying out data structures in memory in a more cache-conscious fashion, removing branches from the execution flow using a technique called predication, and micro-batching predictions using a technique called vectorization, we are able to better exploit modern processor architectures.

Exact and accurate knowledge in the text documents needed for the user to find what they require. Many data mining methods are used to mine useful patterns from text documents. However, using and updating these discovered patterns is still an open research issue. Many term based methods are suggested, but a disadvantage with these methods is that they suffer from the problem of synonymy and polysemy. To overcome these disadvantages pattern mining methods are recommended. Pattern mining methods are not proven to be better than term based methods because of low frequency and pattern misinterpretation problem. Here an effective pattern discovery technique is given which applies a pattern co-occurrence matrix to clean close sequential patterns. Process of pattern deploying is applied with the co-occurrence weight and absolute support (PDCS) as deploying approach to overcome pattern misinterpretation problems and pattern evolving to overcome low frequency problem. It also applies a pattern co-occurrence matrix to clean close sequential patterns. This improves performance by using and updating discovered patterns and finding interesting and relevant information.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3485-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-3486-7; POD:978-1-4799-3487-4","10.1109/CNSC.2014.6906647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906647","Information Retrieval;Pattern Deploying;Pattern Evolving","Carbon dioxide;Data mining;Equations;Noise measurement;Phase change materials;Taxonomy;Training","data mining;pattern classification;text analysis","PDCS deploying approach;data mining methods;knowledge discovery;pattern cooccurrence matrix;pattern discovery technique;pattern mining methods;pattern misinterpretation problems;text documents;text mining","","0","","15","","","19-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on this aspect, i.e. given the polyphonic audio along with its multiple F0 contours, the proposed system clusters them so as to decide `which instrument played when.' For the task of identifying the instrument or singers in the polyphonic audio, there are many supervised methods available. But many times individual source audio is not available for training. To address this problem, this paper proposes novel schemes using semi-supervised as well as unsupervised approach to source clustering. The proposed theoretical framework is based on auditory perception theory and is implemented using various tools like probabilistic latent component analysis and graph clustering, while taking into account various perceptual cues for characterizing a source. Experiments have been carried out over a wide variety of datasets - ranging from vocal to instrumental as well as from synthetic to real world music. The proposed scheme significantly outperforms a state of the art unsupervised scheme, which does not make use of the given F0 contours. The proposed semi-supervised approach also performs better than another semi-supervised scheme, which makes use of the given F0 information, in terms of computations as well as accuracy.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2014.2313404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6777516","Acoustic scene analysis;music information retrieval;polyphonic instrument identification","Feature extraction;Harmonic analysis;IEEE transactions;Indexes;Instruments;Speech;Speech processing","acoustic signal processing;audio signal processing;graph theory;information retrieval;music;musical instruments;pattern clustering;probability;statistical analysis;unsupervised learning","acoustic scene analysis;auditory perception theory;graph clustering;multiF0 contours;music information retrieval;music transcription;musical source clustering;musical source identification;musical source separation;polyphonic audio;polyphonic instrument identification;probabilistic latent component analysis;semi-supervised approach;supervised methods;unsupervised approach","","1","","35","","20140324","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In proposed method, the Markov process is assumed on state transition, and time-varying acoustic feature is represented by three Dirichlet processes (DP) that are emitted by the each state. In order to express the generative process, the sticky hidden Markov model (HMM) with DP emission is employed. This modeling allows us to automatically estimate the state transition while avoiding the model selection problem by assuming countably infinite of possible acoustic feature in musical notes.

This paper extends the application of the haze optimized transform (HOT) from haze mapping to include object-oriented detection of clouds and cloud shadows. An integrated processing chain encompassing these tasks has been implemented and successfully applied to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Multispectral Scanner imagery covering a variety of land covers and landscapes. The results confirm that the HOT-based method for cloud shadow detection is robust and effective. Cloud shadows have been identified and extracted with overall accuracy of about 95.3%. Clear-sky dark pixels (e.g., small lakes) are well separated from cumulus cloud shadow pixels. The spatial distribution of HOT response in a given cloud patch can be used to estimate the extent and variation of incoming visible radiation reduction in its corresponding shadow patch. This information, in turn, has been used to apply a radiometric gain to compensate for the shadowing effect on the land. The HOT response has been tested for radiometric characterization of cloud shadows and subsequent shadow illumination compensation.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2290237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747977","Image processing;information retrieval;terrain mapping","Clouds;Earth;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Radiometry;Remote sensing;Satellites","artificial satellites;clouds;geophysical image processing;image scanners;object detection;radiometry;terrain mapping;transforms","HOT;clear-sky dark pixel;cloud shadow detection;cumulus cloud shadow pixel;ground surface condition;haze mapping;haze optimized transformation;lake;landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus;low-reflectance object illumination;multispectral scanner imagery;object-based detection;object-oriented detection;radiometric characterization;satellite imagery;spatial distribution;subsequent shadow illumination compensation;terrain mapping;visible radiation reduction","","4","","26","","20140225","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While using a standard pulse detection technique, for octave error correction, we exploit a simple relationship between a single global feature, average spectral novelty, and listener perception of musical tempo.

However, no systematic assessment has been done on the accuracy of social tags and derived semantic models at capturing mood information in music. We propose a novel technique called Affective Circumplex Transformation (ACT) for representing the moods of music tracks in an interpretable and robust fashion based on semantic computing of social tags and research in emotion modeling. We validate the technique by predicting listener ratings of moods in music tracks, and compare the results to prediction with the Vector Space Model (VSM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The results show that ACT consistently outperforms the baseline techniques, and its performance is robust against a low number of track-level mood tags.

One example is sketch-based retrieval, i.e., the search for (multimedia) objects on the basis of sketches as query input. So far, work has focused mainly on sketch-based image retrieval. However, more and more application domains also benefit from sketches as query input for searching in video collections. Enabling spatial search in videos, in the form of sketch-based motion queries, is increasingly demanded by coaches and analysts in team sports as a novel and innovative tool for game analysis. Even though game analysis is already a major activity in this domain, it is still mostly based on manual selection of video sequences. In this paper, we present Sport Sense, a first approach to enabling intuitive and efficient video retrieval using sketch-based motion queries. This is accomplished by using videos of games in team sports, together with an overlay of meta data that incorporates spatio-temporal information about various events. Sport Sense exploits spatio-temporal databases to store, index, and retrieve the tracked information at interactive response times. Moreover, it provides first intuitive user input interfaces for sketches representing motion paths. A particular challenge is to convert the users' sketches into spatial queries and to execute these queries in a flexible way that allows for some controlled deviation between the sketched path and the actual movement of the players and/or the ball. The evaluation results of Sport Sense show that this approach to sketch-based retrieval in sports videos is both very effective and efficient.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-5140-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-2171-3; POD:978-1-4799-4655-6","10.1109/ISM.2013.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746812","content-based information retrieval;motion queries;query-by-sketch;video search","Cameras;Data mining;Games;Indexes;Spatial databases;Tracking;Videos","image sequences;user interfaces;video retrieval","Sport Sense;game analysis;human-computer interaction;pen-based user interfaces;sketch-based image retrieval;sketch-based motion queries;spatio-temporal databases;spatio-temporal information;sports videos;video collections;video retrieval;video sequences","","0","","20","","","9-11 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through several user studies, we compared commentary using SCoReS to three other types of commentary and show that SCoReS adds significantly to the broadcast across several enjoyment metrics. We also collected interview data from professional sports commentators who positively evaluated a demonstration of the system. We conclude that SCoReS can be a useful broadcast tool, effective at selecting stories that add to the enjoyment and watchability of sports.

In this paper, we propose a Web service discovery approach independent of the description model that tries to manage with the heterogeneity found in semantic service description frameworks. This proposed approach uses the principals from text mining, measures of semantic relatedness and information retrieval where the semantic information of the services is integrated with the syntactic service profiles to give hybrid service vectors.

A worker's document referencing behavior can be modeled as a knowledge flow (KF) to represent the evolution of his/her information needs over time. However, the information needs of workers and groups may change over time. Additionally, most traditional recommendation methods which provide personalized recommendations do not consider workers' KFs, or the information needs of the majority of workers in a group to recommend task knowledge. In this work, the group-based collaborative filtering (GCF) method which integrates the KF mining method is proposed to actively provide task-related documents for groups.

Many algorithms for automatically analyzing the structure of recorded music assume that a large change in one or another musical feature suggests a section boundary. However, this assumption has not been tested: while our understanding of how listeners segment melodies has advanced greatly in the past decades, little is known about how this process works with more complex, full-textured pieces of music, or how stable this process is across genres. Knowing how these factors affect how boundaries are perceived will help researchers to judge the viability of algorithmic approaches with different corpora of music. We present a statistical analysis of a large corpus of recordings whose formal structure was annotated by expert listeners. We find that the acoustic properties of boundaries in these recordings corroborate findings of previous perceptual experiments. Nearly all boundaries correspond to peaks in novelty functions, which measure the rate of change of a musical feature at a particular time scale. Moreover, most of these boundaries match peaks in novelty for several features at several time scales. We observe that the boundary-novelty relationship can vary with listener, time scale, genre, and musical feature. Finally, we show that a boundary profile derived from a collection of novelty functions correlates with the estimated salience of boundaries indicated by listeners.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2014.2310706","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6762890","Boundaries;corpus analysis;music analysis;music information retrieval","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Communities;Educational institutions;Electrical engineering;Music;Predictive models","audio signal processing;data mining;statistical analysis","acoustic properties;audio properties;data mining tasks;information retrieval;music;music indexing;musical feature;perceived boundaries;recordings;section boundary;statistical analysis","","1","","28","","20140311","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The approach includes the use of a log linear model, a method for training the model, and an algorithm for generating the top k candidates, whether there is or is not a predefined dictionary. The log linear model is defined as a conditional probability distribution of an output string and a rule set for the transformation conditioned on an input string. The learning method employs maximum likelihood estimation for parameter estimation. The string generation algorithm based on pruning is guaranteed to generate the optimal top k candidates. The proposed method is applied to correction of spelling errors in queries as well as reformulation of queries in web search. Experimental results on large scale data show that the proposed approach is very accurate and efficient improving upon existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency in different settings.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6412665","Computing Methodologies;Document and Text Editing;Document and Text Processing;Information Search and Retrieval;Information Storage and Retrieval;Information Technology and Systems;Log Linear Model;Query formulation;Spelling;String Transformation;String transformation;log linear model;query reformulation;spelling error correction","Accuracy;Data mining;Dictionaries;Error correction;Indexes;Probabilistic logic;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation;natural language processing;parameter estimation;probability;query processing","Web search queries;bioinformatics;conditional probability distribution;data mining;information retrieval;input string;learning method;maximum likelihood estimation;natural language processing;output strings;parameter estimation;probabilistic approach;string generation algorithm;string transformation","","1","","31","","20130115","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we extend this idea towards presenting a single, standalone beat tracking solution which can exploit the benefit of mutual agreement without the need to run multiple separate beat tracking algorithms.

This paper implements a method for TID based on Brace well's keywords similarity algorithm and the top-n keywords selection for Indonesian news documents. The top-n method is utilized to improve Brace well's performance within Indonesian corpus, and to reduce the dimension of dataset during training. The combination is aimed to reduce the heavy computation problem and to explore the possibility of a new emerging topic which possibly has to be created. The method consists of two stages: training and classification. It studies the keywords of the training dataset then calculates the similarity between testing and training articles' keywords.

The location server desires to have some control over its data, since the data is its asset. We propose a major enhancement upon previous solutions by introducing a two stage approach, where the first step is based on Oblivious Transfer and the second step is based on Private Information Retrieval, to achieve a secure solution for both parties. The solution we present is efficient and practical in many scenarios. We implement our solution on a desktop machine and a mobile device to assess the efficiency of our protocol. We also introduce a security model and analyse the security in the context of our protocol. Finally, we highlight a security weakness of our previous work and present a solution to overcome it.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.87","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6520849","Location based query;Oblivious transfer;Private information retrieval;Private query;oblivious transfer;private information retrieval;private query","Databases;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Privacy;Protocols;Security;Servers","data protection;mobile computing;query processing","POIs;content-protecting location based query;desktop machine;location data;location server;mobile device;oblivious transfer;point of interest;privacy-preserving;private information retrieval;protocol;security model;two stage approach","","11","","33","","20130527","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using feature learning and deep architectures instead, thus reducing the required engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge. However, this new approach typically still relies on mid-level representations of music audio, e.g. spectrograms, instead of raw audio signals. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to apply feature learning directly to raw audio signals. We train convolutional neural networks using both approaches and compare their performance on an automatic tagging task.

Two characteristics of natural language queries which hinder the performance of query expansion for information retrieval are query length and structure. The varying lengths of a query translate to the number of core concepts that may exist and the possibility of there being multiple query intents embedded within a single query. On the other hand, the structure of queries reveals the linguistic properties which allows for the determination of whether they take the form of well-formed sentences or are simply bags-of-words which in the strictest sense are a series of words with no obvious relations amongst them. Whilst query lengths are easily assessed, we propose a two-level automated classification technique consisting of linguistics based and statistical processing for query structure classification.

Everyday, thousands of users online treated by many kinds of advertisement, but not all of them were eye-catching. This phenomenon is playing an important role related to the interest of web users who will click on the advertisement. The development of computational advertising in Indonesia grew fastly, especially in news portal online. However, there were still many problems such as the sameness display ads on all topic in some news topic and the irrelevance between the advertisement with the news topic (for example: the stationary advertisement on the sport news). Consequently, the advertisement can not attract the attention of web users because it does not fit with the habits and intentions of visitors.

The extracted features were used as observed data, and mixing weights of multiple topics were estimated by LDA. Finally, the semantics of each topic were visualized by using a word-cloud-based approach. Experimental results for a singer identification task using 36 songs sung by 12 singers showed that our method achieved a mean reciprocal rank of 0.86.

A semantic system based on speech transcripts is augmented with information from full-length text articles. Posterior probabilities extracted from the articles are used to regularize their transcription counterparts. This paper makes three important contributions. First, we introduce a framework for polarity analysis of sentiments that can accommodate combinations of different modalities capable of dealing with the absence of any modality.

The technique demonstrates a number of advantages over alternative methods for displaying and exploring geo-referenced search results and spatio-temporal data. Firstly, cluster summaries can be presented in a manner that makes them easy to read and scan. Listing representative events from each cluster also helps the process of discovery by preserving the diversity of results. Also, clicking on visual representations of geo-temporal clusters provides a quick and intuitive way to navigate across space and time simultaneously.

In this study, we present a novel one-shot Post-rank Optimization (POP) method, which allows a user to quickly refine their search by either ""one-shot"" or a couple of sparse negative selections during a re-identification process. We conduct systematic behavioural studies to understand user's searching behaviour and show that the proposed method allows correct re-identification to converge 2.6 times faster than the conventional exhaustive search. Importantly, through extensive evaluations we demonstrate that the method is capable of achieving significant improvement over the state-of-the-art distance metric learning based ranking models, even with just ""one shot"" feedback optimisation, by as much as over 30% performance improvement for rank 1 re-identification on the VIPeR and i-LIDS datasets.","1550-5499;15505499","Electronic:978-1-4799-2840-8; POD:978-1-4799-2841-5; USB:978-1-4799-2839-2","10.1109/ICCV.2013.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6751164","human computer interaction;information retrieval;manifold;person re-identification;ranking;visual surveillance","Cameras;Context;Optimization;Probes;Training;Vegetation;Visualization","image recognition;optimisation","POP method;VIPeR dataset;error-prone post-rank visual search;exhaustive human eyeballing;i-LIDS dataset;one shot feedback optimisation;one-shot post-rank optimization method;performance improvement;person reidentification post-rank optimisation;ranking performance;searching behaviour;sparse negative selections;state-of-the-art distance metric learning;systematic behavioural study;time-consuming post rank visual search;visual ambiguity;visual disparity","","21","","28","","","1-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an approach for web service discovery is proposed which uses a lexical semantic network constructed from the web snippets as a knowledge base for the calculation of semantic similarity between the service profiles. Our approach takes into account the text descriptions and involves mapping of service profiles to a category based dimension vector by using the notion of semantic similarity which is further merged with the IR based techniques of weight generation and is used for calculating the semantic degree of similarity between the services. We present results that we obtained by applying the approach on set of 106 OWL-S service profiles.

These algorithms typically utilize two fundamental properties of musical rhythm: some features of the audio signal are self-similar at periods related to the underlying rhythmic structure, and rhythmic events tend to be spaced regularly in time. We present a streamlined tempo estimation method ( stem) that distills ideas from previous work by reducing the number of steps, parameters, and modeling assumptions while retaining good accuracy. This method is designed for music with a constant or near-constant tempo. The proposed method either outperforms or has similar performance to many existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Self-similarity is captured through autocorrelation of the onset strength signal (OSS), and time regularity is captured through cross-correlation of the OSS with regularly spaced pulses. Our findings are supported by the most comprehensive evaluation of tempo estimation algorithms to date in terms of the number of datasets and tracks considered. During the process we have also corrected ground truth annotations for the datasets considered.

Our method is based on measuring the semantic similarity of the thematic graph created from a text document and the ontology sub-graphs resulting from the projection of the defined contexts. The domain ontology effectively becomes the classifier, where classification topics are expressed using the defined ontological contexts. In contrast to the traditional supervised categorization methods, the proposed method does not require a training set of documents. More importantly, our approach allows dynamically changing the classification topics without retraining of the classifier. In our experiments, we used the English language Wikipedia converted to an RDF ontology to categorize a corpus of current Web news documents into selection of topics of interest.

Previous work has shown that word senses carry potentially useful information for sentiment analysis. However due to limitations in the existing methods to assign senses to words in open-domain texts, this word sense based approach has not demonstrated significant advantages over the traditional term-based approaches. Also most sentiment lexicons consider limited polarity values (usually 2 or 3), therefore may convey very little information for distinguishing between a sentence that is positive and one that is negative. This paper proposes to address these limitations by making use of term-based sentiment lexicons, by increasing the number of possible polarity values considered in lexicons, and by processing the sentences for local negation. Finally we propose a novel sentiment representation generated by merging the word features with the developed sentiment features in a single sequence. Our evaluations show that and our proposed improvements effectively increased the quality of the sentiment representations.

We compared the influence of this approach on the tagging and querying behaviour of users, with respect to usability, efficiency, and user experience, between the standard Flickr tagging and querying method and the one used in SemioTag. Our results show that semiotic tagging is considered more tedious and takes about twice the time as standard tagging. However, subjects produced a larger number of tags with semiotic tagging. Finally, querying with semiotic tags is not considered more cumbersome than querying using standard tags. Subjects stated that semiotic-based search provides more reasonable results than search based on standard tagging because it provided more control on the query. Semiotic search turned out to be faster. Overall, the findings clearly indicate to further investigate in the direction of semiotic tagging. We anticipate application of semiotics for particular types of human-centered IR such as explorative search.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4003-5; POD:978-1-4799-4004-2","10.1109/ICSC.2014.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881995","information retrieval;semiotic tagging;user study","Accuracy;Context;Indexes;Semantics;Standards;Tagging","image classification;image retrieval","Flickr querying method;Flickr tagging method;SemioTag approach;classification structures;explorative search;human-centered IR;image annotation;image retrieval;image search;semiotic sign;semiotic tagging;social media-oriented repositories;tags semantics;user experience;user querying behaviour;user tagging behavior","","0","","19","","","16-18 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many widely adopted scientific data search engines continue to be mainly based on text semantics. However, it is not uncommon in scientific big data applications to face collected data that do not possess text information. In this scenario, search engines fail to retrieve potentially relevant data. For instance, even though Pangaea, a digital data library and a publisher for earth system science, contains more than 400,000 datasets, more than 98% lack sufficient text information. In this work, we propose a novel pseudo relevance feedback method based on spatio-temporal and text (STT) information for scientific big data: STT-PRF. Although STT-PRF may simultaneously use STT information, we show that the missing values in space, time or/and the text are handled efficiently. STT-PRF is especially robust even without text information. We tested our STT-PRF method using the Pangaea repository on our Cross-DB Search Platform, which is a search engine for scientific big data based on various latent correlations.

This enables users to share or browse the resources or retrieve them in future. Collaborative Tagging systems or folksonomies have the potential to become an integral part of Web 2.0. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a powerful tool commonly used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and with the Semantic Web. FCA has been used in online document and resource management systems. In this case the resources are treated as objects and tags as attributes. FCA groups these resources hierarchically in a lattice structure thereby providing multiple dimensions to information retrieval. Objects are grouped with a set of attributes common to all of them. These groups are called concepts and are the building blocks of FCA lattices. A system is discussed that models objects and their tags with Formal Concept Analysis. A user's query for objects with certain attributes can be mapped to a particular concept. The objects of this concept can be returned as results. Further related and relevant results can be provided by finding the concepts most similar to the result concept and returning their objects to the user as well. Thus, an information retrieval system can be implemented. Further automation can be investigated with machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1024-3; POD:978-1-4799-1023-6","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844171","Collaborative tagging;Formal Concept Analysis;folksonomy;information retrieval","Collaboration;Formal concept analysis;Lattices;Search problems;Semantics;Tagging","Internet;formal concept analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing","FCA;Web 2.0;artificial intelligence techniques;collaborative tagging system;data mining;formal concept analysis;information retrieval system;lattice structure;machine learning;online document;resource annotation;resource management systems;semantic Web;user query","","0","","20","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we investigate two different information folksonomy sources for the movie domain namely: keywords and tags, the first of which is user annotated and expert monitored whereas the latter is non-monitored.

Comparing to conventional audio descriptors, audio words offer greater fexibility in capturing the nuance of music signals, in that each codeword can be viewed as a quantization of the music universe and that the quantization goes finer as the size of the dictionary (i.e., audio codebook) increases. In practice, however, the high computational cost of codeword assignment might discourage the use of a large dictionary. This paper presents two modifications of a LASSO screening technique developed in the compressive sensing field to speed up the codeword assignment process. The first modification exploits the repetitive nature of music signals, whereas the second one relaxes a screening constraint that is specific to reconstruction but not for classifcation. Our experiments show that the proposed method enables the use of a dictionary of 10,000 codewords with runtime close to the case of using a dictionary of 1,000 codewords. Moreover, using the larger dictionary significantly improves the mean average precision (MAP) from 0.219 to 0.246 for tagging thousands of tracks with 147 possible genre tags.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4799-2893-4; POD:978-1-4799-2894-1; USB:978-1-4799-2892-7","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854596","LASSO screening;Sparse coding;feature learning;genre classifcation;music information retrieval","Accuracy;Dictionaries;Encoding;Multiple signal classification;Music;Support vector machines;Tagging","audio coding;compressed sensing;music;signal classification","LASSO screening technique;audio codebook;audio codeword;audio word-based music classification;compressive sensing field;large scale dictionary;modified lasso screening;music signal;music universe quantization","","3","","25","","","4-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, in-time augmentation of D-matrix through the discovery of new symptoms and failure modes observed for the first time is a challenging task. Here, we describe an ontology-based text mining method for automatically constructing and updating a D-matrix by mining hundreds of thousands of repair verbatim (typically written in unstructured text) collected during the diagnosis episodes. In our approach, we first construct the fault diagnosis ontology consisting of concepts and relationships commonly observed in the fault diagnosis domain. Next, we employ the text mining algorithms that make use of this ontology to identify the necessary artifacts, such as parts, symptoms, failure modes, and their dependencies from the unstructured repair verbatim text.

Most systems focused on recommendation accuracy, predicting likable items for each user. Such methods tend to generate popular and safe recommendations, but fail to introduce users to potentially risky, yet novel items that could help in increasing the variety of items consumed by the users. This is known as popularity bias, which is predominant in methods that adopt collaborative filtering. Recently, however, recommenders have started to improve their methods to generate lists that encompass diverse items that are both accurate and novel through specific novelty-driven algorithms or hybrid recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a recommender system that uses the concepts of Experts to find both novel and relevant recommendations. By analyzing the ratings of the users, the algorithm promotes special Experts from the user population to create novel recommendations for a target user. Thus, different users are promoted dynamically to Experts depending on who the recommendations are for. The system used data collected from Last.fm and was evaluated with several metrics. Results show that the proposed system outperforms matrix factorization methods in finding novel items and performs on par in finding simultaneously novel and relevant items.

The algorithms were evaluated on a task in which 360 folk songs were classified into tune families using normalized compression distance, a 1-nn classifier and leave-one-out cross-validation. COSIATEC achieved a success rate of 84% on this task, compared with a success rate of 13% for a general-purpose compressor. Variants of the algorithms incorporating modifications that have been suggested in the literature were also run on the task and the results were compared.","2327-1671;23271671","Electronic:978-1-4799-3696-0; POD:978-1-4799-3697-7","10.1109/CIP.2014.6844503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844503","Compression;Machine learning;Music analysis;Music information retrieval;Pattern discovery","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Complexity theory;Compression algorithms;Encoding;Multiple signal classification;Vectors","computational complexity;data compression;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);music;pattern classification","1-NN classifier;1-nearest-neighbour classifier;COSIATEC compression algorithms;Kolmogorov complexity theory;SIATECCOMPRESS compression algorithms;compressed encoding generation;compression-based geometric pattern discovery;folk songs;general-purpose compressor;leave-one-out cross-validation;machine learning;music information retrieval;musical analysis;musical corpora;musical objects;normalized compression distance;point-set representations","","1","","10","","","26-28 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In FIR, we first propose two features named Available Space (AS) and Image Extension (IE) as two indicators to represent the relationships between AOI and RS-Image. Then, we mine the fuzzy association rules between the proposed indicators and user rating score. Finally, we propose two fuzzy inference strategies named FIR with Weight<sub>area</sub> (FIR_area) and FIR with Weight<sub>all</sub>(FIR_all) to rank and recommend the relevant RS-Images to users. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on RS-Image recommendation that considers the issues of feature extraction and fuzzy rule mining, simultaneously.

The importance of Big Data is not about how large it is, but about what information you can get from analyzing these data. Such analysis would help many businesses on making smarter decisions, and provide time and cost reduction. Therefore, to make such analysis, you will definitely need to search the large files on Big Data. Big Data is such a construction where sequential search is prohibitively inefficient, in terms of time and energy. Therefore, any new technique that allows very efficient search in very large files is highly demanded. The paper presents an innovative approach for efficient searching with fuzzy criteria in very large information systems(Big Data). Organization of efficient access to a large amount of information by an ""approximate"" or ""fuzzy"" indication is a rather complicated Computer Science problem. Usually, the solution of this problem relies on a brute force approach, which results in sequential look-up of the file. In many cases, this substantially undermines system performance. The suggested technique in this paper uses different approach based on the Pigeonhole Principle. It searches binary strings that match the given request approximately. It substantially reduces the sequential search operations and works extremely efficiently from several orders of magnitude including speed, cost and energy. This paper presents a complex developed scheme for the suggested approach using a new data structure, called FuzzyFind Dictionary. The developed scheme provides more accuracy than the basic utilization of the suggested method. It also, works much faster than the sequential search.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4321-0; POD:978-1-4799-4320-3","10.1109/COM.Geo.2014.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910125","Algorithms and Data Structure;Approximate search;Big Data;Information Retrieval;Pigeonhole Principle","Big data;Dictionaries;Hamming distance;Indexing;Organizations;Vectors","Big Data;Internet;data structures","FuzzyFind dictionary;Internet;big data;binary strings;brute force approach;computer science problem;cost reduction;data structure;exponential growth;fuzzy criteria;pigeonhole principle;searching very large files;sequential search operations;very large information systems","","3","","14","","","4-6 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, a cross-domain recommender system has emerged to assist users in finding relevant information from the target domain given the initial information from the source domain. However, in the area of citation recommendation, mapping terms across different domains could be problematic due to the term mismatch. In this paper, we propose a cross-domain citation recommendation framework to suggest relevant research publications given a patent as the source domain. Two main approaches are implemented and compared in this study. The first is a baseline approach which is based on simple keyword mapping technique. The second approach, Co-Citation Selection (CCS), is based on the collaborative filtering in which neighboring papers is selected and weighted into publication citation prediction. To compare between two approaches, we adopt the Cosine, Jaccard, and KL-Divergence as the similarity measurement. The evaluation results are reported in terms of mean precision, recall, F-measure, and reciprocal rank. The best improvement of 22.6% in mean reciprocal rank was achieved with the Jaccard similarity.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2993-1; POD:978-1-4799-2994-8; USB:978-1-4799-2992-4","10.1109/ECTICon.2014.6839810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6839810","citation recommendation;collaborative filtering;cross-domain recommendation;information retrieval;ranking measurement component;similarity calculation","Collaboration;Data mining;Databases;Motion pictures;Patents;Recommender systems","citation analysis;collaborative filtering;pattern matching;recommender systems;statistical analysis","CCS;Cosine;F-measure;Jaccard similarity;KL-divergence;co-citation selection;collaborative filtering;cross-domain citation recommendation;cross-domain recommender system;keyword mapping technique;mean precision;mean reciprocal rank;patent;publication citation prediction;recall;research publications;similarity measurement;source domain;term mismatch;terms mapping","","0","","16","","","14-17 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed strategy builds a multimodal latent space representation where both visual content and annotations are simultaneously mapped. The hypothesis behind the method is that such a latent space yields better results when built from multiple data modalities. The semantic embedding is learned using matrix factorization through stochastic gradient descent, which makes it suitable to deal with large-scale collections. The method is evaluated on a large-scale human action video dataset with three modalities corresponding to action labels, action attributes and visual features. The evaluation is based on a query-by-example strategy, where a sample video is used as input to the system. A retrieved video is considered relevant if it contains an instance of the same human action present in the query. Experimental results show that the learned multimodal latent semantic representation produces improved performance when compared with an exclusively visual representation.","1949-3983;19493983","Electronic:978-1-4799-3990-9; POD:978-1-4799-3991-6; USB:978-1-4799-3989-3","10.1109/CBMI.2014.6849823","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849823","Matrix factorization;human actions;information retrieval;latent space;multimodal data;query by example;video processing","Histograms;Indexing;Semantics;Training;Trajectory;Visualization","gradient methods;image representation;indexing;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;query processing;video signal processing","action attributes;action labels;annotations;data modalities;human action video dataset;human action video indexing;latent space;matrix factorization;multimodal latent semantic representation;multimodal latent space representation;online multimodal matrix factorization;query-by-example strategy;semantic embedding;stochastic gradient descent;visual content;visual features;visual representation","","1","","21","","","18-20 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web Search engines are used to find the desired information on the World Wide Web. Whenever a user query is inputted, searching is performed through that database. The size of repository of search engine is not enough to accommodate every page available on the web. So it is desired that only the most relevant pages must be stored in the database. So, to store those most relevant pages from the World Wide Web, a better approach has to be followed. The software that traverses web for getting the relevant pages is called ""Crawlers"" or ""Spiders"". A specialized crawler called focused crawler traverses the web and selects the relevant pages to a defined topic rather than to explore all the regions of the web page. The crawler does not collect all the web pages, but retrieves only the relevant pages out of all. So the major problem is how to retrieve the relevant and quality web pages. To address this problem, in this paper, we have designed and implemented an algorithm which partitions the web pages on the basis of headings into content blocks and then calculates the relevancy of each partitioned block in web page. Then the page relevancy is calculated by sum of all block relevancy scores in one page. It also calculates the URL score and identifies whether the URL is relevant to a topic or not On the basis of headings, there is an appropriate division of pages into blocks because a complete block comprises of the heading, content, images, links, tables and sub tables of a particular block only.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2102-7; POD:978-1-4799-2104-1","10.1109/ICESC.2014.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745405","Information Retrieval;Web crawling algorithms;focused crawling algorithm;page rank;search engine","Crawlers;Databases;HTML;Ontologies;Search engines;Web pages","Web sites;query processing;search engines","HTMl;URL score;WWW;Web pages;Web search engines;World Wide Web;content block;content block segmentation;database;focused Web crawling;focused crawler","","0","","22","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For every candidate part, we compute character energy based on our observation that each character stroke forms two edges with high similarities in length, curvature, and orientation. For every candidate link, we compute link energy based on the similarities in color, size, stroke width, and spacing between characters that are aligned along a particular direction. For every candidate text unit, we combine character and link energies to compute text unit energy which measures the likelihood that the candidate is a text object.

One important aspect to define music similarity measure is chord progression. In this paper, we present an approach to extract chord progressions from song segmentation in chord sheet music documents. This approach uses signature files to encode chords information with preserved musical data. Then, we propose a novel model for chord sheet music similarity without beats information which composes of three computation levels: (1) chord similarity, (2) sequence similarity, and (3) music similarity. In addition, we improve efficiency by removing duplicated parts. For the evaluation, we set an experiment to compare our music similarity model with others. The results indicated that music similarity based on sequences of chords obtained higher precision than chord classification based on the frequencies of chords. Furthermore, our model can sustain effectiveness even if beats information are unknown. We found that segmentation of chord progression can be another important aspect of musical similarity.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3723-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-3724-0; POD:978-1-4799-3725-7","10.1109/DICTAP.2014.6821675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821675","Chord sheet music;Information retrieval;Music similarity;Signature files","Arrays;Computational modeling;Context;Data mining;Indexes;Information retrieval;Transforms","information retrieval;music","Web sites;beats information;chord classification;chord progression extraction;chord sheet music documents;chord similarity;music classification;music documents retrieval system;music repositories;music similarity measure;musical data;musical similarity;printable sheet format;sequence similarity;song segmentation analysis","","1","1","15","","","6-8 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The tool can be applied to increase productivity of legal review, share legal knowledge with service managers, and reduce legal risk in contract review process.","1082-3409;10823409","Electronic:978-1-4799-2972-6; POD:978-1-4799-2973-3; USB:978-1-4799-2971-9","10.1109/ICTAI.2013.109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6735320","Natural language processing;contract analysis;information extraction;information retrieval;semantics","Artificial intelligence;Contracts;Data mining;Law;Semantics;Syntactics","artificial intelligence;contracts;gas turbines;natural language processing;service industries;text analysis","contract analysis;contract review process;contract search tool;contractual service agreement;gas turbines;implicitly-stated provisions;legal concepts;legal knowledge sharing;legal review;legal risk reduction;natural language processing;semantic text analysis;semantic-based system;semantics model;text paragraphs identification","","1","","24","","","4-6 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Mining YouTube metadata for detecting privacy invading harassment and misdemeanor videos","N. Aggarwal; S. Agrawal; A. Sureka","Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIITD), India","2014 Twelfth Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust","20140908","2014","","","84","93","YouTube is one of the most popular and largest video sharing websites (with social networking features) on the Internet. A significant percentage of videos uploaded on YouTube contains objectionable content and violates YouTube community guidelines. YouTube contains several copyright violated videos, commercial spam, hate and extremism promoting videos, vulgar and pornographic material and privacy invading content. This is primarily due to the low publication barrier and anonymity. We present an approach to identify privacy invading harassment and misdemeanor videos by mining the video metadata. We divide the problem into sub-problems: vulgar video detection, abuse and violence in public places and ragging video detection in school and colleges. We conduct a characterization study on a training dataset by downloading several videos using YouTube API and manually annotating the dataset. We define several discriminatory features for recognizing the target class objects. We employ a one class classifier approach to detect the objectionable video and frame the problem as a recognition problem. Our empirical analysis on test dataset reveals that linguistic features (presence of certain terms and people in the title and description of the main and related videos), popularity based, duration and category of videos can be used to predict the video type. We validate our hypothesis by conducting a series of experiments on evaluation dataset acquired from YouTube. Empirical results reveal that accuracy of proposed approach is more than 80% demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3503-1; POD:978-1-4799-3504-8","10.1109/PST.2014.6890927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890927","Information Retrieval;Mining User Generated Content;One Class Classifier;Privacy Invading Video Detection;Social Media Analytics;YouTube","Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Pragmatics;Privacy;Videos;YouTube","Internet;application program interfaces;computational linguistics;copyright;data mining;data privacy;feature extraction;image classification;meta data;object detection;object recognition;social networking (online)","Internet;YouTube API;YouTube metadata mining;abuse;classifier approach;commercial spam;copyright violated videos;dataset annotation;discriminatory features;extremism promoting videos;harassment;hate promoting videos;linguistic features;misdemeanor videos;objectionable video detection;popularity based video;pornographic material;privacy invading content;privacy invading harassment detection;ragging video detection;social networking features;target class object recognition;test dataset;training dataset;video category;video duration;video metadata mining;video sharing Websites;violence;vulgar material;vulgar video detection","","1","","24","","","23-24 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the information about the user stored in a user profile, these techniques retrieve results that are closer to the user preferences. On the other hand, the information is being stored more and more in an semi-structured way, and XML has emerged as a standard for representing and exchanging this type of data. XML search allows a higher retrieval effectiveness, due to its ability to retrieve and to show the user specific parts of the documents instead of the full document. In this paper we propose several personalization techniques in the context of XML retrieval. We try to combine the different approaches where personalization may be applied: query reformulation, re-ranking of results and retrieval model modification. The experimental results obtained from a user study using a parliamentary document collection support the validity of our approach.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514872","CAS queries;Information Retrieval;Information retrieval;Personalization;Query Expansion;Reranking;XML;personalization;query expansion;reranking","Containers;Context;Ontologies;Proposals;Search engines;Standards;XML","XML;information retrieval;search problems","XML search;ambiguous queries;document collection;improve XML retrieval personalization;personalization techniques;personalized search techniques;query reformulation;user profile","","3","","51","","20130513","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Computing iceberg queries efficiently using bitmap index positions","V. Shankar; C. V. Guru Rao","Dept. of Comput.

The iceberg queries are mainly intended to compute small outputs from large databases and or data warehouses provided on the user thresholds. The aggregate values are useful in computing knowledge which is delightful in taking part of the important decisions by an industry people such as knowledge workers, managers, and analysts in the field of decision support, information retrieval and knowledge discovery systems. The basic bitmap index technique offers a long execution time to compute the iceberg queries since it requires conducting of bitwise-AND operations between all pairs of bitmaps. Further, this execution time increases when the cardinality of an attribute increases. Therefore to quickly compute the iceberg queries, algorithm fetches the index positions of all 1bit from each bitmap vector in the bitmap table. Further, these indexed positions are processed to determine the common positions of the 1 bit between pair of bitmaps which answer as an iceberg query with minimum execution time. Exhaustive experimentation demonstrates our approach is much more efficient than existing strategy.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5703-6; POD:978-1-4673-5702-9","10.1109/ICHCI-IEEE.2013.6887811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6887811","Bitmap vector;Database;Index position;Information retrieval system","Aggregates;Algorithm design and analysis;Indexes;Partitioning algorithms;Query processing;Vectors","data mining;data warehouses;decision support systems;query processing","bitmap index positions;bitmap table;bitmap vector;data warehouses;decision support;iceberg queries;information retrieval;knowledge discovery systems;large databases;specialized index position algorithm","","0","","19","","","23-24 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The overall purpose is to investigate whether musicologists can draw benefit from Echo Nest's API, and to explore what practical and analytical consideration one should take into account when engaging with the numbers derived from the Echo Nest API. This paper suggests that the Echo Nest API hold a large potential of doing new types of analyses and visualizing the results.

On the front-end, a large set of segmental acoustic features is extracted to model short-term variations. Then, multi-variate regression is performed by deep recurrent neural networks to model longer-range context and capture the time-varying emotional profile of musical pieces appropriately. Evaluation is done on the 2013 MediaEval Challenge corpus consisting of 1000 pieces annotated in continous time and continuous arousal and valence by crowd-sourcing. In the result, recurrent neural networks outperform SVR and feedforward neural networks both in continuous-time and static music mood regression, and achieve an R<sup>2</sup> of up to .70 and .50 with arousal and valence annotations.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4799-2893-4; POD:978-1-4799-2894-1; USB:978-1-4799-2892-7","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854637","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854637","emotion recognition;music information retrieval;recurrent neural networks","Acoustics;Emotion recognition;Maximum likelihood estimation;Mood;Recurrent neural networks;Training","emotion recognition;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);music;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis","MediaEval challenge corpus;SVR;crowd-sourcing;deep recurrent neural network;feedforward neural networks;longer-range context;low-latency prediction;machine learning approach;multivariate regression;musical pieces valence;musical time-varying arousal;online continuous-time music mood regression;segmental acoustic features;short-term variations model;static music mood regression;support vector regression;time-varying emotional profile","","8","","21","","","4-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
