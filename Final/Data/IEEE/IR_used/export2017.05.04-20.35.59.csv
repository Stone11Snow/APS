We realized speed-up of string pattern matching using data compression. Although we obtain higher compression ratio using a finite state model, it doesn't lead speed-up of string pattern matching. Because the pattern matching machine becomes very large, when compression codes are complex. Random Access Memory (RAM) are scattered with states used frequently Such states are close to the initial state of pattern matching machine. We rearrange states so as to collecting states used frequently for CPU cache eficiency. We renumber states in breadth-first order.

Recollection can be defined as the effort needed to recall an even, an idea or a resource. In IR, when locating an interesting resource, a user can tag it in order to ""memorize"" it and retrieve it later. The user chooses the tags according to his/her needs or centers of interest. While previous work has addressed the problem of tag exploitation, to our knowledge, an important dimension is missing. None has focused on the tagging activity itself when considering the users point of view. An important open question is the following: will a user be able to remember tags he/she associated with a document in the past in order to retrieve a document again? Our paper tackles this problem. Considering a user study that implied 32 participants, we evaluate some elements (age, time…) that impacts the recognition and the recall of tags used in the past. This result is important specifically as it can be used in order to optimize personalized systems (e.g. user profiling, tag exploitation…).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5698-9; POD:978-1-5090-5699-6","10.1109/SITIS.2016.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7907493","Human Characteristics;Information Retrieval;Recollection;Study;Tag","Atmospheric measurements;Browsers;Extraterrestrial measurements;HTML;Particle measurements;Tagging","","","","","","","","","Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Question retrieval in cQA archives aims to find the existing questions that are semantically equivalent or relevant to the queried questions. However, the lexical gap problem brings a new challenge for question retrieval in cQA. In this paper, we propose to model and learn distributed word representations with metadata of category information within cQA pages for question retrieval using two novel category powered models. One is a basic category powered model called MB-NET and the other one is an enhanced category powered model called ME-NET which can better learn the distributed word representations and alleviate the lexical gap problem. To deal with the variable size of word representation vectors, we employ the framework of fisher kernel to transform them into the fixed-length vectors. Experimental results on large-scale English and Chinese cQA data sets show that our proposed approaches can significantly outperform state-of-the-art retrieval models for question retrieval in cQA. Moreover, we further conduct our approaches on large-scale automatic evaluation experiments.

One of the approaches, called RUBRIC (RUle-Based Retrieval of Information by Computer), uses production rules to capture user query concepts (or topics). A set of related production rules is represented as an AND/OR tree, called a rule-based tree. One of the main problems in this approach is how to construct such rules that can capture user query concepts. This paper provides a logical framework that is semantically essential to defining the rules for the user query concepts, and proposes a way to automatically construct rule-based trees from typical thesauri.

Several hashing-based search methods that provide effective solutions to the ANN search problem have been proposed. However, most of these focus on similarity preservation and coding error minimization, and pay little attention to optimizing the precision–recall curve or receiver operating characteristic curve. In this paper, we propose a novel projection-based hashing method that attempts to maximize precision and recall. We first introduce an uncorrelated component analysis (UCA) transformation by examining precision and recall, and then propose a UCA-based hashing method. The proposed method is evaluated with a variety of datasets. The results show that UCA-based hashing outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and has computationally efficient training and encoding processes.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2017.2695099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7903624","Hashing;Information Retrieval","Complexity theory;Databases;Hamming distance;Linear programming;Principal component analysis;Quantization (signal);Search problems","","","","","","","","20170418","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The goal is to preprocess the set so that, given a set of objects and a query, one can retrieve those objects close enough to the query. The number of distances computed to achieve this goal is the complexity measure. The problem is very difficult in the so-called high dimensional metric spaces, where the histogram of distances has a large mean and a small variance. A recent survey on methods to index metric spaces has shown that the so-called clustering algorithms are better suited than their competitors, pivot based algorithms, to cope with high dimensional metric spaces. The authors present a new clustering method that achieves much better performance than all the existing data structures.

The scatter plots of the two measures (average acoustic stress on the y-axis and IR index on the x-axis) show higher values of average acoustic stress with increasing IR index of the word in the majority of the analysed utterances. A statistically more valid proof of such a relationship is derived from a histogram of the words with high average acoustic stress vs. the IR index.

Human subjects readily ascribe the property Â¿slaveÂ¿ to this combination when it is not an associate ascribed to Â¿petÂ¿, or Â¿humanÂ¿ in isolation. Such emergent associations sometimes have a creative character and cognitive science is largely silent about how we produce them. Departing from a three-level model of cognition, this presentation will explore concept combinations, and will argue emergent associations are a result of abductive reasoning within conceptual space, that is, below the symbolic level of cognition. A tensor based approach is used to model concept combinations allowing such combinations to be conceived as interacting quantum systems. Free association norm data is used to motivate the underlying basis of the conceptual space. In this way it will be shown how some concept combinations behave like quantum-entangled particles, and empirical experiments will be reported which attempt to verify the existence of non-separable concept combinations in cognition. It is conjectured there may be a connection between the nonseparability of a concept combination and its propensity to yield emergent associates. Broadly speaking, this presentation takes the position that emergent technologies for Â¿exploring the invisible worldÂ¿ will need to be aligned with human cognition and that quantum models of cognition may provide an innovative and fruitful theoretical basis for such emergent technologies.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466900","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466900","","","cognition;inference mechanisms;quantum computing","abductive reasoning;cognition model;cognitive science;concept combination;conceptual space;emergent associations;free association norm data;interacting quantum systems;quantum-entangled particles;tensor based approach","","0","","19","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A subquadratic algorithm for cluster and outlier detection in massive metric data","E. Chavez","Universidad Michoacana","Proceedings Eighth Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval","20050627","2001","","","46","58","The problem of cluster and outlier detection is a classic problem of non-parametric statistics. In recent times the need for cluster analysis in massive multimedia data sets (terabytes of data sampled from a metric space) have demonstrated the need for solutions both in the sense of being capable of automatic clustering metric data and at reasonable speed. Since cluster properties involve the relationship between each pair of data set elements, a good clustering algorithm must examine (in principle) every distance pair and hence has quadratic complexity. An appealing trend to achieve subquadratic complexity is either a) to use an approximation for a classic clustering algorithm or b) to design a new algorithm for clustering. This paper presents a new clustering algorithm performing O<sup>(n<sup>1+α</sup>)</sup> distance computations (the operation ofleading complexity), with 0 ⩽ α ⩽ 1 a constant depending on the intrinsic dimension of the sample data. The algorithm can detect outliers in the sample data and, if desired, it can produce a hierarchical structure (a dendogram) pointing to clusters at different resolutions.","","POD:0-7695-1192-9","10.1109/SPIRE.2001.989736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989736","","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Databases;Extraterrestrial measurements;Inverse problems;Partitioning algorithms;Shape;Statistics","","","","0","","15","","","13-15 Nov. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are still many challenges to be overcome and in this paper we highlight some of these together with some approaches that we have developed to address these problems. In particular, we focus on the issues of colour (or more precise colour variance), image compression, and image database browsing. While colour features are the most widely used image descriptors for CBIR, colour is not necessarily a stable cue as it also depends on various image capture conditions. Colour invariants are features designed to be robust with respect to these confounding factors. Image compression, which is typically applied to most images in use, leads to both processing overheads but also to a small but noticeable drop in retrieval performance. To address these problems, we have developed image retrieval techniques that operate directly in the compressed domain, yet provide better retrieval performance than many standard CBIR techniques. Finally, we look at browsing systems as an alternative approach to dealing with large image databases. The hue sphere browsing system that we have developed organises images on a spherical visualisation space so that visually similar images are located close to each other, and provides powerful interaction tools that aid in exploring the visualised image collections.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466891","CVPIC;Content-based image retrieval;colour;colour invariance;compressed-domain retrieval;hue sphere browsing;image compression;image database browsing;image databases","","content-based retrieval;data compression;image coding;image colour analysis;visual databases","CBIR techniques;colour features;colour invariants;content-based image retrieval;hue sphere browsing system;image compression;image database","","6","","50","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Utilization of IR methods in service discovery approaches makes the discovery process efficient. In this paper, we focus on those service discovery approaches which employ information retrieval methods for the purpose of automatic discovery. This paper provides a survey of how these approaches differ from each other while discovering a service.","","DVD:978-1-5090-1064-6; Electronic:978-1-5090-1066-0; POD:978-1-5090-1067-7; Paper:978-1-5090-1065-3","10.1109/CESYS.2016.7889916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889916","Information Retrieval etc;Web Service Discovery","Information retrieval;Probabilistic logic;Semantics;Service-oriented architecture;Simple object access protocol;XML","Web services;information retrieval","IR models;Web service discovery;automatic discovery;information retrieval methods","","","","","","","21-22 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SPIRE 2000","20020806","2000","","","17","27","Trying to find information on the Web is like trying to find something at a jumble sale: it is fun, and you can make serendipitous discoveries, but for directed search it is better to go to a department store; there, someone has already done most of the arranging for you. Unfortunately, the Web's continuing explosion in size, its enormous diversity of topics, and its great volatility, make unaided human indexing impossible. This problem is just a special case of the general problem of organizing information to create knowledge. A similar problem arises on the desktop when dealing with file systems, where users must search by name. When searching for a particular file, however, users often do not remember the file's name or location. File names are artifacts of current operating systems, but human understanding neither requires objects to be named, nor does it have problems with multiple objects sharing properties, names, for instance. That more general approach is not developed in current file systems or user interfaces. We argue for an approach to information representation based on the use of attributes and search. This representation is organization-neutral, thereby giving a flexible substrate for anyone to build multiple simultaneous organizations. We argue the approach from three perspectives: Attribute Value System (AVS), a networked storage system where objects are composed solely of attribute-value pairs; DomainView (DV), a desktop metaphor where objects do not have explicit names and retrieval is done by content; and KnownSpace (KS), a personalized desktop data manager","","POD:0-7695-0746-8","10.1109/SPIRE.2000.878176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878176","","Explosions;File systems;Humans;Indexing;Information management;Information representation;Marketing and sales;Operating systems;Organizing;User interfaces","Internet;information resources;information retrieval;user interfaces","Attribute Value System;DomainView;KnownSpace;World Wide Web;attribute-centric data systems;content based retrieval;desktop metaphor;directed search;file systems;indexing;information management;information representation;networked storage system;operating systems;personalized desktop data manager;user interfaces","","12","70","15","","","2000","27 Sep 2000-29 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The last part consists of presenting an indexed approximate string matching application in bioinformatics, which is the search of unique oligonucleotides. We present practical comparisons and results for using different filtering schemes in this application. Our tests have involved a total of 15 different genomes, from which we present some results involving the largest two of these: The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) and a recent draft of the human genome, the latter being also the main target of the application.","","POD:0-7695-1192-9","10.1109/SPIRE.2001.989742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989742","","Acceleration;Application software;Bioinformatics;Costs;Genomics;Indexing;Information filtering;Information filters;Matched filters;Pattern matching","","","","0","","26","","","13-15 Nov. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the vocabulary mismatch problem between different artifacts hinders the performance of IR-based approaches. A growing body of work addresses this issue by combining IR techniques with code dependency analysis such as method calls. However, so far the performance of combined approaches is highly dependent to the correctness of IR techniques and does not take full advantage of the code dependency analysis. In this paper, we combine IR techniques with closeness analysis to improve IR-based traceability recovery. Specifically, we quantify and utilize the “closeness” for each call and data dependency between two classes to improve rankings of traceability candidate lists. An empirical evaluation based on three real-world systems suggests that our approach outperforms three baseline approaches.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5501-2; POD:978-1-5090-5502-9","10.1109/SANER.2017.7884610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7884610","Call Dependencies;Closeness Analysis;Data Dependencies;Information Retrieval;Traceability Recovery","Biomedical monitoring;Context;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Software;Vocabulary","information retrieval;program diagnostics;software engineering","IR techniques;IR-based traceability recovery improvement;artifact vocabulary mismatch problem;code dependency closeness analysis;data dependency;information retrieval;software artifacts;textual similarities","","","","","","","20-24 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Local prediction had been estimated by a Bayesian approach and shown that sequence information induces strongly the local fold, but stays coarse (prediction rate of 40.7% with one PB, 75,8% with the four most probable PBs). The Hybrid Protein Model presented in this study learns both the sequence and structure of the proteins.

Experiments in document retrieval regarding English text suggest that word stemming based on morphological analysis does not generally or consistently outperform ad-hoc hand tuned algorithms such as that proposed by M. Porter (1980). It is difficult to produce a Porter style algorithm for a romantic language such as Spanish, however due to the greater grammatical complexity and due to the fact that inflection often causes changes to the root of words, not just to their endings (as is mostly the case with English). In general terms, the difficulty consists of producing an algorithm which can cope with the additional complexity of Spanish morphology whilst preserving the simplicity of a Porter style algorithm. One such algorithm is presented. The algorithm combines dictionary look-ups with some 300 stemming and intermediate reduction rules","","POD:0-7695-0746-8","10.1109/SPIRE.2000.878189","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878189","","Algorithm design and analysis;Dictionaries;Information retrieval;Information science;Morphology;Natural languages;Uninterruptible power systems","dictionaries;natural languages;table lookup;word processing","English text;Porter style algorithm;Spanish language;Spanish morphology;ad-hoc hand tuned algorithms;dictionary look-ups;document retrieval;grammatical complexity;inflection;intermediate reduction rules;morphological analysis;word roots;word stemming algorithm","","3","2","8","","","2000","27 Sep 2000-29 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The necessity of proper information has increased. The most basic tools which provide this service are browser. It traverses the data as per user's query and gives the search results of all related information. Hence, it becomes a time consuming process to find required information. In this paper, the focus is done on content based data mining using ontology and text feature extraction. Content based data mining process focuses on domain of the data. Ontology, itself is a domain based data set information system that will help to achieve required data retrieval in a more appropriate way. The proposed system uses k means clustering algorithm for creation of flat clusters. Flat clusters are the primary classification or clusters of data that are used for Hierarchical clustering. For the proposed system Hierarchical Fuzzy Relational Eigenvector Centrality-based Clustering Algorithm (HFRECCA) is used. This technique of clustering is very fast and gives more accurate results. For more appropriate data retrieval, this system uses text feature extraction algorithm. This algorithm will help to reduce the noisy data from data sets. A noise free data will help to perform better data retrieval process. Implemented system works over various types of text file such as PDF, .txt, DOC, DOCX. This system is also compatible with other types of files like WebPages, images etc.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1338-8; POD:978-1-5090-1339-5","10.1109/CAST.2016.7914997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7914997","Domain ontology;Feature extraction;Flat clusters;Hierarchical clustering;Text data;information retrieval","Algorithm design and analysis;Browsers;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Feature extraction;Ontologies;Partitioning algorithms","","","","","","","","","19-21 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The authors explore an alternative approach to exploiting these properties by building virtual test tubes in software that would capture the fundamental advantages of biomolecules, in the same way that evolutionary algorithms capture in silico the key properties of Darwinian evolution.

Web search engines maintains user profile for better search results which could raise serious privacy issues. In order to intact the users privacy in front of a web search engines Private information retrieval (PIR) protocols are used which hide the identity of the user by submitting his/her query through other group member. A basic problem is related with these protocols are their predictability. This paper is the extension of previous work in which a person with anonymous query was successfully identified. This paper aims to find all queries submitted by the target user using UPIR and UUP protocols. For experimentation purpose a machine learning based adversarial model is proposed to find the actual queries of user of interest based on the previous profile. The results shows that the precision, recall and f-measure of J48 in finding user's real queries is more then 0.70 on the average. Similarly J48 reported highest trues positive rate of above 0.7 and lowest false positive rate of 0.006. It was also observed that the size of training data has very little effect on accuracy according to this experiment.","","CD:978-1-5090-4447-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-4448-1; POD:978-1-5090-4449-8","10.1109/C-CODE.2017.7918908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7918908","Classification;Private Information Retrieval;Query Privacy;Web Search Privacy","","","","","","","","","","8-9 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This formulation allows for decoupling the representation size from the number of used codewords, as well as for better modeling the feature distribution using a separate trainable scaling parameter for each RBF neuron. The resulting network, called retrieval-oriented neural BoF (RN-BoF), is trained using regular back propagation and allows for fast extraction of compact image representations. It is demonstrated that the RN-BoF model is capable of: 1) increasing the object encoding and retrieval speed; 2) reducing the extracted representation size; and 3) increasing the retrieval precision. A symmetry-aware spatial segmentation technique is also proposed to further reduce the encoding time and the storage requirements and allows the method to efficiently scale to large datasets. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to other state-of-the-art techniques using five different image datasets, including the large-scale YouTube Faces database.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2017.2680404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7888593","Bag-of-features (BoFs) representation;information retrieval;neural networks;retrieval-oriented optimization","Dictionaries;Encoding;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image retrieval;Image segmentation","","","","","","","","20170328","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A significant fraction of this information contains multimedia data to share the experience with their audience. A systematic information modeling and management framework is necessary to capture this widely heterogeneous, schemaless, potentially humongous information produced by many different people. This book is an attempt to examine the modeling, storage, querying, and applications of such an event management system in a holistic manner. It uses a semantic-web style graph-based view of events, and shows how this event model, together with its query facility, can be used toward emerging applications like semi-automated storytelling.

"Bit-parallel approach to approximate string matching in compressed texts","T. Matsumoto; T. Kida; M. Takeda; A. Shinohara; S. Arikawa","Dept. of Inf., Kyushu Univ., Fukuoka, Japan","Proceedings Seventh International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval. SPIRE 2000","20020806","2000","","","221","228","Addresses the problem of approximate string matching on compressed text. We consider this problem for a text string described in terms of a collage system, which is a formal system proposed by T. Kida et al. (1999) that captures various dictionary-based compression methods. We present an algorithm that exploits bit-parallelism, assuming that our problem fits in a single machine word, e.g. (m-k)(k+1)&les;L, where m is the pattern length, k is the number of allowed errors and L is the length, in bits, of the machine word. For a class of simple collage systems, the algorithm runs in O(k<sup>2</sup>(||&Dscr;||+|&Sscr;|)+km) time using O(k<sup>2</sup>||&Dscr;||) space, where ||&Dscr;|| is the size of dictionary &Dscr; and |&Sscr;| is the number of tokens in the sequence &Sscr;. The LZ78 (Lempel-Ziv, 1978) and the LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch, 1984) compression methods are covered by this class. Since we can regard n=||&Dscr;||+|&Sscr;| as the compressed length, the time and space complexities are O(k<sup>2</sup>n+km) and O(k <sup>2</sup>n), respectively. For general k and m, they become O(k<sup>3 </sup>mn/L+km) and O(k<sup>3</sup>mn/L). Thus, our algorithm is competitive to the algorithm proposed by J. Kärkkäinen, et al. (2000), which runs in O(km) time using O(kmn) space, when k=O(√L)","","POD:0-7695-0746-8","10.1109/SPIRE.2000.878198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878198","","Automata;Dictionaries;Informatics;Pattern matching","computational complexity;data compression;string matching","Ziv-Lempel compression methods;allowed errors;approximate string matching;bit-parallelism;collage system;compressed length;compressed texts;dictionary size;dictionary-based compression methods;machine word;pattern length;space complexity;time complexity;token sequence","","4","","15","","","2000","27 Sep 2000-29 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Viziometrics: Analyzing Visual Information in the Scientific Literature","P. s. Lee; J. D. West; B. Howe","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98105. (e-mail: sephon@uw.edu).","IEEE Transactions on Big Data","","2017","PP","99","1","1","Scientific results are communicated visually in the literature through diagrams, visualizations, and photographs. These information-dense objects have been largely ignored in bibliometrics and scientometrics studies when compared to citations and text. In this paper, we use techniques from computer vision and machine learning to classify more than 8 million figures from PubMed into 5 figure types and study the resulting patterns of visual information as they relate to scholarly impact. We find that the distribution of figures and figure types in the literature has remained relatively constant over time, but can vary widely across field and topic. Remarkably, we find a significant correlation between scientific impact and the use of visual information, where higher impact papers tend to include more diagrams, and to a lesser extent more plots. To explore these results and other ways of extracting this visual information, we have built a visual browser to illustrate the concept and explore design alternatives for supporting viziometric analysis and organizing visual information. We use these results to articulate a new research agenda – viziometrics – to study the organization and presentation of visual information in the scientific literature.","","","10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2689038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7888968","Bibliometrics;Figure Retrieval;Information Retrieval;Meta Research;Scholarly Communication;Scientometrics;Viziometrics","Bibliometrics;Big Data;Encoding;Metadata;Pipelines;Search engines;Visualization","","","","","","","","20170329","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
