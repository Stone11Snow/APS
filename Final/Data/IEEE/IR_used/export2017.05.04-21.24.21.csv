In this paper, we propose a novel method for multilingual text categorization using latent semantic indexing. The centroid of each class has been calculated in the decomposed SVD space. The similarity threshold of categorization is predefined for each centroid. Test documents with similarity measurement larger than the threshold is labeled ""positive"" (relevant) or else would be labeled ""negative"" (non-relevant).

At each stage of the simplification, edges are extracted from the image and gathered in a scale-map, over which a perceptual subsegment analysis is performed in order to extract true object boundaries. The analysis is mainly motivated by Gestalt laws and our experimental results suggest a promising performance for main objects extraction, even for images with crowded textural edges and objects with color, texture, and illumination variations.

Traditional Web CBIR functions are encapsulated in six agent classes via object-oriented idea. The retrieval domain is modelled as a multi-agent system, where, agent objects operate autonomously while cooperate with each other, and its coordination with outside environment can result in Web CBIR. During retrieval, the system can decide an optimized retrieval strategy by automatically analyzing initial query input with its repository, and through feedback, it can also make corresponding adjustment by intelligently deducing user intent and interest, without any human interference if necessary. Furthermore, the mobility enables the search agent to perform local image match at database source, which is expected to improve retrieval speed and reliability by minimizing network traffic and dependence on network status. In addition, the repository management agent with heterogeneous database classifying and indexing ability is also expected to further extend search range and ensure retrieval efficiency.

In order to provide meaningful visualizations and to extract useful knowledge from document collections, user needs must be captured by the internal representation of documents, and the used similarity measure. In most applications the vector space model and the cosine similarity are used therefore and serve as good approximations. Nevertheless, influencing similarities between documents is rather hard, since parameter tuning relies heavily on expert knowledge of the underlying algorithms, and the influence of different weighting schemes and similarity measures is not known before. In this paper we present an approach on how to adapt the vector space representation of documents by giving visual feedback to the system. Our approach starts by clustering a corpus of text documents and visualizing the results using multi dimensional scaling techniques. Afterwards, a 2D landscape visualization is shown which can be manipulated by the user. Based on these manipulations the high dimensional representation of the documents is adapted to fit the users need more precisely. Our experiments show that iterating these steps results in an adapted representation of documents and similarities, generating layouts as intended by the user and furthermore increases clustering accuracy.

However, XML focuses only on the syntax of data instead of the semantic and at the same time user get full freedom to model XML sources according to their local requirements. Therefore, these sources of the same domain adapt to different structures may represent data with similar semantic. In our work, we concentrate on integrating heterogeneous XML sources of the same domain to eliminate the structural differences of the user queries (accessing these sources) while they represent similar semantic. In this paper, we proposed a general architecture of semantic mediation approach based on OWL ontology. We also highlight how we can take the profit of OWL for integrating (or interoperating) local Ontologies that will be a great help for the completion of our architecture.","","POD:0-7803-9521-2","10.1109/ICTTA.2006.1684425","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1684425","","Computer networks;Database systems;Information retrieval;Internet;Mediation;OWL;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Web sites;XML","","","","0","","11","","","24-28 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To mine more semantic information accurately, an over-completed description space of image content based on region is first built. Furthermore, the non-parametric estimation is applied to modeling the over-completed description space with the premise of not knowing any prior knowledge about it.

An application that processes data from a remote repository needs to be broken into several stages, including a data retrieval task at the data repository, a data movement task, and a data processing task at a computing site. Because of the volume of data that is involved and the amount of processing, it is desirable that both the data repository and computing site may be clusters. This can further complicate the development of such data processing applications. In this paper, we present a middleware, FREERIDE-G (framework for rapid implementation of datamining engines in grid), which support a high-level interface for developing data mining and scientific data processing applications that involve data stored in remote repositories. Particularly, we had the following goals behind designing the FREERIDE-G middleware: 1) support high-end processing, i.e., use parallel configurations for both hosting the data and processing the data, 2) ease use of parallel configurations, i.e., support a high-level API for specifying the processing, and 3) hide details of data movement and caching. We have evaluated our system using three popular data mining algorithms and two scientific data analysis applications. The main observations from our experiments are as follows. First, FREERIDE-G is able to scale the processing extremely well when the number of data server and compute nodes are scaled evenly. Second, when only the number of compute nodes are scaled, our target class of applications achieve modest additional speedups. Finally, for applications that involve multiple passes on the dataset, caching remote data provides significant improvement","0190-3918;01903918","POD:0-7695-2636-5","10.1109/ICPP.2006.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1690611","","Application software;Computational modeling;Computer science;Data analysis;Data engineering;Data mining;Data processing;Engines;Information retrieval;Middleware","data mining;grid computing;middleware;natural sciences computing;very large databases","FREERIDE-G middleware;high-end processing;large geographically distributed scientific datasets;parallel configurations;remote data repositories mining;scientific data analysis;scientific data processing","","1","","25","","","14-18 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the fast growing information age, available methods for finding and using information on the Web are often insufficient. Today's retrieval methods are typically limited to keywords searches or sub string matches; therefore, users may often miss critical information when searching the Web. A query system is needed to support efficient geospatial information retrieval based on geospatial relations. We need to combine GIScience and semantic Web technology. To accomplish the development of geospatial semantic Web, two research issues are apparent: 1st is geospatial data query and 2nd is method to assess the semantics of available data sources. We have proposed to develop geospatial semantic query system by integrating geospatial reasoning. In this paper, we propose a method to extend and enhance semantic similarity measures between geospatial entity classes. We need to measure semantic similarity and geospatial similarity to query geospatial semantic. So, our proposed method contains two portions. The first portion contains a function of semantic similarity to measure semantic similarity of geospatial entity classes. The second portion contains a function of geospatial similarity (GSS) to measure spatial similarity of geospatial entity classes that have semantic similarity.

The objective of the proposed research is to automatically segment data records in a page, extract data items/fields from these records, and store the extracted data in a database. Existing methods addressing the problem can be classified into three categories. Methods in the first category provide some languages to facilitate the construction of data extraction systems. Methods in the second category use machine learning techniques to learn wrappers (which are data extraction programs) from human labeled examples. Manual labeling is time-consuming and is hard to scale to a large number of sites on the Web. Methods in the third category are based on the idea of automatic pattern discovery. However, multiple pages that conform to a common schema are usually needed as the input. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective technique (called DEPTA) to perform the task of Web data extraction automatically. The method consists of two steps: 1) identifying individual records in a page and 2) aligning and extracting data items from the identified records. For step 1, a method based on visual information and tree matching is used to segment data records. For step 2, a novel partial alignment technique is proposed. This method aligns only those data items in a pair of records that can be aligned with certainty, making no commitment on the rest of the items.

Based on individual difference of learners' abilities and preferred learning styles in hypermedia environment, the learning outcomes vary essentially. Meanwhile, with the development of e-learning technologies, learners can be provided more effective learning environment to optimize their learning. Adaptive e-learning systems are built to personalize and adapt e-learning content, pedagogical models, and interactions between participants in the environment to meet the individual needs and preferences of users if and when they arise. The learner model is an essential component in adaptive e-learning systems since it is used to modify the interaction between system and learners to suit the needs of individual learners. While learner model plays an important role in the personalization of e-learning systems, it is seen as a part of the e-learning system in many applications. In our paper, we first explain the reason of why this issue prevents the e-learning systems to provide better personalized support to meet the individual learning requirements. Then we propose a novel centralized learner model technique for e-learning systems to overcome those problems. To achieve the goal to design a learner model for distributed systems meeting the requirements, the paper introduce five work steps: analyze e-learning standards, articulate modeling requirements, develop the representation of learning styles, generate learner activity ontology and design the learner model.

Each ""smart"" temperature sensor integrates a thermistor element, measurement circuitry, power control, calibration coefficient storage, temperature computation, and data communications. Multiple addressable sensors at discrete vertical depths are deployed along a three-wire cable that provides power and allows data transfer at regular intervals. Circuit, manufacturing, and automated calibration techniques allow temperature measurements with a resolution of plusmn0.003degC, and with intersensor matching of plusmn0.006degC. The low cost of each sensor is achieved by using poor tolerance thermistor and circuit components in conjunction with a 15-bit charge-balance analog-to-digital converter. Sensor inaccuracies and temperature coefficients are corrected by a two-point calibration procedure made possible by a standard-curve generator within the sensor, based upon the method of finite differences.

When there are some outputs available (e.g., regression values or classification results), it is often beneficial to consider supervised projection, which is based not only on the inputs, but also on the target values. While this applies to a single-output setting, we are more interested in applications with multiple outputs, where several tasks need to be learned simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce a novel projection approach called multi-output regularized feature projection (MORP), which preserves the information of input features and, meanwhile, captures the correlations between inputs/outputs and (if applicable) between multiple outputs. This is done by introducing a latent variable model on the joint input-output space and minimizing the reconstruction errors for both inputs and outputs. It turns out that the mappings can be found by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem and are ready to extend to nonlinear mappings. Prediction accuracy can be greatly improved by using the new features since the structure of outputs is explored. We validate our approach in two applications. In the first setting, we predict users' preferences for a set of paintings. The second is concerned with image and text categorization where each image (or document) may belong to multiple categories.

However, the price to pay for these incredible benefits is the amount of crosstalk among stored patterns that sometimes leads to mis-recognition of some of the stored items. In this paper, this adverse effect arising from the superimposed storage can be greatly alleviated by optimizing the different sequencies of the Walsh functions associated with each pattern to be stored. This optimization also lends itself to maximize the memory capacity by jamming more patterns onto the same memory space still maintaining perfect recognition.

It is used to retrieve the client's registered fingerprint from central database, which is then matched with extracted fingerprint via fingerprint recognition method to verify user's identity. This system is more reliable and secure than transferring password alone. The data are embedded with quantization watermark in the JPEG 2000 coding pipeline. Compare to our previous proposed system, the interaction time can be reduced because less data will be transmitted. When the fingerprint image is compressed to 1/4~1/20 of its original size, the embedded watermark can still be recovered. This system has been used in a bank pension distribution system.

Emphasis is then given on the spectral normalization for the fusion of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Instrument (MERIS) data with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and VEGETATION (VGT) data. Two methods are evaluated: a simple statistical method, which relies on a linear regression using all the available spectral bands, and a more innovative method called the spectral mode method, which is based on the restitution of the surface spectral signature by a combination of universal spectral functions. Analysis with Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral data and satellite products reveals that the spectral mode method is more efficient. This approach is used to merge top-of-canopy bidirectional reflectances from MERIS and VGT for the restitution of BRDF and albedo over a subset of West Africa.

The main responsibility of the rule manager is triggering, buffering, firing and selecting (scheduling) rules. Rule scheduling approach has considerable impact on performance and efficiency of ADBS. In this paper, we propose a new approach for improving the rule scheduling in ADBS. We first introduce a framework to compare and evaluate existing rule scheduling approaches. In this framework, five evaluation criteria have been proposed: Average Response Time, Response Time Variance, Throughput, Time Overhead per Transaction and CPU Utilization. Existing approaches have been evaluated by using this framework and the approach which has the most positive impact on performance and efficiency of ADBS has been selected by analyzing the weaknesses and strengths of existing approaches. Then, to improve the selected rule scheduling approach, we developed an Event Triggering Probability Estimation algorithm and integrated this algorithm to selected rule scheduling approach.

In query-based sensor systems, a user would issue a query with quality of service (QoS) requirements in terms of reliability and timeliness, and expect a response to be returned within the deadline. Satisfying these QoS requirements implies that fault tolerance mechanisms through redundancy will be used, which may cause the energy of the system to be quickly depleted. We develop a hop-by-hop data delivery mechanism in which we utilize ""source"" and ""path"" redundancy with the goal to satisfy application QoS requirements while maximizing the lifetime of the sensor system. When given QoS requirements of a query, we identify optimal ""source"" and ""path"" redundancy such that not only QoS requirements are satisfied, but also the lifetime of the system is prolonged. Numerical data are presented with physical interpretations given to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.","1526-7539;15267539","POD:0-7695-2573-3","10.1109/MASCOTS.2006.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1698536","QoS.;Wireless sensor networks;conservation;energy;query processing;redundancy;reliability;timeliness","Command and control systems;Communication system security;Data security;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Quality of service;Redundancy;Sensor systems;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","","QoS.;Wireless sensor networks;conservation;energy;query processing;redundancy;reliability;timeliness","","1","","9","","","11-14 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show how to eliminate this problem by choosing for each chunk a replication level that is a function of the amount of data that would be lost if that chunk were lost.

The search engine usually contributes no additional semantic data toward the information acquisition process. This paper presents an intelligent search agent ""Web host access tool"" (WHAT) based on support vector machines (SVM), which introduces the notion of queries conducted within a specific contextual meaning. Given a context and associated keywords that personalize the search history and preferences of the user, WHAT performs more intelligent resource filtering than conventional search engines, providing more relevant results while filtering the irrelevant references. Search results obtained in the form of text from different search engines are processed by the SVM based word classifier that arrange the results obtained according to user preference obtained from previous search processes. The text materials are processed by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for creating a document matrix that gives the probability of a word occurrence in a specified context. For simplicity, this paper considers 5 different contexts: business, education, entertainment, news and information and tourism. The LSI coefficients were used by SVM to yield confidence levels for each search result and according to that the results were sorted and presented to the end user. As an alternative, least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) are also studied in this paper. The system is updated by the user that provides feedback regarding the search relevance, based on which the LSI coefficients are updated to ensure increased relevance in future searches. Three different types of kernel function were considered in this paper -Linear. Radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial kernel.

We propose to modify this picture: if the brain remembers by converging to the state representing familiar patterns, it should also diverge from such states when presented with an unknown encoded representation of a visual image. We propose to capture this behavior using a nonlinear line attractor network. This model encapsulates attractive fixed points scattered in the state space representing patterns with similar characteristics as an attractive curved line. The dynamics of the nonlinear line attractor network is designed such that when the network is able to reach equilibrium (stable), the input is considered as one of the stored patterns. Conversely, when the network is unable to reach equilibrium (unstable), the input is considered to be dissimilar to the stored patterns and therefore is considered as pattern of another class. Several experiments on benchmark problems have shown that the proposed model can be very useful for discriminating patterns.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:0-7803-9490-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716545","","Animals;Associative memory;Chaos;Convergence;Image converters;Information retrieval;Neurons;Recurrent neural networks;Scattering;State-space methods","brain;cognition;neurophysiology;nonlinear dynamical systems;recurrent neural nets;state-space methods;visual perception","brain;convergence;divergence dynamics;nonlinear line attractor network;recurrent neural network;state space method;visual image","","0","","11","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Offering reliable novel services in modern heterogeneous networks is a key challenge and an important prospective income source for many network operators and providers. Providing reliable future services in a cost effective scalable manner requires efficient use of networking and computation resources. This can be done by making the network more self-enabled, i.e. making it capable of making distributed local decisions regarding the utilization of the available resource. However, such decisions must be correlated in order to achieve a global overall goal (maximum utilization or maximum profit, for example). A key building block for all such systems is the ability to monitor the network parameters and the relevant traffic, and to infer from these measurements the relevant information needed in each one of the local decision points. Due to the heterogeneous nature of modern networks and to the very high amount of traffic, even monitoring a local location introduces significant difficulties. It is much more challenging to decide what type of traffic or network information should be collected at each network segment in order to acquire the needed global information without investing too much effort in the monitoring process or its management. In fact, efficient network and traffic monitoring may become a very significant ingredient in the ability to provide modern network services in a cost effective way. This tutorial deals with practical and efficient techniques to retrieve information from modern network devices. We start by examining the SNMP suit and the various methods to collect information from possibly large MIB tables. Then we develop a framework for quantifying resource (bandwidth and CPU) utilization in distributed network management. To demonstrate the practical impact of this framework, advanced techniques for efficient reactive traffic monitoring, efficient QoS parameter monitoring, and multimedia application monitoring, together- - with empirical results showing the overhead reduction will be presented. The tutorial continues with an example for a reliable, efficiency aware monitoring system that combines the above techniques with the SNMP framework, and time allowing novel techniques for efficient statistical monitoring","1542-1201;15421201","POD:1-4244-0142-9","10.1109/NOMS.2006.1687595","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1687595","","Bandwidth;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Costs;Information retrieval;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic","computer network management;monitoring;multimedia communication;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic","QoS parameter monitoring;distributed network management;heterogeneous networks;multimedia application monitoring;network information;network parameters;resource utilization;statistical monitoring;traffic monitoring","","0","","","","","3-7 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present an algorithm for establishing private communications in tuple-space systems using capabilities. In view of the fact that open systems need to be scalable, capabilities may provide a finer control to the loose control coordination of tuple-space systems whilst maintaining their flexibility.

The first problem is known as the detection or the order estimation and the second one as the resolution. For the resolution problem techniques such as nonlinear least squares (NLSM), high-order Yule-Walker method (HOYW), multiple signal classification (MUSIC), Pisarenko harmonic retrieval method, min-norm method, estimation of signal parameters by rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT), were proposed (Marple, 1987 and Stoica and Moses, 1997). All these high-resolution methods are based on the analysis of the signal covariance matrix. But the covariance matrix is not the only choice to represent the signal spectrum. In different applications (weather radars, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal processing, ultrasound imaging in medicine, atmospheric turbulence measurements) the signal spectrum can be modeled through its algebraic moments. Recently a number of efficient nonparametric methods have been proposed to estimate the algebraic spectral moments (Monakov, 1999). The presented paper is an attempt to solve the direction of arrival (DOA) problem via estimation of the algebraic spectral moments. A method proposed in the article is comparable in its accuracy with the MUSIC method. At the same time its computational burden is much lower.

In each iteration a comparatively small batch of documents is evaluated for relating to the human interesting. We applied active learning techniques based on support vector machine for evaluating successive batches, which is called relevance feedback. Our proposed approach has been very useful for document retrieval with relevance feedback experimentally. The traditional relevance feedback needs a set of relevant and non-relevant documents to work usefully. However, the initial retrieved documents, which are displayed to a user, sometimes don't include relevant documents. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new feedback method using information of non-relevant documents only. We named this method non-relevance feedback document retrieval.

The schemes are flexible for fusing diverse visual features and multiple modalities. The discriminative learning can automatically weight the most important features for the classification.

By using the created server components, a web application has been developed to demonstrate how to make the fuzzy image-segmentation service highly available through the Internet. Furthermore, by exploiting the same architecture seen for the Isocontour algorithm, a remote content-based retrieval service for image databases was implemented in order to show the adaptability of this web-based system.

Optical and analog circuit implementations are discussed and the CVN is shown to be very attractive for optical implementation since optical computations are naturally complex. The cost of the CVN is less in all cases than the traditional neuron when implemented optically.

The method is based on the idea of performing automatic annotation by imitating annotation examples of images with similar visual scene. It can make full use of both correlation of annotation words and context of image regions in same image. Given an input image, the most visual similar images are retrieved from the annotated images. The annotation words of the retrieved images can be used as the annotation of the input image. From this view, we can say traditional techniques of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) are more apt to the task of automatic image annotation. As an example-based machine translation method, the judgment of visual similarity between images plays an import role. Earth mover's distance (EMD) is chosen as similarity measure for visual features. In order to make the EMD favor the similar regions between images, an enhanced EMD is presented. The approach does not rely on clustering and consequently does not suffer from the granularity issues. Experiment results show that the proposed mechanism outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in annotating a large image collection using the same data set and same feature representations","","POD:1-4244-0332-4","10.1109/WCICA.2006.1713911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1713911","example-based machine translation;image annotation;image retrieval","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Earth;Feature extraction;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Paper technology;Training data","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image matching;image retrieval;image segmentation;language translation;learning by example","Earth mover distance;automatic image annotation;content-based image retrieval;example-based machine translation;image regions;image visual similarity;similarity measure;visual features","","1","","11","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The capacity maximization and structure risk minimization are utilized to evaluate the quality of the clustering result via a trade-off between the number of unreliable data points and model complexity (i.e. cluster number). The weighting factor for neighborhood effect is adaptive to the image content. It enhances the smoothness towards piecewise-homogeneous region and reduces the edge-blurring effect.
