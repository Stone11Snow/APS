"Load balancing for privacy-preserving access to big data in cloud","P. Li; S.

However, security and privacy issues become major concerns because third-party cloud service providers are not always trusty. Although data contents can be protected by encryption, the access patterns that contain important information are still exposed to clouds or malicious attackers. In this paper, we apply the ORAM algorithm to enable privacy-preserving access to big data that are deployed in distributed file systems built upon hundreds or thousands of servers in a single or multiple geo-distributed cloud sites. Since the ORAM algorithm would lead to serious access load unbalance among storage servers, we study a data placement problem to achieve a load balanced storage system with improved availability and responsiveness. Due to the NP-hardness of this problem, we propose a low-complexity algorithm that can deal with large-scale problem size with respect to big data. Extensive simulations are conducted to show that our proposed algorithm finds results close to the optimal solution, and significantly outperforms a random data placement algorithm.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3088-3; POD:978-1-4799-3089-0","10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849286","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849286","","Big data;Cloud computing;Conferences;Data privacy;Random access memory;Security;Servers","Big Data;cloud computing;computational complexity;data protection;distributed databases;file servers;information retrieval;random processes;resource allocation;storage management","Big Data;NP-hardness;ORAM algorithm;cloud storage;data availability;data content protection;data maintenance cost reduction;data management;data placement problem;data security;distributed file system;encryption;file server;geo-distributed cloud site;load balanced storage system;low-complexity algorithm;privacy preserving access;random data placement algorithm;responsiveness;storage server","","1","","18","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Internet of Things (IoT) concept envisions scenarios in which “smart objects” can be interconnected to enable a whole new class of applications and services, positively increasing the impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Although ICN tested scenarios have been mainly limited to multimedia and data, quoted advantages of ICN make from this architectural design a valuable approach in addressing the challenges that arise from the increasing deployment of IoT. In general, IoT applications impose stringent requirements in terms of information freshness, which can be highly impacted by the intrinsic caching mechanisms existing in ICN approaches. In the present work, the available freshness mechanism conceived as part of the Content-Centric Networking (CCN) protocol is assessed and a novel consumer driven information freshness approach is proposed to satisfy the consumers' needs while mitigating the negative effect of the freshness requirements in the overall network performance. The new mechanism was evaluated through simulation, with obtained results showing that the proposed approach leads to better performance, as compared with the available CCN freshness mechanism.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3088-3; POD:978-1-4799-3089-0","10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849279","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849279","Caching;Information Centric Networking;Information Freshness;Internet of Things","Communities;Conferences;Internet;Protocols;Simulation;Vehicles;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;content management;information retrieval;multimedia computing;protocols","CCN protocol;ICN approach;ICT;Internet;Internet of Things;IoT applications;consumer driven information freshness approach;content centric networking;content-centric networking protocol;information and communication technologies;information-centric networking approach;packet delivery;smart objects","","3","","23","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given a 3D model, three canonical planes define the normalized pose. We characterize the first canonical plane by an efficient computation of the dominant partial symmetry, using an efficient face matching approach. An algorithm based on minimizing the projection area determines the two relative remaining planes.

Nodes produce data with an associated value, decaying in time. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is sent to retrieve information from the nodes, through optical communication, and periodically emerges to deliver the collected data to a sink, located on the surface or onshore. Our objective is to determine a collection path for the AUV so that the Value of Information (VoI) of the data delivered to the sink is maximized. To this purpose, we first define an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model for path planning that considers realistic data communication rates, distances, and surfacing constraints. We then define the first heuristic for path finding that is adaptive to the occurrence of new events, relying only on acoustic communication for exchanging short control messages. Our Greedy and Adaptive AUV Path-finding (GAAP) heuristic drives the AUV to collect packets from nodes to maximize the VoI of the delivered data. We compare the VoI of data obtained by running the optimum solution derived by the ILP model to that obtained from running GAAP over UWSNs with realistic and desirable size. In our experiments GAAP consistently delivers more than 80% of the theoretical maximum VoI determined by the ILP model.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3360-0; POD:978-1-4799-3361-7","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848028","","Acoustics;Monitoring;Optimized production technology;Path planning;Silicon;Underwater vehicles;Videos","autonomous underwater vehicles;information retrieval;integer programming;linear programming;path planning;underwater acoustic communication;video surveillance","GAAP;ILP;UWSN;Value of Information;VoI;autonomous underwater vehicle;data communication;greedy and adaptive AUV path finding;information retrieval;integer linear programming;optical communication;path planning;sensed information;submarine monitoring;submarine surveillance;underwater wireless sensor networks","","16","","20","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We derive a novel concave modified logistic log-likelihood function which lower-bounds TWV. We then use a manifold-regularized kernel classifier that maximizes this lower-bound. A manifold regularization term in our objective function uses available unlabeled speech data and makes our approach semi-supervised. This term is particularly useful for KWS in low-resource languages and ensures that the predicted keyword confidence scores are smooth on a low-dimensional manifold in the feature space. We conduct KWS experiments on the IARPA Babel Vietnamese task and show performance improvements in terms of the maximum TWV (MTWV).

The On Fly Search (OFS) method has been proposed to make the system suitable for all the users and thus helps the users to search the compact storage structures without any knowledge about the content or about the path of the query. It also extends to support the auto complete method for multiple keyword queries. The typographical errors in the query are removed by the usage of fuzzy logic techniques. The effective Indexing Structure in QUICX helps to retrieve the data efficiently from the compact storage structure. The radix trie data structure, ranking function and inverted indexing has been used to have effective on fly search and to retrieve the top k results.

However, it is difficult to assess the applicability, expected performance and thus cost-effectiveness of a specific tool in a specific task context. We propose the introduction of a task-based approach in the domain of multimedia analysis, in order to assess the practical value of automatic information extraction tools for media production tasks. Using formalized machine readable models of these tasks, multimedia analysis tools can be assessed in the context of a real media production workflow rather than evaluating these tools in an isolated lab setting. We model dependencies of the performance of analysis tools on their input using a Bayesian network, and show that we obtain a better measure for the quality of the analysis results from this particular tool than with generic metrics. We also show that the method can be used for performance prediction based on content properties. The second contribution of this paper is the application of task models for cost simulation, comparing the effort of manual correction of results generated by automatic content analysis tools at different performance levels with a fully manual completion of the task. This enables determining a minimum performance level for cost-effective application of the automatic tools.","1949-3983;19493983","Electronic:978-1-4799-3990-9; POD:978-1-4799-3991-6; USB:978-1-4799-3989-3","10.1109/CBMI.2014.6849826","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849826","","Analytical models;Bayes methods;Benchmark testing;Context;Correlation;Media;Production","Bayes methods;content management;information retrieval;meta data;multimedia computing;software tools","Bayesian network;automatic content analysis tools;automatic information extraction tools;automatic metadata extraction tools;automatic tools;cost simulation;media production processes;media production tasks;media production workflow;multimedia analysis tools;task models","","0","","9","","","18-20 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To assist contents search for mobile users, in our previous work, we proposed a contents search system that presents a few options that enable user to get desired contents easily according to their situations. However, in this system, we manually constructed a tree structured ontology which is used for the system to infer user's situation and search objective based on sensory data. Thus, it was difficult to handle a large number of situations and could not guarantee the accuracy of the constructed ontology. To solve these problems, in this paper, we extend our system to automatically learn the relationships between user context and information needs by using a Bayesian network.

The improvement obtained is often rather small, however the structure and the relations between words obtained through parsing can be of great interest for the SLU processes, even without a significant decrease of WER. That is why we adopt another point of view in this paper: considering that ASR transcriptions contain inevitably some errors, we show in this study that it is possible to improve the syntactic analysis of these erroneous transcriptions by performing a joint error detection / syntactic parsing process.

The correspondence problem is especially challenging when the objects under consideration are suspect to non-rigid deformations, noise and/or distortions. In this paper, a novel method using Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) is presented to address this issue. In our QPSO-GA algorithm we formulate the problem of correspondence detection as an optimization problem over all possible mapping in between the geodesic distance matrices associated with two sets of point clouds. We proceed to identify the optimal mapping, by first applying Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization to the permutation matrices associated with their geodesic distance matrices and then employing Genetic Algorithms in order to guide the search. Experimental results suggest that our QPSO-GA algorithm is fast, scalable, and robust. Our method accurately identifies the correspondences between objects, even in the presence of noise and distortion.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3019-7; Electronic:978-1-4799-3020-3; POD:978-1-4799-3021-0","10.1109/INISTA.2014.6873622","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873622","Correspondence;Genetic Algorithm Quantum;Isometry;Markovian Process;Mutation;Non-Rigid Deformable Objects;Particle Swarm Optimization","Equations;Genetic algorithms;Linear programming;Mathematical model;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Shape","computer animation;genetic algorithms;information retrieval;particle swarm optimisation","GA;QPSO;computer animation experts;correspondence problem;deformable objects;genetic algorithm approach;geodesic distance matrices;information retrieval;morph shapes;optimization problem;quantum particle swarm optimization","","0","","22","","","23-25 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an integrated object placement and movement framework and adaptive learning algorithms to address these issues. Specifically, we present a method that shuffle data objects across storage tiers to optimize the data access performance. The method also integrates an adaptive learning algorithm where realtime classification is employed to predict the popularity of data object accesses, so that they can be placed on, or migrate between SSD or HDD drives in the most efficient manner.

On the other, enterprise process information is spread over various sources like shared drives, databases, and enterprise information systems. As a consequence, users often manually link process information with particular process objects (e.g., using process portals). What is needed instead, however is an integrated access to both processes and related enterprise process information. This paper establishes such a link by introducing an integrated navigation space for process model collections and related enterprise process information. In particular, this navigation space allows process participants to flexibly navigate within process model collections, single process models, and related process information. In turn, this enables advanced end-user support for process repositories.","2151-1349;21511349","Electronic:978-1-4799-2393-9; POD:978-1-4799-2394-6","10.1109/RCIS.2014.6861039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6861039","Business Process Management;Process Navigation;Process Visualization","Automotive engineering;Context;Guidelines;Information systems;Navigation;Semantics;Silicon compounds","information management;information retrieval;information systems;portals","business process;end-user support;enterprise process information;integrated navigation space;navigation space;process management technology;process model collections;process model repositories;process-aware information systems","","0","","46","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, due to feasibility, ethical and legal reasons, developers not always have access to real data or the possibility of testing solutions in a real environment. Moreover, the network workflows can include distinct usage profiles, which can change between institutions. So, developers have to fall back on simulation, which leads to the problem of obtaining message exchange flow data.

Furthermore, text information is usually encrypted before being outsourced to data centers in order to protect users' data privacy. Current techniques to search on encrypted data do not perform well within such a massive data environment. In this paper, a hierarchical clustering method for ciphertext search within a big data environment is proposed. The proposed approach clusters the documents based on the minimum similarity threshold, and then partitions the resultant clusters into sub-clusters until the constraint on the maximum size of cluster is reached. In the search phase, this approach can reach a linear computational complexity against exponential size of document collection. In addition, retrieved documents have a better relationship with each other than traditional methods. An experiment has been conducted using the collection set built from the recent ten years' IEEE INFOCOM publications, including about 3000 documents with nearly 5300 keywords.

However, as the data growing rapidly in data centers, single-node storage node is no longer be able to provide the corresponding throughput and capacities as expected. Building deduplication clusters is considered as a promising strategy to leverage such bottle-neck on single-node system. However, deduplication relies on how much the system knows about information of previous stored data. The single-node system obviously obtains all such information and is able to detect duplicate data there; however storage nodes in cluster-based system cannot know information on other nodes. It is nontrivial to route data intelligently enough so that the system could support deduplication performance comparable to that of a single-node system, while also at a trivial cost. In this paper, we propose an elastic data routing strategy, aiming to achieve deduplication performance comparable to state-of-the-art, while require much less computation resources.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3088-3; POD:978-1-4799-3089-0","10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849183","","Computers;Educational institutions;Indexes;Internet;Load management;Routing;Software","computer centres;information retrieval systems;pattern clustering;storage management","cluster-based deduplication systems;data archive;data backup;data centers;data deduplication;deduplication clusters;duplicate data detection;elastic data routing strategy;single-node storage node;space-efficient approach;storage systems","","0","","10","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reconstructing accurate ground truth is more complicated when sources are polarized. The paper describes an algorithm that significantly improves the quality of reconstruction results in the presence of polarized sources. For evaluation, we recorded human observations from Twitter for four months during a recent Egyptian uprising against the former president. We then used our algorithm to reconstruct a version of events and compared it to other versions produced by state of the art algorithms. Our analysis of the data set shows the presence of two clearly defined camps in the social network that tend of propagate largely disjoint sets of claims (which is indicative of polarization), as well as third population whose claims overlap subsets of the former two. Experiments show that, in the presence of polarization, our reconstruction tends to align more closely with ground truth in the physical world than the existing algorithms.","2325-2936;23252936","Electronic:978-1-4799-4618-1; POD:978-1-4799-4617-4","10.1109/DCOSS.2014.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846147","Community Polarization;Crowd-sensing;Fact-finders;Social Networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Estimation;Reliability;Sensors;Twitter;Vectors","information retrieval;social networking (online)","Egyptian uprising;Twitter;crowd-sensing applications;ground truth reconstruction;information reporting;polarized sources;social network","","4","","23","","","26-28 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Good representations are an important requirement for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks to be performed successfully. However, a major problem with neural networks is that training time becomes prohibitive for very large datasets and the learning algorithm can get stuck in local minima for very deep and wide network architectures. In this paper we examine 3 ways to improve feature learning for audio data using neural networks: 1.using Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) instead of standard sigmoid units; 2.using a powerful regularisation technique called Dropout; 3.using Hessian-Free (HF) optimisation to improve training of sigmoid nets. We show that these methods provide significant improvements in training time and the features learnt are better than state of the art handcrafted features, with a genre classification accuracy of 83 ± 1.1% on the Tzanetakis (GTZAN) dataset. We found that the rectifier networks learnt better features than the sigmoid networks. We also demonstrate the capacity of the features to capture relevant information from audio data by applying them to genre classification on the ISMIR 2004 dataset.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4799-2893-4; POD:978-1-4799-2894-1; USB:978-1-4799-2892-7","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854949","Deep Learning;MIR;Neural Networks","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Hafnium;Neural networks;Optimization;Training;Training data","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);music;neural nets","Dropout;GTZAN dataset;HF optimisation;Hessian-free optimisation;MIR tasks;ReLU;Tzanetakis dataset;audio data;deep neural networks;feature learning;genre classification;music feature learning;music information retrieval;neural network training;rectified linear units;rectifier networks;regularisation technique;sigmoid nets;training time","","6","","24","","","4-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, we also estimate their influences across different websites outside the major hosting website. Web video is gaining significance due to its rich and eye-ball grabbing content. This phenomenon is evidently amplified and accelerated by the advance of Web 2.0. When a video receives some degree of popularity, it tends to appear on various websites including not only video-sharing websites but also news websites, social networks or even Wikipedia. Numerous video-sharing websites have hosted videos that reached a phenomenal level of visibility and popularity in the entire cyberspace. As a result, it is becoming more difficult to determine how the propagation took place - was the video a piece of original work that was intentionally uploaded to its major hosting site by the authors, or did the video originate from some small site then reached the sharing site after already getting a good level of popularity, or did it originate from other places in the cyberspace but the sharing site made it popular. Existing study regarding this flow of influence is lacking. Literature that discuss the problem of estimating a video's influence in the whole cyberspace also remains rare. In this article we introduce a novel framework to identify the propagation of popular videos from its major hosting site's perspective, and to estimate its influence. We define a Unified Virtual Community Space (UVCS) to model the propagation and influence of a video, and devise a novel learning method called Noise-reductive Local-and-Global Learning (NLGL) to effectively estimate a video's origin and influence. Without losing generality, we conduct experiments on annotated dataset collected from a major video sharing site to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework. - urrounding the collected videos and their ranks, some interesting discussions regarding the propagation and influence of videos as well as user behavior are also presented.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6583164","Clustering;Data mining;Modeling structured;Video influence estimation;and association rules;classification;textual and multimedia data;unified virtual community space;video origin estimation","Communities;Cyberspace;Encyclopedias;Internet;Social network services;Videos","Internet;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);social aspects of automation","NLGL method;UVCS;Web 2.0;Web site;Web videos;Wikipedia;cyberspace;influence propagation;news Web sites;noise-reductive local-and-global learning method;popularity degree;social networks;unified virtual community space;user behavior;video analysis;video-sharing Web sites","","2","","35","","20130821","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As the meaning of a discourse can be completely distorted by negations, the correct identification of terms vs negated terms is mandatory. Our work is an attempt of automated negation identification in unstructured health records. We analyzed a corpus of medical documents containing 5103 sentences and we found that while adverbs have a distribution of 3%, the negation covers almost 2% of the words used in the corpus, justifying an in depth analysis of negation. The main contribution of the paper addresses the existing drawback of negation identification approaches in the literature that do not consider negation represented with negation prefixes. In this paper we address the tasks of syntactic and morphologic negation identification. In order to identify morphologic negation we propose the PreNex algorithm that consists in breaking down the terms into prefix and root word and the analysis of the root's validity using additional available resources (WordNet). The syntactic negation identification relies on a pattern matching approach where the negated concepts are identified based on a predefined Ust of negation identifiers. The results we obtained are promising and ensure a reliable negation identification approach for medical documents. We report a precision of 92.62% and recall of 93.60% in case of the morphologic negation identification and an overall performance in the morphologic and syntactic negation identification of 95.96% precision and 94.23% recall.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3732-5; POD:978-1-4799-3733-2; USB:978-1-4799-3730-1","10.1109/AQTR.2014.6857880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857880","Electronic Health Records;Text Mining;WordNet;negation identification;prefix","Algorithm design and analysis;Compounds;Lead;Medical diagnostic imaging;Semantics;Surgery;Text mining","document handling;electronic health records;information retrieval;knowledge acquisition;pattern matching","PreNex algorithm;discourse meaning;electronic health records;knowledge extraction process;medical documents;morphologic negation identification;negation identification approach;pattern matching approach;syntactic negation identification;topic extraction;word meaning","","0","","16","","","22-24 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One EPICS data archive system is necessary to be developed to record various machine parameters and status information for long time logging. An archive engine takes PV data from EPICS IOCs via channel access, and stores them in the data storage. The PostgreSQL RDB (Relational Database) was adopted as the data storage for the TPS archive system. Both the historic PVs (Process Variable) data and the archive engine configuration are saved into the same RDB. The archived data can be retrieved in the graphical user interface of data browser. Taking the performance and redundancy into considerations, the storage servers and RDB table structures are tuned relatively. The primary factor most common used to judge system performance is the mean response time. We propose the queueing model method to analyze the performance of a network-based archive system, and simplify the architecture as the queueing model in serial and parallel to derive the equations of mean response time. Then we apply the proposed method to estimate the approximate response time of the actual network-based system which constructed in serial and in parallel.

Surrounding the effective management of knowledge, the method for the retrieval of multi-level knowledge is developed including the process of retrieving, matching and assembling. Since the knowledge is stored in the form of a tree structure, the depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) are applied to the retrieval algorithm and similarity is used to calculate the match degree. The framework is implemented in the development of an example missile, which demonstrates that its useful for the re-use of design knowledge.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3776-9; POD:978-1-4799-3777-6; USB:978-1-4799-3775-2","10.1109/CSCWD.2014.6846846","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846846","Base Object Model;Complex Product;Knowledge Reuse;Multi-level","Algorithm design and analysis;Bills of materials;Computational modeling;Computers;Knowledge engineering;Missiles;Semantics","Web services;XML;information retrieval;knowledge management;knowledge representation;meta data;product design;product development;production engineering computing;tree data structures;tree searching","BFS;BOM;DFS;Web service;XML document;assembling process;base object model;behavioral information;breadth first search;complex product design;complex product development;depth first search;design knowledge management;functional information;match degree calculation;matching process;metadata;multilevel knowledge representation;multilevel knowledge retrieval;structural information;tree structure","","0","","12","","","21-23 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aggregation process is often implemented with Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) processes. Usually ETL processes require information for aggregation available in structured formats, e. g.

Due to the fact that information is provided in natural language, Information Extraction (IE) systems have been evolved. They make use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to derive meaning from natural language text. State-of-the-art NLP tools apply Machine Learning methods. These NLP tools perform on newspapers with good quality, but they drop accuracy in other domains. However, to improve the quality for IE systems in specific domains often NLP tools are trained on domain specific text which is a time consuming process.

We have proposed a notion of website segment which groups the related web pages from their same longest directory paths. Rather than exploring a target web page as proposed in many traditional focused crawling approaches, we train an ensemble classifier with several features to predict the relevancy of the website segments. The most relevant website segments in the crawling frontier are then enqueued to download.

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing n-gram approaches simply break pay-load into equal-length pieces and are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing n-gram approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3360-0; POD:978-1-4799-3361-7","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848073","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","computer network management;computer network security;feature extraction;information retrieval;protocols;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning;word processing","ProWord;byte subsequences;deep packet analysis;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram approach;network management;nontrivial algorithm;protocol feature word extraction;ranking algorithm;security system;statistical structure;traffic payload;traffic trace;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting expert algorithm","","8","","27","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, NOSes are required to exchange reachability and topology information between the inter-domain networks. How such information is efficiently exchanged has not been well addressed so far. Thus, this demo proposes a West-East Bridge (WE-Bridge) mechanism for different SDN administrative domains to peer and cooperate with each other: (1) we design a peer-to-peer based high performance network information exchange mechanism. We define what network information should be exchanged and how such information is efficiently exchanged among inter-domain SDN peers. (2) To achieve a resilient peer-to-peer control plane of heterogeneous NOSes, we propose a `maximum connection degree' based connection algorithm [4]. (3) Considering the privacy, we propose to virtualize the SDN network view, and only exchange the virtualized network view to construct the relative global network view.

The scheduler dedicates sequences of consecutive timeslots of an AP to downloading a data item to a client during the time window in which it is in range, which corresponds to assigning a job (the client's download) to a machine (the AP) among many. The transmission rate chosen for each assignment partly corresponds to setting a machine's speed, but it also has subtler effects. The APs may control transmission power to tune its transmission range making sure that no interference occurs with neighboring APs' transmissions. The problem is a generalization of an already NP-hard parallel-machine scheduling problem in which jobs' release times and deadlines depend on the machine to which they are assigned. We define this joint timeslot, power control, and rate assignment problem formally and apply both new algorithms and adaptations of existing algorithms to it. We evaluate these algorithms through simulations which show that our proposed algorithms achieve near-optimal throughput.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2315196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6782418","Interference;machine;mobility;networks;optimization;power control;resource allocation;scheduling;sensor;transmission control;wireless","IP networks;Interference;Mobile communication;Power control;Throughput;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","information retrieval;mobile radio;optimisation;power control;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","AP;NP-hard parallel-machine scheduling problem;data access points;data dissemination scenario;mobile WSN scheduling;mobile clients;network throughput maximization;transmission power control;transmission rate","","5","","23","","20140402","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The segments of the audio files are given as a query to the system. These segments are the audio pieces range between 1 to 2 seconds. Use of segments is preferred over original file because of their smile sizes, to reduce the system complexity. Using the system, duplicity of two files is decided by the similarity between their feature matrices. The system is purely application driven and does not depend on the particular audio characteristics. Experiments are done on the large audio databases and system is evaluated accordingly.

The paper describes the key components of one solution to this problem, and briefly overviews the naive Bayes classifier that is the basis of the solution. The discussion is focused on feature selection and example representation which were the key challenges to be addressed during the development of this classifier. We also analyze the effect of the number of features on accuracy, training and classification time and the size of the resulting classifier and the representation of the training examples which were all important characteristics for the competition.

Most such contents are multimedia items which are user-generated, i.e., posted online by the contents' owners. In this paper we focus on how those who provide contents can leverage online platforms in order to profit from their large base of potential viewers. Actually, platforms like Vimeo or YouTube provide tools to accelerate the dissemination of contents, i.e., recommendation lists and other re-ranking mechanisms. Hence, the popularity of a content can be increased by paying a cost for advertisement: doing so, it will appear with some priority in the recommendation lists and will be accessed more frequently by the platform users. Ultimately, such acceleration mechanism engenders a competition among online contents to gain popularity. In this context, our focus is on the structure of the acceleration strategies which a content provider should use in order to optimally promote a content given a certain daily budget. Such a best response indeed depends on the strategies adopted by competing content providers. Also, it is a function of the potential popularity of a content and the fee paid for the platform advertisement service. We formulate the problem as a differential game and we solve it for the infinite horizon case by deriving the structure of certain Nash equilibria of the game.","","Electronic:978-3-901882-58-6; POD:978-1-4799-3368-6; USB:978-3-901882-59-3","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2014.6857098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857098","Acceleration;Best Response;Content Popularity;Differential Games;Nash Equilibria","Acceleration;Approximation methods;Cost function;Games;Switches;Videos;YouTube","Internet;advertising data processing;content management;differential games;information dissemination;information retrieval;multimedia systems;recommender systems;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;Nash equilibria;acceleration strategy;advertisement service;content dissemination;content provider;differential games;multimedia content;online content access;online content diffusion;online contents;re-ranking mechanism;recommendation list;user generated content","","1","","17","","","2-4 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We define a conceptual framework, a semantics extraction algorithm, and a first proof of concept applying the algorithm to a small set of Wikipedia documents. Intended as an extension to the prevailing top-down ontologies, we introduce an inductive fuzzy grassroots ontology, which organizes itself organically from existing natural language Web content. Using inductive and approximate reasoning to reflect the natural way in which knowledge is processed, the ontology's bottom-up build process creates emergent semantics learned from the Web. By this means, the ontology acts as a hub for computing with words described in natural language. For Web users, the structural semantics are visualized as inductive fuzzy cognitive maps, allowing an initial form of intelligence amplification. Eventually, we present an implementation of our inductive fuzzy grassroots ontology. Thus, this paper contributes an algorithm for the extraction of fuzzy grassroots ontologies from Web data by inductive fuzzy classification.","2154-0357;21540357","Electronic:978-1-4673-5208-6; POD:978-1-4673-5209-3","10.1109/EIT.2013.6857939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857939","","Cognition;Data mining;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Semantics","Internet;fuzzy reasoning;information retrieval;knowledge representation;natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","Web data;approximate reasoning;deductive reasoning;inductive fuzzy classification;inductive fuzzy cognitive maps;inductive fuzzy grassroot ontology;inductive reasoning;intelligence amplification;knowledge processing;knowledge representation;natural language Web content;semantic extraction algorithm;structural semantic visualization","","1","","","","","9-11 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a two phase process that we get the initial relevance score based on the method of pair wise random walk along given meta-paths, which is a meta-level description of the path instances in heterogeneous information networks, and then take user preference into consideration to calculate the weights combination of meta-paths and model the problem into a multi-objective linear planning problem which can be solved with the method of generic algorithm. Besides, to ensure the efficiency, we use matrix computation and selective materialization to avoid the recursive computation of pair wise random walk. What's more, we propose an effective pruning method to skip unnecessary objects computations. The experiments on IMDB and DBLP dataset show that the method can gain a better accuracy and efficiency.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3776-9; POD:978-1-4799-3777-6; USB:978-1-4799-3775-2","10.1109/CSCWD.2014.6846859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846859","Heterogeneous information networks;graph partitioning;relevance search;user-preference search","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Computer science;Educational institutions;Motion pictures;Planning;Search problems","information networks;information retrieval;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;recommender systems","DBLP dataset;IMDB dataset;anomaly detection;clustering;generic algorithm;heterogeneous information network;matrix computation;meta-level description;meta-path selection integration;multiobjective linear planning problem;pair wise random walk recursive computation;path instances;pruning method;recommendation;relevance score;selective materialization;top-k most relevant objects;top-k relevant search;two phase process;user-preference","","1","","15","","","21-23 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Protecting your right: Attribute-based keyword search with fine-grained owner-enforced search authorization in the cloud","W. Sun; S. Yu; W. Lou; Y. T. Hou; H.

Many secure search schemes have been focusing on the single-contributor scenario, where the outsourced dataset or the secure searchable index of the dataset are encrypted and managed by a single owner, typically based on symmetric cryptography. In this paper, we focus on a different yet more challenging scenario where the outsourced dataset can be contributed from multiple owners and are searchable by multiple users, i.e. multi-user multi-contributor case. Inspired by attribute-based encryption (ABE), we present the first attribute-based keyword search scheme with efficient user revocation (ABKS-UR) that enables scalable fine-grained (i.e. file-level) search authorization. Our scheme allows multiple owners to encrypt and outsource their data to the cloud server independently. Users can generate their own search capabilities without relying on an always online trusted authority. Fine-grained search authorization is also implemented by the owner-enforced access policy on the index of each file. Further, by incorporating proxy re-encryption and lazy re-encryption techniques, we are able to delegate heavy system update workload during user revocation to the resourceful semi-trusted cloud server. We formalize the security definition and prove the proposed ABKS-UR scheme selectively secure against chosen-keyword attack. Finally, performance evaluation shows the efficiency of our scheme.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3360-0; POD:978-1-4799-3361-7","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847943","","Authorization;Data privacy;Encryption;Indexes;Keyword search;Servers","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;information retrieval;trusted computing","ABE;ABKS-UR scheme;always online trusted authority;attribute-based encryption;attribute-based keyword search;chosen-keyword attack;cloud computing;cloud server environment;data privacy;encryption;encryption-before-outsourcing;fine-grained owner-enforced search authorization;lazy re-encryption technique;owner-enforced access policy;proxy re-encryption technique;resourceful semi-trusted cloud server;searchable index;security definition;single-contributor search scenario;symmetric cryptography;user revocation","","19","","29","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MAS can be defined as groups of entities (agents) working together to solve problems not solvable by their individual skills and know-how. Business decisions are based on extraction of useful knowledge from different data sources. Those data sources, usually called the big data, might be huge digital data sets such as an internal data warehouse or external sources like the web. In order to process the big data, one needs to have smart solutions, analytics services, programming tools and applications. Intelligent agents can perform certain tasks such as big data processing, information retrieval and the creation of OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) cubes which represent multidimensional data. Given that volumes of data grow continuously, insurance companies have to be able manage them. The agent technology has the potential to become the key technology for management of ever-increasing amount of information. This paper describes how to develop MAS in order to gather useful knowledge from the data source and automate the specific process for better business decision.","","CD-ROM:978-953-233-081-6; Electronic:978-953-233-077-9; POD:978-1-4799-5657-9","10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6859736","Artificial Intelligence;BI;Big Data;Business Intelligence;Decision Support;JADE;MAS;Multi Agent Systems;OLAP;On-Line Analytical Processing","Artificial intelligence;Containers;Databases;Organizations;Programming;Standards organizations","Big Data;Internet;artificial intelligence;data mining;data warehouses;decision support systems;information retrieval;insurance data processing;multi-agent systems","Big Data;MAS;OLAP;World Wide Web;analytics services;artificial intelligence;big data processing;business decisions;complex system;data source;decision support;information retrieval;insurance company;insurance industry;intelligent agents;intelligent multiagent system;internal data warehouse;knowledge extraction;multidimensional data;online analytical processing cubes;programming tools;smart solution","","0","","11","","","26-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the cloud cannot be fully trusted, the outsourced data should be encrypted. This however brings a range of problems, such as: How should a data owner grant search capabilities to the data users? How can the authorized data users search over a data owner's outsourced encrypted data? How can the data users be assured that the cloud faithfully executed the search operations on their behalf? Motivated by these questions, we propose a novel cryptographic solution, called verifiable attribute-based keyword search (VABKS). The solution allows a data user, whose credentials satisfy a data owner's access control policy, to (i) search over the data owner's outsourced encrypted data, (ii) outsource the tedious search operations to the cloud, and (iii) verify whether the cloud has faithfully executed the search operations. We formally define the security requirements of VA B K S and describe a construction that satisfies them.

Prior works have shown that these models obtain lower perplexity and word error rate (WER) compared to both standard n-gram language models (LMs) and more advanced language models including maximum entropy and random forest LMs. While these results are compelling, prior works were limited to evaluating NNLMs on perplexity and word error rate. Our initial results showed that while NNLMs improved speech recognition accuracy, the improvement in keyword search was negligible. In this paper we propose alternate optimizations of NNLMs for the task of keyword search. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods for keyword search on the Vietnamese dataset provided in phase one of the BABEL<sup>1</sup> project and demonstrate that by penalizing low frequency words during NNLM training, keyword search metrics such as actual term weighted value (ATWV) can be improved by up to 9.3% compared to the standard training methods.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4799-2893-4; POD:978-1-4799-2894-1; USB:978-1-4799-2892-7","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854531","keyword search;language modeling;neural networks","Artificial neural networks;Computational modeling;History;Keyword search;Speech recognition;Training","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;word processing","ATWV;BABEL project;NNLM training;Vietnamese dataset;actual term weighted value;keyword search metrics;neural network language model optimization","","1","","18","","","4-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
