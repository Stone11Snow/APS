"Effect of academic discipline on technology acceptance","R. O. Orji","Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada","2010 International Conference on Education and Management Technology","20101203","2010","","","617","621","One of the most dramatic changes in the last three decades has been the rapid development of Information Technology (IT). IT has gradually found its way into business, industry and into the classroom through computers and computer-related technologies. But, despite the heavy investment in IT, it has been observed that the existence of these technologies does not automatically translate to their acceptance. Hence, many models and theories have tried to explain the contributing factors in technology acceptance; however, most of these models and theories have focused on technology-related factors like ease of use, perceived usefulness and facilitating conditions. In this paper, we present user's academic discipline as a non technology-related factor that affects ITacceptance. We formulated a new model of technology acceptance - Academic Discipline based Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (ADUTAUT) adapted from UTAUT model. We validated the model on Electronic Library System (ELS) using 116 students of different academic disciplines with regards to their acceptance of the ELS and the factors that influences acceptance. The Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis shows that the variables influencing acceptance vary between the three academic disciplines considered (Art and Science, Engineering and Social Science.). This means that different academic discipline may have different effects on users' technology acceptance. This study is useful to school managers, bank managers and other IS designers that make decisions about IS that is used by people of different academic discipline.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8618-2; POD:978-1-4244-8616-8","10.1109/ICEMT.2010.5657581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657581","Academic Discipline;Digital Library;Information Retrieval;Structural Equation Model;Technology acceptance;UTAUT Model","Adaptation model;Art;Biological system modeling;Education;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Silicon","educational administrative data processing;information technology;social aspects of automation;user interfaces","IT;academic discipline;electronic library system;information technology;structural equation model;technology acceptance;unified acceptance theory","","1","","27","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since parallel sentence-aligned corpora are usually noisy due to inexact automatic methods when generated from parallel or comparable documents, we need to clean parallel corpora. In this paper, new features are introduced to assess the correctness of a sentence pair. Also, the impact of new features in combination with state-of-the-art features introduced in the literature is systematically evaluated. Statistical methods have been used for feature extraction and therefore this approach is independent to language. In order to better understand the problem characteristics, four supervised classification algorithms are used to classify sentence pairs as noise or parallel. Evaluating the models by taking accuracy and f-measure into account shows that using the system for cleaning a noisy parallel Farsi-English corpus, the maximum entropy model performs better than the main filtering techniques used in this paper and shows a significant improvement over two other systems.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8185-9; POD:978-1-4244-8183-5","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734083","Corpus Filtering;Cross Language Information Retrieval;Maximum Entropy;Statistical Machine Translation","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational linguistics;Entropy;Noise;Noise measurement;Training","language translation;maximum entropy methods;pattern classification;statistical analysis","F-measurement;bilingual corpora;discriminative approach;maximum entropy model;noisy parallel Farsi-English corpus;noisy sentence pairs;parallel sentence-aligned corpora;sentence pair correctness;statistical machine translation models;statistical methods;supervised classification algorithms","","2","","25","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this aspect web search engine gives sets of relevant documents related to user query. Thereby user has to scan all searched documents and read line by line to get specific answer. So there is great need to automate the overall process, so that user gets answer in the form of compact text along with map for visualization purpose. This aims at developing geographic domain question answering system [QAS] embedded with mapping abilities where our system will allow users to specify a location addition to the keywords they are searching for as a query.

Most of the information retrieval systems are limited to the query processing based on keywords. In information retrieval system the matching of the query against a set of text record is the core of the system. Retrieval of the relevant natural language text document is of more challenge. Today's most search engines are based on keyword based (bag of words) techniques, which results in some disadvantages. For text retrieval key phrases can help to narrow the search results or rank retrieved documents. We exploit shallow NLP techniques to support a range of NL queries and snippets over an existing keyword-based search. This paper describes a simple system for choosing noun phrases from a document as key phrases. The noun phrase extractor is made up of three modules: tokenization; part-of-speech tagging; noun phrase identification using Chunking. A preliminary evaluation was conducted to test this technique with the standard IR benchmark collections such as classic test collections and then with the web snippets collection from the search engines results. The experimental results have been encouraging.","2325-5919;23255919","Electronic:978-1-4244-9009-7; POD:978-1-4244-9007-3","10.1109/TISC.2010.5714612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714612","Chunking;Information Retrieval;NLP;Noun Phrases","Arrays;Data mining;Natural language processing;Search engines;Syntactics;Tagging","Internet;natural language processing;query processing;search engines","Internet;NLP techniques;chunking;information retrieval system;keyword based techniques;natural language text document;noun phrase extraction;part-of-speech tagging;query processing;search engines;tokenization","","3","","22","","","17-19 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be able to work efficiently under such circumstances, navigation in all available data needs support. Maintaining traceability links between software artifacts is one approach to structure the information space and support this challenge. Many researchers have proposed traceability recovery by applying information retrieval (IR) methods, utilizing the fact that artifacts often have textual content in natural language. Case studies have showed promising results, but no large-scale in vivo evaluations have been made. Currently, there is a trend among our industrial partners to move to a specific new software engineering tool. Their aim is to collect different pieces of information in one system. Our ambition is to develop an IR-based traceability recovery plug-in to this tool. From this position, right in the middle of a real industrial setting, many interesting observations could be made.

The proposed approach leverages a recently proposed song model that is based on a generative time series model of the musical content-the dynamic texture mixture (DTM) model-that treats fragments of audio as the output of a linear dynamical system. To model characteristic temporal dynamics and timbral content at the tag level, a novel, efficient, and hierarchical expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for DTM (HEM-DTM) is used to summarize the common information shared by DTMs modeling individual songs associated with a tag.

The search is usually guided by relevant keywords provided by the user. But the key words provided might belong to different domains and the search may end up giving results on domains where the users are not interested on. This paper proposes a novel information retrieval prototype by providing a personalized search interface. The interface is based on specific domain chosen by the user. The effectiveness of the search is brought by fragmenting the search criterion into different parameters or the features of that domain. The user is assisted to enter only domain specific keywords. This helps to retrieve only the relevant information belonging to the chosen domain. The user is also given the choice to select more than one search criteria to refine the search.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7818-7; POD:978-1-4244-7817-0","10.1109/CISIM.2010.5643453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5643453","fragmentation;information retrieval;interface;personalizaion;search","Cardiovascular diseases;Drugs;Google;Heart;History;Hospitals;Search engines","information retrieval;search engines;user interfaces","domain specific user interface;information retrieval;personalised user interface;search engine;specific domain","","0","","16","","","8-10 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, we propose a new similarity measure to compute the similarity of pages and apply it to partition a web database into several web social networks (WSNs). Secondly, we improve the traditional PageRank algorithm by taking into account the relevance of page to a given query. Thirdly, we design an efficient web crawler to download the web data.

The query exemplars are usually long and in the form of either a partial or even a full document. However, they may contain extraneous terms (or off-topic information) that would have a negative impact on the retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose to integrate extractive summarization techniques into the retrieval process so as to improve the informativeness of a verbose query exemplar. The original query exemplar is first divided into several sub-queries or sentences. To construct a new concise query exemplar, summarization techniques are then employed to select a salient subset of sub-queries.

The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object.

Analyzing patent information has, therefore, become a common task for many interest groups. As a prerequisite for patent analysis, extensive search for relevant patent information is essential. Unfortunately, the complexity of patent material inhibits a straightforward retrieval of all relevant patent documents and leads to iterative, time-consuming approaches in practice. Already the amount of patent data to be analyzed poses challenges with respect to scalability. Further scalability issues arise concerning the diversity of users and the large variety of analysis tasks. With ""PatViz”, a system for interactive analysis of patent information has been developed addressing scalability at various levels. PatViz provides a visual environment allowing for interactive reintegration of insights into subsequent search iterations, thereby bridging the gap between search and analytic processes.

Using the national domain such as .ae, .uk, as primary identifier and IP address, geographic locations, and language as augmented/secondary identifiers is no longer adequate. We propose a two-step Web page classifier (1) pre-crawl filter and (2) post-crawl filter. The former stage prunes out Web pages not belonging to the nation under investigation before fetching/downloading a Web page while the later stage filters irrelevant ones through a multiple-step analysis after downloading a page.

Users must either browse through a large hierarchy of concepts to find the information for which they are looking or submit a query to a publicly available search engine and wade through hundreds of results, most of them irrelevant. The core problem is that whether the user is browsing or searching, whether they are novice web users or experts, the identical information result is retrieved and presented commonly without any difference. The goal of Web search personalization is to tailor search results to a particular user based on that user's interests and preferences, thus allowing for more efficient and relevant information access. Personalization of information retrieval involves two major challenges: identifying the user context and organizing them in such a way that improves the search precision. This leads to the development of user profiles in a hierarchical structure namely ontology for user profiles. The main goal of this paper is to propose a technique that implicitly builds ontology-based user profiles. We build and update profiles dynamically by monitoring and storing the user's browsing habits.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8679-3; POD:978-1-4244-8678-6","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5942090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5942090","Personalization;User profiles;information retrieval;ontology;precision","Conferences;Context;Ontologies;Search engines;Semantics;Web search","Internet;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);search engines","Internet users;Web pages;Web search personalization;information retrieval;ontology based user profiles;search engine;user browsing habits;user context;user interests;user preferences","","0","","21","","","8-10 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Knowledge-Driven Architecture for Efficient Resource Discovery in P2P Networks","A. Eftychiou; B.

In this paper a more effective P2P architecture is presented, aiming to improve existing resource discovery processes. The proposed architecture is organised as a hierarchical super-peer structure, where super-peers of the network represent network's knowledge that is formalised dynamically using its peers' resources. The main focus of this paper is the creation of an adaptive hierarchical concept-based P2P topology using collective intelligence methods. In that process, unmanageable data is transformed into a structured knowledge based repository of semantic resources. Therefore, the network takes the form of an ontology of conceptually related entities of resource information, as provided by the peers. This knowledge driven approach has benefits over traditional load driven architectures, as the user query context is usually the main driver for managing the performance of the network, and in a way the network can be characterised as proactive rather than reactive. A number of experiments have been undertaken and results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed concept-based architecture over other popular architectures.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4278-2; POD:978-1-4244-8828-5","10.1109/INCOS.2010.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5702144","collective intelligence;distributed information retrieval;domain ontology;peer-to-peer (P2P) networks","","data mining;ontologies (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing;query processing","P2P network;collective intelligence method;hierarchical super peer structure;knowledge driven architecture;ontology;peer-to-peer network;resource discovery;user query","","0","","20","","","24-26 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tools incorporating IR have tackled problems, such as feature location, that previously required considerable human effort. However, to reap the full benefit of IR-based techniques, the language used across all software artifacts (e.g., requirement and design documents, test plans, as well as the source code) must be consistent. Vocabulary normalization aligns the vocabulary found in source code with that found in other software artifacts. Normalization both splits an identifier into its constituent parts and expands each part into a full dictionary word to match vocabulary in other artifacts. An algorithm for normalization is presented. Its current implementation incorporates a greatly improved splitter that exploits a collection of resources including several dictionaries, frequency distributions derived from the corpus of programs, and co-occurrence data. Empirical study of this new splitter, GenTest, on almost 8000 identifiers finds that it correctly splits 82%, outperforming the current state-of-the-art.

Whereas most MME research focuses on audio analysis, exploring the significance of lyrics in predicting song emotion has been receiving more attention in recent years. One major impediment to MME research is the lack of clearly-labeled and publicly-available datasets of separately annotated lyrics and audio. In the first section of this paper, we describe the creation of the LAMP dataset, containing 492 mandarin pop songs with separate mood annotations for lyrics text and audio music. Our second contribution is to demonstrate with statistical analysis on the LAMP dataset how lyrics and audio contribute individually to a song's overall mood. Our analysis suggests that lyrics can serve as a valid measure for music mood estimation, especially in song valence, and provide supplementary mood information to audio. Thirdly, we propose the Sentiment Score Approach for extracting affective words from lyrics text and show that it is the most effective individual method for improving MME accuracy while reducing the number of features. Lastly, we combine our best lyrical feature configuration with audio features in an MME system for estimating song valence. This configuration outperforms audio-features-only by 16.517% and lyrical-features-only by 1.5%, suggesting strongly that lyrical features can be an important source of supplementary information for audio-music features when predicting song valence.","2376-6816;23766816","Electronic:978-0-7695-4253-9; POD:978-1-4244-8668-7","10.1109/TAAI.2010.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5695432","Mandarin pop song;lyrics;music information retrieval;music mood estimation;valence","","information retrieval;music;statistical analysis","LAMP dataset;Mandarin pop songs;lyrics-and-audio mandopop dataset;music information retrieval;music mood estimation;sentiment score approach;song emotion prediction;song valence;statistical analysis","","1","","25","","","18-20 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different quality measures have been successfully applied for several specified user tasks and established visualization techniques, like Scatterplots, Scatterplot Matrices or Parallel Coordinates. Many other popular visualization techniques exist, but due to the structural differences, the measures are not directly applicable to them and new approaches are needed.

Thus visual analytics tools to support these activities must incorporate context. But, context is a difficult concept to define, model, and represent. Creating and representing context in support of visually-enabled reasoning about complex problems with complex information is a complementary but different challenge than that addressed in context-aware computing. In the latter, the goal is automated adaptation of the system to meet user needs for applications such as mobile location-based services where information about the location, the user, and the user goals filters what gets presented on a small mobile device. In contrast, for visual analytics-enabled information foraging and sensemaking, the user is likely to take an active role in foraging for the contextual information needed to support sensemaking in relation to some multifaceted problem. In this paper, we address the challenges of constructing and representing context within visual interfaces that support analytical reasoning in crisis management and humanitarian relief. The challenges stem from the diverse forms of information that can provide context and difficulty in defining and operationalizing context itself. Here, we pay particular attention to document foraging to support construction of the geographic and historical context within which monitoring and sensemaking can be carried out. Specifically, we present the concept of geo-historical context (GHC) and outline an empirical assessment of both the concept and its implementation in the Context Discovery Application, a web-based tool that supports document foraging and sensemaking.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9487-3; POD:978-1-4244-9488-0","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652895","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5652895","context;foraging;geographic information retrieval;mapping;sensemaking;text analysis","Cognition;Computational modeling;Context;Context modeling;Data models;Ontologies;Semantics","cognition;geographic information systems;inference mechanisms;mobile computing;user interfaces","context discovery application;context-aware computing;context-dependent activities;crisis management;document foraging;geo-historical context support;humanitarian relief;information foraging;sensemaking;visual analytics tools;visual interfaces;visually-enabled reasoning;web-based tool","","3","","32","","","25-26 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To enhance the accuracy of search results, we designed a Cloud ontology. A Cloud ontology contains a set of Cloud concepts, individuals of those concepts, and the relationship among those individuals. It is used for determining the similarity among Cloud service using three kinds of devised reasoning methods which are (1) concept similarity reasoning, (2) object property similarity reasoning, and (3) data type property similarity reasoning. Finally, the empirical results show that the result using Cloudle with the Cloud ontology has significantly better performance in finding the appropriate Cloud service than the result using Cloudle without the Cloud ontology and the result without Cloudle.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4305-5; POD:978-1-4244-9396-8","10.1109/APSCC.2010.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708589","Cloud Computing;Cloud Ontology;Information retrieval;Search Engines","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Cognition;Computer architecture;Ontologies;Search engines;Semantics","cloud computing;inference mechanisms;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);search engines","Cloudle;academic community;cloud computing;cloud concepts;cloud ontology;concept similarity reasoning;cost requirement;data type property similarity reasoning;devised reasoning methods;functional requirement;industrial community;matching algorithm;multicriteria cloud service search engine;object property similarity reasoning;technical requirement","","23","","8","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pitch estimation is carried out by means of a front-end that jointly uses a constant-Q and a bispectral analysis of the input audio signal; subsequently, the processed signal is correlated with a fixed 2-D harmonic pattern. Onsets and durations detection procedures are based on the combination of the constant-Q bispectral analysis with information from the signal spectrogram.

The proposed framework, called Music Information Geometry, allows online segmentation of audio streams to metric balls where each ball represents a quasi-stationary continuous chunk of audio, and discusses methods to qualify and quantify information between entities for similarity computing.

In recent years, language models have been proposed on Information Retrieval and increased in popularity, due to their simplicity, clear probabilistic meaning. In addition these models offer possibility of integrating a priori document information. Several features have been used to estimate the prior probability of a document such as: document length.

On enterprises' side goals are make more profits by reducing costs or increasing incomes. In the case of content-based web sites their goals is to spread its contents among web users. An automatic ontology learning method is developed for the search engine result analysis, which trains ontology with world knowledge of hundreds of different subjects in a multilevel taxonomy. This ontology is then mined to find important classification rules, and these rules are used to perform an extensive analysis of the content of the largest general-purpose Internet search engines in use today. Instead of representing collections as a set of terms, which commonly occurs in collection selection, they are represented as a set of subjects, leading to a more robust representation of information and a decrease of synonymy. Parallelizing the web search results incorporated with Bookshelf Data Structure owe to the simplistic applicability of the aforementioned strategy, and the use of simple data structure. The method was also used to analyze the content of the most popular search engines in use today, including Google and Yahoo. In conclusion, this research paper focus on the ontology based semantic web search results visualization using BSDSC(Book Shelf Data Structure Code) based on BookShelf Data Structure.

The information users evaluate the linkages proposed by the information publishers. The network evolutionarily reconstructs the topological structures of the P2P network based on the fitness obtained from the users.

The graphical interface provides an effective means for interactive exploration of search results using filter techniques, query expansion and navigation. Our observations indicate that, of three investigated retrieval tasks, the textual interface is sufficient for the phrase verification task, wherein both views support context-sensitive word choice, and the WORDGRAPH best supports the exploration of a phrase's context or the underlying corpus.

The prediction of query difficulty level is an interesting and important issue in Information Retrieval (IR) and is still an open research. In order to appreciate importance of query difficulty prediction we present an example., Information Retrieval (IR) is the Science of searching the relevant documents based on user's need and a way towards discovering knowledge from text data. User's needs are often expressed in terms of query. It has been observed that there is a word mismatch problem while matching user's query to the documents. This is because users and authors of documents do not use same vocabulary. Query expansion/reformulation is a method to overcome such mismatch in terminology. Query expansion (QE) has become a well known technique that has been shown to improve average retrieval performance. However despite extensive research QE does not provide consistent gains over different query sets and collections. Therefore this technique has not been used in many operational systems as it may degrade performance of individual queries. A thorough investigation into robustness of query expansion is required in order to ensure reliability of query expansion for individual queries. It is well-known in the Information Retrieval community that methods such as query expansion can help ”easy” queries but are detrimental to ”hard” queries If the performance of queries can be predicted before retrieval then specific measures can be taken to improve the overall performance of the system. In this paper we do thorough investigations of various query difficulty predictors l and suggest two new query predictorsl based on co-occurrence of query terms. To evaluate the predictors, we have experimented on standard TREC collections. Our work is significant as it is a step towards judging re- - liability and robustness of query processing operations such as query expansion.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-0-7695-4257-7; POD:978-1-4244-9244-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2010.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5693387","Pre-retrieval query predictors;information retrieval;query difficulty","","data mining;information retrieval systems;query formulation;query processing;relevance feedback;reliability;text analysis;word processing","co-occurrence based predictor;information retrieval system reliability;knowledge discovery;query difficulty estimation;query expansion;query reformulation;relevant document searching;standard TREC collection;text data;user query matching;word mismatch problem","","5","","24","","","13-13 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most topic models rely on the bag-of-words assumption that results in learned latent topics composed of lists of individual words. Unfortunately, these words may convey topical information but lack accurate semantic knowledge of the text. In this paper, we present the semantic associative topic model, where the concept of the semantic association terms is extended to topic modeling, which provides guidance on modeling the semantic associations that occur among single words by expressing a document as an association of multiple words. Further, the pointwise KL-divergence metric is used to measure the significance of the association. We also integrate original PLSA and SATM models, which have mixed feature representations.

Secondly, some comparisons are made to verify if there is really a correlation between the sampling ratio (SR) and the SAS in a monolingual language field. Thirdly, the correlation between the SR and SAS is analyzed in multilingual domains.

In this model encryption method maintains data confidentiality and a utility that help to create PIR reply which maintains data privacy. In PIR Scheme data privacy is achieved by adding noise data into the result of a typical query which is called as PIR reply. Single-database PIR schemes are generally not practical because of its expensiveness from computational point of view. Here we propose a model that suggests the use of General-Purpose computation using Graphic Processing Units (GPGPU) commodity to process such type of computationally intensive operations. This model will help to achieve practical implementation of single-database PIR scheme which uses encryption algorithm to maintain data confidentiality as secondary goal and it serves to create database reply to maintain data privacy as primary goal.

Accordingly, interactive graphical and visualization techniques are suggested to increase the ability of the display to handle large numbers of results while simultaneously presenting several attributes for each Web page. In addition, query reformulation and reconstruction is usually controlled by the search engine. Consequently, the results suffer from redundancy and/or irrelevancy. Integrating the user in the process of query reformulation - by visualizing the process itself - may benefit the overall search relevance.

Now a days, the user rely on web for the information need but the currently available search engines though using sophisticated document indexing algorithms, quite often gives a long list of results, much of which are not always relevant to the user's requirement. Since a user has a specific goal when searching for information, personalized search may provide the results that accurately satisfy user's specific goal and intent for the search. Personalization of web search is to retrieve information according to user's interests which may be inferred from user's actions, browsed documents or past query history etc. This paper conducts a survey of how personalization (if applied) can give useful knowledge to the user. Several user personalization approaches and techniques developed for the information retrieval domain are illustrated in this paper.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8679-3; POD:978-1-4244-8678-6","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5941815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941815","Information retrieval;Personalization;Web search","Computer science;Context;History;Privacy;Search engines;Web search","Web services;document handling;information retrieval;search engines","Web search;Web service;document indexing algorithm;information retrieval;information searching;information solution;query history;search engine;user personalization;user requirement","","0","","42","","","8-10 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is evaluated to identify features from execution traces of two open source systems from different domains, JHotDraw and ArgoUML.

It is based on language modeling in conjunction with a uniform character model that uses edit distance only. The technique compares well to state-of-the-art correction techniques that are based on language modeling and source-specific character error models. Although the proposed technique yielded lower correction effectiveness, its impact on retrieval effectiveness is statistically significant and at par with state-of-the-art correction techniques. The main requirement of the proposed technique is the training of a “good” language model matching genre, style, and temporal coverage.

Whereas the standard non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) assumes fixed spectral atoms, an extension is proposed where the temporal activations (coefficients of the decomposition on the spectral atom basis) become frequency dependent and follow a time-varying autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling. This extension can thus be interpreted with the help of a source/filter paradigm and is referred to as source/filter factorization. This factorization leads to an efficient single-atom decomposition for a single audio event with strong spectral variation (but with constant pitch).

However, very few studies consider narrowing down the search space in the query formulation step. That is, query specifications can be used during the query process. This paper takes Google as an example and presents several mobile interfaces for web search by asking users to specify what kind or content of web documents are to be retrieved. These query specification interfaces are able to retrieve less but more relevant documents to users' queries.

For onset detection, late fusion is employed by combining a novel spectral flux-based feature which incorporates pitch tuning information and a novel salience function-based descriptor. For each segment defined by two onsets, an overlapping partial treatment procedure is used and a pitch set score function is proposed.

It is not uncommon to see users browsing digital collections without having a clear idea of the keyword search that they should perform. However, we believe that such initial query search is not totally independent from the target search. Therefore, we use these initial document selections to further explore these documents. In the following demonstration, we exploit On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) for knowledge discovery in digital collections to achieve query refinement. Such refinement is the result of applying a traditional ranking technique, based on the vector space model, selecting the top keywords in the resulting subset of documents, and then displaying certain cuboids of the keywords.

In this paper, the index takes the form of a phonetic posterior-feature matrix. Accuracy is improved by formulating STD as a discriminative training problem and directly optimizing the FOM, through its use as an objective function to train a transformation of the index. The outcome of indexing is then a matrix of enhanced posterior-features that are directly tailored for the STD task. The technique is shown to improve the FOM by up to 13% on held-out data. Additional analysis explores the effect of the technique on phone recognition accuracy, examines the actual values of the learned transform, and demonstrates that using an extended training data set results in further improvement in the FOM.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2010.2096215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654582","Information retrieval;speech processing;speech recognition;spoken term detection","Accuracy;Hidden Markov models;Indexing;Measurement;Speech;Training","optimisation;speech processing","discriminative optimization;discriminative training problem;figure of merit;objective function;phone recognition accuracy;phonetic posterior-feature matrix;phonetic spoken term detection","","4","","31","","20101203","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Motivated by our prior work on the investigation of user reviews that broadly appear in such sites, we hence propose a new recommender algorithm by fusing a self-supervised emoticon-integrated sentiment classification approach, by which the missing User-Item Rating Matrix can be substituted by the virtual ratings which are predicted by decomposing user reviews as given to the items. To test the algorithm's practical value, we have first identified the self-supervised sentiment classification's higher performance by comparing it with a supervised approach. Moreover, we conducted a statistic evaluation method to show the effectiveness of our recommender system on improving Chinese online video recommendations' accuracy.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-0-7695-4257-7; POD:978-1-4244-9244-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2010.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5693423","Information retrieval;online video recommendation;opinion mining;sentiment analysis","","Internet;Web sites;augmented reality;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;video retrieval","Chinese online video recommendation;Chinese video-sharing Web site;review sentiment classification;self-supervised emoticon-integrated sentiment classification;statistic evaluation method;user-item rating matrix;virtual rating","","0","","29","","","13-13 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Learning, skill, knowledge, and memory all come in two forms: explicit, in which we are aware of-and can hence describe in words-how we are able to do something, and implicit, in which we are unaware of how we are doing something. Most cognitive science is devoted to discovering the implicit mechanisms underlying our cognitive competence and making them explicit. Conscious introspection does not reveal what they are. The explanatory goal of cognitive science is to reverse-engineer what it takes to pass the Turing Test. That is, once we can successfully design a system that is capable of doing whatever any normal person can do, indistinguishably from any person, to any person, then we have a candidate explanation of how the human brain does it. In modeling human cognitive capacity, we must consider what to build into our candidate mechanism and what to offload onto external cognitive technology, such as Google Web searches. Word meanings can be internally represented in two ways: sensorimotor and verbal. In this work we tested conjunctive and disjunctive Google searches for target terms that have their own Wikipedia entries, using either the target terms themselves or the three words that had the highest co occurrence frequency with the target words in WordNet. We found that the highly co-occurring words were surprisingly ineffective in retrieving the target word and there was no significant correlation with age of acquisition or concreteness. This raises some questions about the similarity between human associative memory and Google-based associative search.","1541-1672;15411672","","10.1109/MIS.2011.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714201","Google;Intelligent systems;Internet search;cognitive simulation;information retrieval","Cognition;Electronic publishing;Google;Internet;Search methods;Semantics","Web sites;cognition;query formulation","Google Web searches;cognitive science;human associative memory;neuroimaging studies;neuropsychology","","2","","20","","","Jan.-Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
