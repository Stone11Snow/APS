The resultant index allows both keyword querying against the full text of the document and the literal values occurring in the RDF annotations, along with the ability to browse and query the ontology. We motivate our approach as a key enabler for fully exploiting the semantic Web in the area of knowledge management and argue that the ability to combine searching and browsing behaviours more fully supports a typical information-seeking task.

We present a novel content-based music retrieval method that is robust against pitch errors and tempo variations in the queries, which is especially advantageous for query-by-humming. The melody of a music item and that of a hummed query are represented by point sequences, and the skeletons of the melody are used to do melody searching and alignment. A novel point skipping dynamic programming algorithm is proposed for robust and efficient melody skeleton matching. The melody similarity measure is then computed based on the alignment of the point sequences.

First, candidate regions are extracted by using the characteristics of a parabola that is downward convex, then the candidate region will be verified based on a dissolve modeling error. If a dissolve modeling error on a candidate region is less than a threshold adaptively determined based on the variances between the candidate regions and the target correlation, the candidate region should be a dissolve region with a correlation less than the target correlation. By considering the correlation between neighbor scenes, the proposed method is able to be a semantic scene-change detector. The proposed algorithm was tested on various types of data and its performance proved to be more accurate and reliable when compared with other commonly used method dissolve modeling error. The proposed algorithm consists of two steps. First, the candidate dissolve regions are extracted using the characteristics of the first and second derivate of a variance curve. In the second step, the candidate regions are verified based on a dissolve modeling error. If the dissolve modeling error for a candidate region is less than a threshold defined by a dissolve modeling error with a target correlation, the candidate region is determined as a dissolve region with a lower correlation than the target correlation, which can be given application-dependently by user or can be used as a control factor of video parsing.

In this paper we present the concepts of asymmetric similarity model and heavy frequency vector (HFV). The former can detect subset copies well; the latter can save a great resources and CPU time. We develop two new asymmetric measures: HFM and HIPM. The HFM and HIPM are derived from cosine function and proportion function by combining asymmetric similarity concept with HFV. The HFV is to truncate the original full frequency vector to a short vector. We can adjust the parameter of HFV to balance the model's performance.

However, variable data sizes, data updates, limited client resources, and frequent client disconnections make cache management a challenge. We propose a gain-based cache replacement policy, Min-SAUD, for wireless data dissemination when cache consistency must be enforced before a cached item is used. Min-SAUD considers several factors that affect cache performance, namely, access probability, update frequency, data size, retrieval delay, and cache validation cost. The paper employs stretch as the major performance metric since it accounts for the data service time and, thus, is fair when items have different sizes. We prove that Min-SAUD achieves optimal stretch under some standard assumptions. Moreover, a series of simulation experiments have been conducted to thoroughly evaluate the performance of Min-SAUD under various system configurations. The simulation results show that, in most cases, the Min-SAUD replacement policy substantially outperforms two existing policies, namely, LRU and SAIU.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.1264827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264827","","Application software;Broadcasting;Computational modeling;Computer science;Costs;Delay;Frequency;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Resource management","cache storage;client-server systems;information dissemination;mobile computing;mobile radio","Min-SAUD;access probability;cache consistency;cache management;cache performance;cache validation cost;client disconnections;data caching;data service time;data size;data updates;gain-based cache replacement policy;limited client resources;mobile clients;mobile computing;optimal cache replacement policy;performance evaluation;performance metric;retrieval delay;update frequency;variable data sizes;wireless data dissemination;wireless data dissemination systems","","43","","36","","","Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Land cover information corresponding to spectral characteristics is identified by supervised classification based on support vector machines with automatic model selection, while textural features characterizing spatial information are extracted using Gabor wavelet coefficients. Within identified land cover categories, textural features are clustered to acquire search-efficient space in an object-oriented database with associated images in an image database. Interesting patterns are then retrieved using a query-by-example approach.

Mathematical model is widely used as a representation of time series, but few papers discuss it in similarity measure of time series. In this paper, we propose a Markov model based technique for similarity/distance measures of variable-length time sequences. State space of Markov model is partitioned by hierarchical clustering method, and the information of state-transition is used to represent a time series. The similarity/distance measures of time sequences can be defined as various functions of the difference between their state-transition information, and some widely used distance measures can be considered as our specific cases. In addition, in modeling procedure, the vector sequence in reconstructed phase space is used instead of the original time sequence, which more effectively reflects the dynamical property of time series. Experimental results show that it works well under the strong noise environment, and it is versatile for various applications by its flexible definition.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264486","","Computer science;Data mining;Databases;Educational institutions;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;State-space methods;Time measurement;Time series analysis","Markov processes;data mining;time series","Markov model;data mining;hierarchical clustering method;similarity measure;state-transition information;time series database;variable-length time sequences","","2","","12","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of the project is to automatically retrieve from a database some information regarding a song without any previous knowledge and without the insertion of additional information. The goal is obtained by analyzing the signal and extracting a robust feature. That feature can be used to make a distinction between different songs but also to identify as similar two versions of the same songs. Moreover we analyze also the error probability and we define a confidence for the obtained match.

The content-based video retrieval system uses a visual-sketch approach for the design of the graphical query interface. The system uses a two-stage indexing and retrieval approach - first to classify video shots into separate databases using their motion characteristics, and second to search each database for colour features. The two-stage approach reduces the search time to almost half at a slight reduction in retrieval rate.

Similarity is evaluated based on four image feature types: color histogram, image texture, Fourier coefficients, and wavelet coefficients, using the vector dot product as a distance metric. Current retrieval accuracy varies across pathological categories depending on the number of available training samples and the effectiveness of the feature set. The distance measure of the search algorithm was validated by agglomerative cluster analysis in light of the medical domain knowledge. Results show a correlation between pathological significance and the image document distance value generated by the computer algorithm. This correlation agrees with observed visual similarity. This validation method has an advantage over traditional statistical evaluation methods when sample size is small and where domain knowledge is important.

Proceedings of the","20040226","2004","","","10 pp.","","The increase in persistent conversations in the form of chat and instant messaging (IM) has presented new opportunities for researchers. This paper describes a method for evaluating and visualizing persistent conversations by creating a speech act profile for conversation participants using speech act theory and concepts from fuzzy logic. This method can be used either to score a participant based on possible intentions or to create a visual map of those intentions. Transcripts from the Switchboard corpus, which have been marked up with speech act labels according to a SWBD-DAMSL tag set of 42 tags, are used to train language models and a modified hidden Markov model (HMM) to obtain probabilities for each speech act type for a given sentence. Rather than choosing the speech act with the maximum probability and assigning it to the sentence, the probabilities are aggregated for each conversation participant creating a set of speech act profiles, which can be visualized as a radar graphs. Several example profiles are shown along with possible interpretations. The profiles can be used as an overall picture of a conversation, and may be useful in various analyses of persistent conversations including information retrieval, deception detection, and online technical support monitoring.","","POD:0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265283","","Fuzzy logic;Hidden Markov models;Image retrieval;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Natural languages;Radar detection;Speech analysis;Visualization","electronic messaging;fuzzy logic;hidden Markov models;probability;speech processing","Markov model;Switchboard corpus;conversation analysis;deception detection;fuzzy logic;information retrieval;instant messaging;online technical support monitoring;probabilistic method;speech act profiling","","5","1","24","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The degree of similarity is often quantified by a distance measure defined over the space of extracted feature vectors. In typical applications, since the volume of data is huge, and the feature vectors are of high dimensionality, it becomes necessary to access the feature vectors from a hard storage medium during the search. Since I/O operations on hard storage devices are slow, the time complexity of the search is dominated by the I/O time. One of the most effective approaches to reduce the time complexity is compromising the search accuracy by accessing compressed feature vectors. The processing time is then approximately proportional to the rate R at which the sequence of feature vectors is compressed. In this paper we characterize the set of all achievable time-accuracy pairs.","","POD:0-7803-7501-7","10.1109/ISIT.2002.1023620","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1023620","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Distortion measurement;Electronic mail;Encoding;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Rate-distortion;Spatial databases","computational complexity;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;multimedia databases;rate distortion theory","I/O operations;compressed feature vectors;content-based retrieval;distance measure;feature vectors;hard storage medium;multimedia databases;rate-distortion approach;similarity search;time complexity;time-accuracy pairs","","1","","3","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose simultaneous relevant feature selection and classification using the samples provided by the user to improve retrieval accuracy. The classifier is defined by a separating hyperplane, while the sparse weight vector characterizing the hyperplane defines a small set of relevant features. This set of relevant features is used for classification and can be used for analysis at a later stage. Mutually exclusive sets of images are shown to the user at each iteration to obtain maximum information from the user. Experimental results show that our algorithm performs better than the feature relevance weighting and feature selection schemes and comparably with the classification scheme using SVMs, in terms of retrieval accuracy, and it has the advantage of being faster than the classification scheme using SVMs.","","POD:0-7803-8162-9","10.1109/TENCON.2003.1273230","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273230","","Automation;Compression algorithms;Computer science;Feedback;High-speed networks;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Internet;Real time systems","feature extraction;image classification;image retrieval;iterative methods;optimisation;relevance feedback","SVM;feature classification;feature relevance weighting;feature selection;image retrieval;optimization;query image;relevance feedback;relevant features;separating hyperplane;sparse weight vector;user perception","","0","","6","","","15-17 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in retrieval of shapes on two data sets of two-dimensional open and closed shapes of marine life species.

The adequate representation is a key element for the efficient retrieval. For this reason, MPEG-7 standard was established for description of multimedia data. However, the content of the standard is massive, and the approach method is not clear for real application system yet. We suggest implementation scheme of retrieval system with using visual descriptors only, and present the performance results of developed system.

"An intelligent image retrieval system using XML","Sungyong Hong; Yunmook Nah","Dept. of Comput. Eng., Dankook Univ., South Korea","10th International Multimedia Modelling Conference, 2004. Proceedings.","20040219","2004","","","363","","With the rapid development of Internet technology, the number of Internet users and the amount of multimedia information on the Internet is ever increasing. Recently, the Web sites, such as e-business sites and shopping mall sites, deal with lots of image information. As a result, it is required to support content-based image retrieval efficiently on such image data. This paper proposes an intelligent image retrieval system, which adopts XML technology. To support object-based content retrieval on product catalog images containing multiple objects, we describe a multilevel metadata structure representing the local features, global features, and semantics of image data. To enable semantic-based and content-based retrieval on such image data, we design an XML-schema for the proposed metadata. We also describe how to automatically transform the retrieval results into the forms suitable for the various user environments, such as Web browser or mobile browser, using XSLT. The proposed scheme can be utilized to enable efficient image metadata sharing between systems, and it will contribute in improving the retrieval correctness and the user's satisfaction on content-based e-catalog image retrieval.","","POD:0-7695-2084-7","10.1109/MULMM.2004.1265010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265010","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feature extraction;Image analysis;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Internet;Tellurium;XML","Internet;Web sites;XML;content-based retrieval;electronic commerce;image retrieval;knowledge based systems;meta data;object-oriented methods","Internet;XML;XSLT;content-based image retrieval;e-business sites;image retrieval system;intelligent retrieval;metadata structure;multimedia;object-based content retrieval;product catalog images;semantic-based retrieval;shopping mall sites","","2","","1","","","5-7 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the existing content-based video retrieval systems still suffer from the following problems. 1) Semantics-sensitive video classification problem because of the semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic visual concepts; 2) Integrated video access problem because of the lack of efficient video database indexing, automatic video annotation, and concept-oriented summary organization techniques. In this paper, we have proposed a novel framework, called ClassView, to make some advances toward more efficient video database indexing and access. 1) A hierarchical semantics-sensitive video classifier is proposed to shorten the semantic gap. The hierarchical tree structure of the semantics-sensitive video classifier is derived from the domain-dependent concept hierarchy of video contents in a database. Relevance analysis is used for selecting the discriminating visual features with suitable importances. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is also used to determine the classification rule for each visual concept node in the classifier. 2) A hierarchical video database indexing and summary presentation technique is proposed to support more effective video access over a large-scale database. The hierarchical tree structure of our video database indexing scheme is determined by the domain-dependent concept hierarchy which is also used for video classification. The presentation of visual summary is also integrated with the inherent hierarchical video database indexing tree structure. Integrating video access with efficient database indexing tree structure has provided great opportunity for supporting more powerful video search engines.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2003.819583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261888","","Classification tree analysis;Content based retrieval;Data analysis;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Spatial databases;Tree data structures;Video compression;Visual databases","data compression;database indexing;image classification;image retrieval;video coding;video databases","ClassView;digital video compression;domain-dependent concept hierarchy;expectation-maximization algorithm;hierarchical semantics-sensitive video classifier;hierarchical tree structure;hierarchical video shot classification;large-scale database;summary presentation technique;video database indexing;video retrieval;visual summarization","","64","4","54","","","Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose an XQuery engine that can be used as an XQuery processing module in digital library systems that support XML documents. Our system has the following useful aspects. First, any user interface that generates XQuery is able to access any digital library systems embedding our XQuery engine.

The virtual microscope client software runs on the end user's PC or workstation, while database software for storing, retrieving and processing the microscope image data runs on a parallel computer or on a set of workstations at one or more potentially remote sites. We have designed and implemented two versions of the data server software. One implementation is a customization of a database system framework that is optimized for a tightly coupled parallel machine with attached local disks. The second implementation is component-based, and has been designed to accommodate access to and processing of data in a distributed, heterogeneous environment. We also have developed caching client software, implemented in Java, to achieve good response time and portability across different computer platforms. The performance results presented show that the Virtual Microscope systems scales well, so that many clients can be adequately serviced by an appropriately configured data server.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/TITB.2004.823952","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263896","","Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Database systems;Emulation;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Microscopy;Software systems;Workstations","PACS;biomedical optical imaging;diseases;optical microscopy;virtual reality","Java;client software;client/server architecture;computer platforms;configured data server;data server software;database software;digital slide images;digital telepathology;high power light microscope;local disks;microscope image data;multiple clients;software system;virtual microscope design","Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Database Management Systems;Environment;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Microscopy;Software;Software Design;Systems Integration;Telepathology;User-Computer Interface","34","10","40","","","Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We first describe the way the Faraday rotation angle due to electron content along the observing path varies across the two-dimensional field of view. Over open ocean surfaces, we show that it is possible to retrieve the total electron content (TEC) at nadir from radiometric data considered over the bulk of the field of view, with an accuracy better than 0.5 TEC units, compatible with requirements for surface salinity observations. Using a full-polarimetric design improves the accuracy on the estimated TEC value. The random uncertainty on retrieved salinity is decreased by about 15% with respect to results obtained when using only data for the first Stokes parameter, which is immune to Faraday rotation. Similarly, TEC values over land surfaces may be retrieved with the accuracy required in the context of soil moisture measurements. Finally, direct TEC estimation provides information which should allow to correct for ionospheric attenuation as well.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.817685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262589","","Content based retrieval;Electrons;Information retrieval;L-band;Land surface;Oceans;Radiometry;Sea surface;Sea surface salinity;Space missions","ionospheric electromagnetic wave propagation;radiometry;radiowave interferometry","0.5 TEC units;2D field of view;2D interferometric radiometry;Faraday rotation angle;L-band radiometry;SMOS future space mission;Stokes parameter;TEC estimation;electromagnetic propagation;interferometric radiometer;ionospheric attenuation;ionospheric effects;land surfaces;nadir;observing path;open ocean surfaces;radiometric data;random uncertainty;remote sensing;sea surface salinity;soil moisture measurements;surface quantity estimation;total electron content","","13","","25","","","Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This kind of presentation does not only contain the content based on the structured features (e.g. spatial relations) but also on the semantic features (e.g. the information ""shake hands""). But most of current data models of multimedia document database have some shortage in providing the description of this information in different layers and different granularities. In this paper, we locate the content information of the multimedia documents into several proper layers and define MDU (multimedia document basic unit) to collect this information in different granularities. And then, we discuss the relations among MDUs. Combining the definitions above, we can formalize the presentation of the multimedia documents and multimedia document database.

The tonal track plays the masking role of specific segments where the representative frames are fetched along the tonal tracks based on their significance. The unmasked tonal energies for different subbands resulting from the audio psychoacoustic module are aggregated and arranged into the observation data matrix. Finally, the signature projection matrix can be learned through performing the independent component analysis (ICA) process on the observation matrices that the components of matrix are quantized as the index of an audio sequence.

Automatic segmentation is highly desired because of the high cost of manual segmentation. While a lot of research has been conducted on topic segmentation of transcribed spoken text, most attempts rely on domain-specific cues and formal presentation format, and require extensive training; none of these features exist in lecture videos with unscripted and spontaneous speech. In addition, lecture videos usually have few scene changes, which imply that the visual information that most video segmentation methods rely on is not available. Furthermore, even when there are scene changes, they do not match with the topic transitions. In this paper, we make use of the transcribed speech text extracted from the audio track of video to segment lecture videos into topics. We review related research and propose a segmentation approach. Our approach utilizes features such as noun phrases and combines multiple content-based and discourse-based features. Our preliminary results show that the noun phrases are salient features and the combination of multiple features is promising to improve segmentation accuracy.","","POD:0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265045","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Electronic learning;Image segmentation;Information management;Information retrieval;Layout;Speech;Streaming media;Videos","computer aided instruction;content-based retrieval;image segmentation;multimedia systems;speech synthesis;text analysis","automatic segmentation;lecture videos;multimedia-based e-learning;multiple linguistic features;search capability;transcribed speech text;video segmentation","","3","","33","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the majority of extant KM research treats knowledge as a static object that can be acquired, stored and retrieved through information technology. Two fundamental problems emerge from this current majority view: (1) many scholars view knowledge as distinct from information, and (2) very little attention is paid to the dynamics of knowledge - a phenomenon which many scholars term ""knowledge flows."" In this article we build upon a steady stream of research in computational organization theory to develop agent based models of knowledge flows. Such models draw from emerging theory for multidimensional representation of the knowledge flow phenomenon, and they enable the dynamics of enterprise knowledge flows to be formalized and simulated through computational models.

After discussing the training and pruning procedures, we examine the performances of neural algorithms in inverting combinations of radar backscattering coefficients at different frequencies and polarization states. The analysis includes an evaluation of the expected sensitivity of the algorithm to measurement noise stemming both from speckle and from fluctuations of vegetation and soil parameters. The NNA accomplishments are compared with those of linear regressions for the same channel combinations.

Assuming best-effort networks as the infrastructure, we are developing a multimedia data retrieval system based on QoS (quality of service) concept that searches and retrieves various types of multimedia data from plural multimedia data archives. As one of QoS parameters, we select the user's response time. Since the response time is related with network throughputs, throughput measurement becomes an important technology in the system. So far, we have developed a mechanism to decide a retrieval order of multimedia data that match with the user's searching request. The mechanism is called QoS scenario and it balances the user's searching request (keyword matching) and the QoS factor related with the user's response time that can be determined by the throughput measurement. The QoS scenario was used in the first version of our multimedia data retrieval system. In this paper, we study the active and passive throughput measurement technologies. Also, a multimedia data structure is introduced on the basis of the Dublin Core that has been standardized. Owing to the multimedia data structure, the system is able to hold interoperability and wide-area-network search and retrieval can be realized.","","POD:0-7803-7912-8","10.1109/ISIE.2003.1267298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1267298","","Data structures;Delay;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Quality of service;Software libraries;Throughput;Time measurement;Videos","Internet;information retrieval systems;multimedia communication;quality of service","Dublin Core;Internet;QoS scenario;active throughput measurement technologies;keyword matching;multimedia applications;multimedia data archives;multimedia data retrieval system;passive throughput measurement technologies;quality of service;response time;users searching request;wide-area-network retrieval;wide-area-network search","","1","","13","","","9-11 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each logical cluster calculates the similarity using the MPI-based parallel program and returns the result to the agency host.

Similarity matching requires feature vector distance computation for each candidate image in an image database. Conventional algorithms based on exhaustive search are highly time consuming and inefficient. With the rapid increase in database size, there is a growing need for a fast and efficient retrieval system. A multiresolution data-structure based approach provides a good solution to the problem, but there is still scope for improvement. We propose a wavelet based multiresolution data-structure algorithm for faster image searching. The proposed approach reduces computation by around 50% over the multiresolution data-structure algorithm. In the proposed approach, we reuse the information obtained at lower resolution levels for similarity matching at higher resolution levels. This algorithm also saves disk storage space by about 50% over the multiresolution data-structure approach. The proposed approach can be easily combined with existing algorithms for further performance enhancement.

Proceedings of the","20040226","2004","","","9 pp.","","People recognize and use document genres as a way of identifying useful information and of participating in mutually understood communicative acts. Crowston and Kwasnik discuss the possibility of improving information access in large digital collections through the identification and use of document genre metadata. They draw on the definition of genre proposed by Orlikowski and Yates (1994), who describe genre as ""a distinctive type of communicative action, characterized by a socially recognized communicative purpose and common aspects of form"". Scholars infields such as rhetoric and library science have attempted to describe and systematize the notion of genre, and have offered many different definitions of genre. We like Orlikowski and Yates's definition because it takes into account all three aspects of genre that we recognize as fundamental: content, form, and purpose. A document's genre is a subtle and complex concept in which the content and form of a document are fused with its purpose or function. As such, a document's genre cannot be separated from the context in which it is used; the same document may be construed as being of a different genre depending on how it is invoked in a given situation. Starting from the document, a letter may be a personal communication, or a piece of evidence in a court of law, or an agreement, or even a work of art. Starting from the situation, we note that differences in an information situation are often reflected in the kind of document that is considered helpful (e.g., a problem set vs. a lesson plan vs. a tutorial about mathematics, for instance). Thus, we see genre as a multidimensional phenomenon, which takes into account not only the attributes of the document itself, but also of its role in human endeavor. In this paper, we discuss some considerations in developing a facetted classification for genres to address the problem of multi-dimensionality.","","POD:0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265268","","Art;Character recognition;Context;Humans;Information retrieval;Libraries;Mathematics;Multidimensional systems;Rhetoric","classification;document handling","digital collection;document genre metadata;facetted genre classification;information access;library science;multidimensionality issue;personal communication","","9","","22","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The process consists of two phases: problem discovery, in which the potential problems (ambiguities) of the initial query are discovered and estimated and query refinement, which analyses these ambiguities in order to provide suitable modification of that query that increases the precision and recall of the searching process. The agent performs comprehensive analyses of a query, based on the structure of the used vocabulary in an information portal and the content of its information repository. Moreover, the information about the previous users' behaviour and the activities of the current user are used for making the query refinement process more efficient (i.e. usage-driven and personalized). From the user's point of view, the main advantage of such an approach is that it enables a user to satisfy his information need in a more intuitive and efficient way.","","POD:0-7695-1999-7","10.1109/WISE.2003.1254467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254467","","Humans;Information analysis;Information filtering;Information resources;Information retrieval;Libraries;Performance analysis;Phase estimation;Portals;Vocabulary","information needs;library automation;portals;query formulation;query processing;software agents","human librarian;information need;information portal;information repository;information resources;information searching;librarian agent query refinement;library resources;problem discovery;searching process","","0","","25","","","10-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Finally, our algorithm holds exclusive latches not during whole split time but only during physical node split time that occupies the small part of a whole split process. For performance evaluation, we implement the proposed concurrency control algorithm and one of the existing link technique-based algorithms on MIDAS-III that is a storage system of a BADA-IV DBMS. We show through various experiments that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithm in terms of throughput and response time. Also, we propose a recovery protocol for our proposed concurrency control algorithm. The recovery protocol is designed to assure high concurrency and fast recovery.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.1264825","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264825","","Concurrency control;Concurrent computing;Content based retrieval;Database systems;Imaging phantoms;Indexes;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Protection;Protocols","concurrency control;data structures;database indexing;distributed databases","BADA-IV DBMS;MIDAS-III;concurrency control algorithm;enhanced concurrency control scheme;exclusive latches;link technique based algorithms;lock coupling;minimum bounding region updates;multidimensional index structures;node splits;partial lock coupling technique;performance evaluation;physical node split time;recovery protocol","","11","","20","","","Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Automated procedures are described to determine the position, size, shape and orientation of cells in each video frame. From the temporal changes in the values of these simple metadata parameters, high-level descriptors are derived that describe the semantic content of the video. This content information (specific intrinsic metadata) is of high information value, since it describes the behavior of cells and the timing of events within the video, including changes in environmental conditions experienced by the cells. When such metadata are properly organized in a searchable database, a content-based video query and retrieval system may be developed to locate particular objects, events or behaviors. Moreover, the availability of such semantic contents in the formal and generic format we propose will allow the application of data mining techniques and the amassing of more elaborate knowledge, e.g., species classification depending on behavior, patterns in response to environment changes, etc. The suitability and functionality of the proposed metadata model is demonstrated by the automated analysis of five different types of biological experiments, recording epithelial wound healing, bacterial multiplication, the rotations of tethered bacteria, and the swimming of motile bacteria and of human sperm.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2003.819581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261891","","Cells (biology);Content based retrieval;Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Microorganisms;Microscopy;Shape;Timing;Videos","content management;content-based retrieval;living systems;medical image processing;medical information systems;meta data;video databases","automated procedures;bacterial multiplication;biological microscopy;cell biological videos;content-based video query;database organization;epithelial wound healing;living cells;metadata descriptors;metadata model;metadata organizational system;metadata parameters;research videos;video content analysis;video retrieval system","","2","1","35","","","Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings of the","20040226","2004","","","10 pp.","","Genre characterizes text differently than the usual subject or prepositional content that has been the focus of most information retrieval and classification research. We developed a new method for automatic genre classification that is based on statistically selected features obtained from both subject-classified and genre-classified training data. The main idea of the genre classification method is to calculate the weight of a feature for a genre class by using its frequency statistics for subject classifications. Having observed that the deviation formula and discrimination formula using document frequency ratios work as expected, we went on to study the roles of various types of features such as content-bearing words, function words, morphemes, and punctuations marks. In the first part of this paper, we present some of our findings in the roles of the feature types for genre classification, with a brief discussion of the genre-based classification. The genre classes we used are those often found in Web documents: accident reportages, newspaper editorials, personal homepages, product reviews, product specifications, research articles, and Q&A's. The second part of the paper addresses the issue of how text genres help classifying documents based on the subject content of documents. This is a corollary to our original hypothesis that subject classification would help identifying the genre class of a document automatically. Our experimental work shows that while subject classes clearly help improving the genre-based classification, it is not clear whether using the genre class information for documents in the same way helps subject-based classification. However, we found that training a subject classifier with a set of documents belonging to a particular genre class improves subject-based classification.","","POD:0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265269","","Accidents;Computer science education;Content based retrieval;Frequency;Information retrieval;Internet;Search engines;Statistics;Training data","classification;information retrieval;text analysis","Web documents;automatic identification;genre class information;information retrieval;prepositional content;subject classification;subject-based categorization;text genres","","3","","12","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the methods to retrieve the bitstream are lost, it may be difficult, if not impossible to re-create them. The knowledge to interpret the bitstream is also at risk. The Digital Rosetta Stone (DRS) model was developed as a framework for capturing and maintaining the methods necessary to retrieve and display digital information stored on obsolete media or using obsolete software. However, this conceptual model had not yet been assessed by the community of professionals for its practical efficacy. This study used the Delphi method to explore the DRS with those responsible for maintaining access to digital data. Overall, the Delphi group expressed concerns about the practicality of developing the DRS, but agreed that it is an important concept that should be explored further. If found to be technologically feasible and economically desirable, the DRS could well lead to a long-term solution for recovering information that would otherwise be impossible to recover.","","POD:0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265277","","Accelerated aging;Displays;History;Humans;Information retrieval;Libraries;Printing;Production;Software maintenance;US Government","digital storage;information retrieval","Delphi assessment;digital information;digital rosetta stone model;information recovery;obsolete media;obsolete software","","0","","24","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a general probabilistic framework for Web page scoring systems (WPSS), which incorporates and extends many of the relevant models proposed in the literature. In particular, we introduce scoring systems for both generic (horizontal) and focused (vertical) search engines.

While collaborative filtering of information is a promising approach to retrieve useful information, unfortunately there is an obstacle in the current collaborative filtering. Since a single system that serves for every type of object with optimal performance is unlikely, or at least likely to be too complicated as to implementation, it is more practical to use multiple systems each of which is dealing with a specific target. In many collaborative filtering systems, a system for book only deals with books, and another system for movie only deals with movies. The data stored in the former system is not accessible from the latter, and vice versa. This situation brings about inflexibility of collaborative filtering. We claim that this issue can be addressed by realizing multiple collaborative filtering systems on top of a single platform. Since all the profiles are shared on a single platform, they are accessible from all the systems. The filtering accuracy of our approach is identical with a certain kind of collaborative filtering system under a certain condition. We describe a design of collaborative filtering service platform in this paper. Our design of platform is fairly generalized, and it can be realized both in a centralized and peer-to-peer fashion.","","POD:0-7695-2050-2","10.1109/SAINTW.2004.1268690","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268690","","Books;Collaboration;Feedback;Humans;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Internet;Motion pictures;Peer to peer computing","content-based retrieval;distributed databases;groupware;information filters;information retrieval;multimedia databases","Internet;Vineyard;collaborative filtering service platform;distributed environment;filtering accuracy;human feedbacks;information retrieval;multiple collaborative filtering;multiple systems","","1","","10","","","26-30 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though their framework supports content-based retrieval of images, the issues that arise when database grows dynamically and user queries are different from those in database, were not investigated. In the current work, we: (i) experimentally investigate issues relating to online addition of new images and image retrieval; and (ii) provide a theoretical analysis of the complexity and effectiveness of our retrieval system by comparing it with the conventional approach.

Automation of keyphrase generation is essential for the timely creation of keyphrases for large repositories in new domains where previous thesauri do not exist or for metacollections in which keyphrases that are meaningful across disparate collections are needed. In this paper we propose an automated keyphrase extraction algorithm using a non-dominated sorting multi-objective genetic algorithm. The ""clumping"" property of keyphrases is used to judge the appropriateness of a phrase and is quantified by a condensation clustering measure proposed by Bookstein. The objective is to find the smallest phrase set that has the best precision, as measured by average condensation clustering. Keyphrases were retrieved from a collection of design conference papers and the results were presented to domain experts for evaluation. Ninety percent of the generated phrases were deemed appropriate for use in a thesaurus for engineering design.","","POD:0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265278","","Automation;Data mining;Feedback;Genetic algorithms;Indexing;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Thesauri;Unified modeling language;Vocabulary","genetic algorithms;information retrieval systems","automated keyphrase extraction;information retrieval system;multiobjective genetic algorithm","","1","","15","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of GMBM-UBBM for language identification tasks and use of this model allows the proposed system to distinguish between the three languages with maximal 4.378% improvement accuracy superior to conventional GMM-UBM.","","POD:0-7803-7902-0","10.1109/NLPKE.2003.1276000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1276000","","Banking;Emergency services;Information retrieval;Internet;Natural languages;Probability density function;Speech;Statistics;Telephony;Training data","Gaussian processes;natural languages;speaker recognition","GMBM-UBBM;Gaussian mixture bigram model;OGI-TS multilanguage telephone speech corpus;bigram time correlation;language identification algorithm;speaker-independent language","","0","","10","","","26-29 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed memory system supports simultaneous access to pq data elements within a 4-directional block (p Ã— q), a row (1 Ã— pq), a column (pq Ã— 1), a forward-diagonal, and a backward-diagonal subarray with a constant interval in an arbitrary position in an M Ã— N array of data elements, where the number of memory modules, m, is a prime number greater than pq. For the simple and fast address calculation and routing circuit, the address differences between the pq addresses and the base address are arranged in ascending order according to the index numbers of m memory modules from the index number of memory module of the first element. The proposed multiaccess memory system provides more subarray types and more constant intervals than the previous memory systems.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2004.1268401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268401","","Circuits;Delay;Information retrieval;Interleaved codes;Registers;Routing","multi-access systems;network routing;parallel processing;storage allocation","SIMD computer;Single-Instruction Multiple-Data stream;conflict-free memory system;memory address calculation;multiaccess memory system;prime memory system;routing circuit","","12","2","32","","","April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose to extend the content-based approach towards the problem of multimedia collection profiling and comparison. Our method is to carry out visual feature clustering using self-organised maps, and then apply distance measures on the generated feature maps to evaluate their similarity. A modified Hausdorff distance is defined over the feature maps and further verified in an experiment using four image collections. Some preliminary results are presented with a comparison of different distance measures obtained from profiles generated by two feature schemes.","","POD:0-7695-2084-7","10.1109/MULMM.2004.1264991","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264991","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Employment;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information science;Mobile communication;Multimedia systems;Music information retrieval","content-based retrieval;distance measurement;feature extraction;image matching;image retrieval;multimedia databases;self-organising feature maps","Hausdorff distance;content-based comparison;distance measuring;feature extraction;feature maps;feature matching;image collections;image retrieval;images matching;multimedia collection comparison;multimedia collection profiling;self-organised maps;visual feature clustering","","2","1","24","","","5-7 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20040219","2004","","","285","290","Texture-segmentation is the crucial initial step for texture-based image retrieval. Texture is the main difficulty faced to a segmentation method. Many image segmentation algorithms either can't handle texture properly or cannot obtain texture features directly during segmentation which can be used for retrieval purpose. This paper describes an automatic texture segmentation algorithm based on a set of features derived from wavelet domain, which are effective in texture description for retrieval purpose. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently capture the textured regions in arbitrary images, with the features of each region extracted as well. The features of each textured region can be directly used to index image database with applications as texture-based image retrieval.","","POD:0-7695-2084-7","10.1109/MULMM.2004.1264998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264998","","Discrete wavelet transforms;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Indexes;Information retrieval;Layout;Multimedia databases;Spatial databases","discrete wavelet transforms;feature extraction;image retrieval;image segmentation;image texture;indexing;visual databases","arbitrary images;discrete wavelet transform;feature extraction;image segmentation;index image database;texture segmentation;texture-based image retrieval","","9","5","17","","","5-7 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An immediate consequence is that searching for images on the Web has become a current and important task. To search for images of interest, the most direct approach is keyword-based searching. However, since images on the Web are poorly labeled, direct application of standard keyword-based image searching techniques frequently yields poor results. We propose a comprehensive solution to this problem. In our approach, multiple sources of evidence related to the images are considered. To allow combining these distinct sources of evidence, we introduce an image retrieval model based on Bayesian belief networks. To evaluate our approach, we perform experiments on a reference collection composed of 54000 Web images. Our results indicate that retrieval using an image surrounding text passages is as effective as standard retrieval based on HTML tags. This is an interesting result because current image search engines in the Web usually do not take text passages into consideration. Most important, according to our results, the combination of information derived from text passages with information derived from HTML tags leads to improved retrieval, with relative gains in average precision figures of roughly 50 percent, when compared to the results obtained by the use of each source of evidence in isolation.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.1269666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269666","","Bayesian methods;Content based retrieval;Costs;HTML;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Performance evaluation;Web sites","Internet;belief networks;hypermedia markup languages;image retrieval;search engines","Bayesian belief networks;HTML tags;World Wide Web;evidence combination;image retrieval;image search engines;keyword-based image searching techniques;multiple evidence ranking;text passages","","29","4","34","","","April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
