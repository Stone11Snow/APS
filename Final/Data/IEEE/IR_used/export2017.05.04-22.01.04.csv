As a result, the integration of similarity based retrieval techniques of multimedia data into DBMSs is currently an active research issue. We first illustrate the importance of similarity based operations. Then, we present our image data repository model that supports similarity based operations conveniently under an object-relational database paradigm. Furthermore, we present novel similarity based operators on image tables and study their properties. Finally, based on the properties of the operators identified, we derive algebraic rules that are useful for similarity based query optimization and we introduce a cost model for an implementation of one of the major similarity based operators.","","POD:0-7695-1140-6","10.1109/IDEAS.2001.938103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938103","","Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Content management;Data mining;EMP radiation effects;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Query processing","computer vision;information retrieval;multimedia databases;object-oriented databases;query processing;relational databases;visual databases","DBMSs;algebraic rules;computer vision;cost model;image data repository model;image tables;multimedia data;multimedia database systems;object-relational database paradigm;similarity based data retrieval techniques;similarity based operations;similarity based operators;similarity based query optimization;similarity based retrieval techniques","","1","1","20","","","16-18 July 2001","16 Jul 2001-18 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, we propose a number of modifications that can be made to these methods to allow for a better application to musical analysis. To this end, we first examine the practices of musical analysis. We focus on the field of extraction of motives. A common approach to this problem is to consider repetitions; whenever some part of the musical text is repeated, it can be considered as a motive. Detecting motives can either be based on a perfect match, or on inexact matching. To this end, the concept of similarity is introduced and analysed, and its meaning is defined in the scope of musical analysis. We also deal with the problem of the representation (or encoding) of the musical text.

Nevertheless, the above characteristics cannot be used in applications where the distributed management cannot do inferences that help it to know in what sites the data with some specific characteristics are located. Under these conditions the time and amount of work used by the participants in the query solution can be highly increased. In this paper we show an approach called the virtual fragmentation method.

In addition, an image similarity evaluation method based on the modified “Longest Common Subsequence” (LCS) algorithm is presented.

Portland International Conference on","20020807","2001","1","","84 vol.1","","Summary form only given. For many years document management systems have been equated with imaging systems which converted paper into digital documents for ease of storage and retrieval. Implementing such systems was relatively. simple as specifications for the system came from a handful of document authors who provided information on retrieval keys, distribution access requirements, etc. More recently, vendors of document management systems have proposed much broader. ramifications of documents. They recognized that the value of a document emanated from the knowledge stored therein and, that,knowledge had value primarily to users of the document as contrasted with the creators thereof. Those entrepreneurs reinvented document management as a user focused endeavor which could add value by furnishing the right document at the right time in the right place for a specific user. A new view which, seems to be a complete new context for firm-wide system development, is a complete enterprise model based upon a document view of the organization. This view relies on documents as the correct level of resolution for modeling the enterprise. This approach is based upon five axioms: documents record enterprise knowledge; documents define the enterprise workflow;documents provide the facts to manage people; documents structure computing systems; and documents guide enterprise change.","","POD:1-890843-06-7","10.1109/PICMET.2001.951787","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951787","","Focusing;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Pulp manufacturing;Virtual manufacturing","document handling;management","complete enterprise model;computing systems;document management systems;enterprise change;enterprise knowledge;enterprise modeling;enterprise workflow;firm-wide system development;imaging systems;people management;value creation tool","","1","1","","","","July 29 2001-Aug. 2 2001","29 Jul 2001-02 Aug 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, a few techniques exist to select a different subset of feature for each known class, which we refer to as discriminative feature selection. The main objective guiding discriminative feature selection has been the ultimate performance of the classifier system. Unsupervised learning, however, is plagued by the problem of absence of the class labels. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for fuzzy unsupervised learning in Web mining, for the case when the attributes/features do not have the same relevance in all clusters. Being a relative of the fuzzy c-means and k-means clustering algorithms, our approach is computationally and implementationally simple, and if desired, can easily be implemented in a scalable mode in an identical manner to previous well known scalable implementations of the k-means. Most importantly, our approach learns a different set of attribute weights for each cluster. The performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on real collections of Web documents and Web sessions extracted from a Web server log file.","","POD:0-7803-7461-4","10.1109/NAFIPS.2002.1018070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1018070","","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Frequency;Fuzzy sets;Information retrieval;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Unsupervised learning;Web mining;Web server","Internet;data mining;feature extraction;information retrieval;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","attribute discrimination;attribute relevance;category discovery;feature selection;fuzzy learning;simultaneous clustering;unsupervised learning;web data","","0","","22","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The idea of using raw speech as a watermark to enhance the robustness of the embedded watermark arises from the fact that raw speech contains a considerable amount of redundancies, and the bit content can still be recognized after the retrieval process, even if the watermarked data was badly attacked. As long as the raw speech, extracted from the attacked watermarked image frame, contains enough important information, its contents can still be intelligible. In the experiments, raw speech was embedded into an MPEG coded video stream, then attacks were simulated. After the embedded speech was extracted, a listening test was performed to evaluate the intelligibility of the extracted speech. The human perceptual system, as it tends to adjust and learn quickly to recognize the repeated speech, enhances the probability of recognizing the contents of the extracted raw speech precisely.

Attempts to use solar wavelength AVHRR data in community type differentiation have often resulted in unacceptable classification errors which are usually attributed to noise from topographic and soil background variations, inaccurate reflectance retrieval and poor registration. One source of variation which is rarely accounted for adequately is the directional signal resulting from the combined effects of the surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and the variation of viewing and illumination geometry as a function of scan angle, season, latitude and orbital overpass time. In this study, a linear semiempirical kernel-driven BRDF model is used to examine the utility:of the directional signal in community and cover type differentiation over discontinuous but statistically homogeneous semi-arid canopies in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, and New Mexico, USA.

To address this problem, we introduce the idea of a Match-all label for objects that failed these constraints. It serves to give them a defined labeling probability as well as allowing them participate in global correspondences through the compatibility model.

How do we learn to surf in the unbounded space of hyperlinks or the World Wide Web (WWW)? In order to effectively teach students new surfing skills we must be able to understand how neophyte Web users form the cognitive neurological networks that result in a mental pathway, or cognitive map, that makes more navigable the route to further information as well as the information they set out to find. A Markovian modeling of user behavior is introduced and compared to a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) that represents the opinions of experts on how users surf the Web. Experts are divided on what causes users to fail their queries on the Web. The paper shows that a viable FCM model can be developed and some limit-cycle equilibria are uncovered. A FCM limit cycle repeats a sequence of events and actions. Limit cycles can reveal cognitive and behavioral patterns of users on the Web. An adaptive FCM is built to reflect its causal behavior in time. This change reflects the user behavior as knowledge of the Web increases with time. The causal behavior learns from data. Users learn new patterns and reinforce old ones","","POD:0-7803-7078-3","10.1109/NAFIPS.2001.944291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=944291","","Books;Computer interfaces;Computer science;Educational institutions;Fuzzy cognitive maps;Information retrieval;Limit-cycles;Web search;Web sites;World Wide Web","Markov processes;education;fuzzy set theory;human factors;hypermedia;information resources;information retrieval;uncertainty handling;user modelling","FCM limit cycle;FCM model;Markovian modeling;WWW;Web searching skill mining;World Wide Web;adaptive FCM;behavioral patterns;causal behavior;cognitive map;cognitive neurological networks;college students;expert opinion;fuzzy cognitive state map;hyperspace;limit-cycle equilibria;mental pathway;neophyte Web users;surfing skills;user behavior","","1","","23","","","25-28 July 2001","25 Jul 2001-28 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The virtual scenes are dynamically generated from virtual scene models coded in a high-level XML-based language called X-VRML. The language consists of a set of XML tags introducing new elements to programming of virtual reality. These new elements include object-orientation, access to databases, and programming techniques known from procedural languages like variables, conditions, and loops. The X-VRML language overcomes the main limitations of current virtual reality systems. Use of X-VRML simplifies the code of virtual scene models, allows retrieval of data from databases, selection of virtual scene contents, customization of virtual scenes, and efficient coding of elements that have repetitive structure. Applications of X-VRML include on-line data visualization, geographical information systems, scientific visualization, virtual games, and e-commerce applications such as virtual shops","","POD:0-7695-1447-2","10.1109/SAINT.2002.994479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994479","","Content based retrieval;Data visualization;Information retrieval;Internet;Layout;Object oriented databases;Object oriented programming;Virtual reality;Visual databases;XML","Internet;distributed programming;hypermedia markup languages;object-oriented languages;object-oriented programming;virtual reality languages","Internet virtual reality applications;X-VRML;XML based modeling;XML tags;coding;conditions;data retrieval;database access;dynamic virtual scene generation;e-commerce;geographical information systems;high-level XML-based language;loops;object-orientation;on-line data visualization;procedural languages;programming;repetitive structure;scientific visualization;variables;virtual games;virtual scene content selection;virtual scene customization;virtual scene models;virtual shops","","5","4","8","","","2002","28 Jan 2002-01 Feb 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two important issues are the specification of a class of discriminatory and generalizable image features and determination of an appropriate image-dissimilarity measure to rank the closeness of the query image with respect to images in the database. The theoretically best set of features and dissimilarity measure are those which can be implemented with the lowest misregistration error rate. We study a method based on feature discrimination using feature coincidence trees and mutual α-information measures of feature correlation. Feature coincidence trees represent the commonality between pairs of images using joint histograms of many simple features, or tags, which are organized in a data structure similar to that of Y. Amit and D. Geman's randomized trees for shape recognition (see Neural Computation, vol.9, p.1545-88, 1997).

The authors propose a versatile wavelet-based data structure, 2D TSA-tree (Trend and Surprise Abstractions Tree), to enable efficient multi-level trend detection on spatial data at different levels. We show how 2D TSA-tree can be utilized efficiently for sub-region selections. Moreover, 2D TSA-tree can be utilized to precompute the reconstruction error and retrieval time of a data subset in advance in order to allow the user to trade off accuracy for response time (or vice versa) at query time. Finally, when the storage space is limited, our 2D Optimal TSA-tree saves on storage by storing only a specific optimal subset of the tree. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we evaluated our 2D TSA-tree using real and synthetic data.

As a result they rely on heuristics or schemas and fail to generate optimal outcomes in negotiation.

The purpose of the project is to make the cultural heritage of Teatro alla Scala available in digital form and allow efficient search and retrieval. The project started in 1997 at the Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale (LIM) of the University of Milan, Italy. All tapes, as well as scores, pictures, and videos of the Teatro alla Scala have been digitized and a retrieval system has been developed: the Musical Archive Information System (MAIS), which contains, among others, audio and video material from the Scala archives. Because of the nature of the data it contains, essentially multimedia, the development of the system has posed several challenges, of which the most interesting ones are described. In particular, the organization of the data is described, with particular emphasis on the treatment of musical data, together with the tools developed to provide content-based queries on musical materials from both the intranet and Internet theatre environments.","","POD:0-7695-1284-4","10.1109/WDM.2001.990158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990158","","Audio recording;Conducting materials;Cultural differences;Image retrieval;Information systems;Internet;Laboratories;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Music information retrieval","Internet;art;content-based retrieval;history;information retrieval systems;intranets;multimedia databases;music","Internet theatre environments;MAIS;Musical Archive Information System;Teatro alla Scala;Web-oriented environment querying;archive material;content-based queries;cultural heritage;data organization;digital form;intranet;multimedia database;multimedia musical heritage;music scores;musical data;musical materials;photographic pictures;retrieval system","","0","1","16","","","23-24 Nov. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, since Bayesian networks are defined solely upon the notion of probabilistic conditional independence, these encouraging results do not take advantage of the more general probabilistic independencies recently proposed. In this paper, we show how to exploit contextual independencies in both web search and user profiling. Whereas a conditional independence must hold over all contexts, a contextual independence need only hold for one particular context. For web search applications, it is shown how contextual independencies can be modeled using multiple Bayesian networks.

From a single agent's perspective, sending out as many queries as possible maximizes the chance of achieving the information sought. However, if every agent does the same, the information servers will be overloaded and most of the search agents won't be able to retrieve the information. Our previous results suggest that when behaviorally similar information-seeking agents cluster together, cooperation is promoted. In these experiments, the ranges of query (i.e., maximum logical distance from the information-seeking agents to potential information severs) is fixed for each search agent; agents only inquire the severs within the distance. The article evolves the range of the access distance. When similar agents (cooperators with cooperators and defectors with defectors), cluster together, cooperators tend to access diversified information sites while defectors tend to access only common information sites, resulting in high congestion. This phenomenon can be seen in human agents as well. When an agent sees too much competition or overuse of resource, it considers alternative choices. For example, when people see a congested highway, they tend to take other routes even if the routes may be longer. A similar phenomena is observed in our experiments.

The power of such an instantly indexed multimedia database system, in content-based retrieval of multimedia data or in semantic analysis and visualization of the data, far exceeds that of systems which index multimedia data only after it is produced.

Taking into consideration the performance characteristics of the tertiary storage devices and LOB retrieval, we propose a set of tertiary I/O scheduling algorithms, each of which employs a different heuristic for scheduling, reducing the latency involved in tertiary I/O for retrieving LOBs.

The proposed structure, called high-dimensional KDB-tree, eliminates downward propagation of splits associated with the original KDB-tree structure, which results in low storage utilization and rapid deterioration of the retrieval performance. Additional improvements in the storage and retrieval performance are achieved by removing certain redundant information from the interior nodes. Experimental results show that, in high-dimensional spaces, the proposed structure outperforms the original KDB-trees by a significant margin, while incurring no loss of performance in low-dimensional spaces.

The square matching error of two AGs subject to permutations is approximately relaxed to a square matching error of two AGs subject to orthogonal transformations.

The main problem in this task is the segmentation of the region of interest from the background. Viewing segmentation as a figure/ground segregation problem leads to a new approach-eliminating the background leaves the figure or object of interest. To find possible object colors, we first find background colors and eliminate them. We then use an edge image at an appropriate scale to eliminate those parts of the image which are not in focus and do not contain significant structures. The edge information is combined with the color-based background elimination to produce object (figure) regions. We test our approach on a database of bird images. We show that in 87% or 450 bird images tested, the segmentation is sufficient to determine the colors of the bird correctly for retrieval purposes. We also show that our approach provides improved retrieval performance","","POD:0-7695-1143-0","10.1109/ICCV.2001.937647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937647","","Birds;Focusing;Image databases;Image generation;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Testing","database indexing;image colour analysis;image segmentation;visual databases","bird images;database;domain specific databases;edge image;indexing;object colors;retrieval;segmentation","","4","","14","","","2001","07 Jul 2001-14 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach discards irrelevant areas or noise in a video frame from being used in the segmentation process to increase the accuracy of the segmentation. Unlike existing techniques, video frames are first noise-reduced and only relevant information is left for subsequent steps of the segmentation process. Our experimental results indicate that a seamless integration of our simple noise filter to an existing scene segmentation technique offers a non-negligible improvement in the segmentation accuracy (i.e., as much as 59% less falsely detected scenes)","","POD:0-7695-1062-0","10.1109/ITCC.2001.918801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918801","","Computer aided instruction;Computer science;Databases;Information retrieval;Internetworking;Layout;Multimedia computing;Software libraries;Video compression;Video on demand","content-based retrieval;image segmentation;very large databases;video databases","automatic video segmentation;experimental results;large video databases;noise filter;noise-reduction scene segmentation;video browsing;video frame;video retrieval","","0","","15","","","Apr 2001","02 Apr 2001-04 Apr 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the emergence of new business applications and business-to-business (B2B) makes it necessary to build portals not only based on data integration together with restricted query facilities such as developed for B2C, but based on data (hosted locally or in Web sites) and application integration instead. Building such a portal requires accessing and manipulating data extracted from flat files or databases, documents retrieved from the Web as well as data generated by any application available locally or at the Web site. We present an approach to wrapping Web data sources, databases, flat files, or data generated by tools through a database view mechanism. Generally a wrapper has two tasks: it first sends a query to the source to retrieve data and, secondly builds the expected output with respect to the virtual structure. Our wrappers are composed of a retrieval component based on an intermediate object view mechanism called search views mapping the source capabilities to attributes, and a XML extractor to perform respectively these two tasks. The originality of the approach consists of: (1) a generic view mechanism to seamlessly access data sources, and (2) the ability to wrap data sources as well as the useful specific tools they may provide.

"Improving the retrieval performance of content-based image retrieval systems: the GIVBAC approach","L. Brocker; M. Bogen; A. B. Cremers","German Nat. Res. Center for Inf.

The problem of missing semantical information about the images leads to great numbers of false matches because of misleading similarities in the visual primitives that are retrieved. This paper introduces an approach called GIVBAC, that tries to reduce the number of false matches in query result sets. It relies heavily on user feedback on retrieval results with regard to user-definable thematic groups.

These techniques assume two-class relevance feedback, relevant and irrelevant. While simple computationally, two-class relevance feedback often becomes inadequate in providing sufficient information to help rapidly improve retrieval performance. We propose a locally adaptive technique for content-based image retrieval that enables relevance feedback to take on multi-class form. For each given query, we estimate local feature relevance based on Chi-squared analysis using information provided by multiclass relevance feedback. Local feature relevance is then used to compute a flexible metric that is highly adaptive to query locations. As a result, local data distributions can be sufficiently exploited, whereby rapid performance improvement can be achieved.

Accurate quantitative determination of similarity between XML documents provides an important basis for a variety of applications of XML document mining and processing.

We also investigate distance measures in the space of histograms which are defined by quadratic forms and which take into account the geometric structure of the underlying color space.

The authors propose optimisations for phrase querying with a nextword index, an efficient structure for phrase based searching. We show that careful consideration of which search terms are evaluated in a query plan and optimisation of the order of evaluation of the plan can reduce query evaluation costs by more than a factor of five.

We intend to fully automate the training of the routing matrix while still maintaining the same level of performance (over 90% accuracy) as that in an optimized system. Two specific issues are investigated: (1) reducing the matrix size by removing word pairs and triplets in key term definition while using only single word terms; and (2) increasing the matrix size by removing the need for defining stop words and performing stop word filtering. Since simplification of design often implies a degradation of performance, discriminative training of routing matrix parameters becomes an essential procedure. We show in our experiments that the performance degradation caused by relaxing the design constraints can be compensated entirely by minimum error classification (MCE) training even with the above two simplifications.

This is integrated with a vector-space information retrieval model to achieve speech retrieval. This paper proposes an approach for automatic story segmentation from television news programs, intended to replace hand-segmentation as described above. Automatic story segmentation is critical for rapid expansion of our video archive. Our approach relies on the assumption that nearly all the news stories follow the temporal syntax of (begin-story → anchor shots → field shots → end-story). Therefore, our algorithm aims to detect field-to-anchor shot boundaries that should also coincide with the story boundaries.

On the other hand, in many networked application domains users need to access any type of data, preferably with a single tool. However, DDBM is still a challenging research area that involves bridging syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of data as well as of functionality, especially in the bottom-up design of a new DDB. Since, existing DDBM systems were usually built by focusing on the implementation of some dedicated protocols for DDBM, they are inflexible for major modifications or exchange of the protocols. In addition, their software architecture usually does not comply with well-known design paradigms, which could facilitate the maintenance of the software system. We present an agent-based approach for flexible DDBM, where independent DDBM protocols are modular exchangeable for lest purposes. This capability of the DDBMS provides for flexibility against protocol heterogeneity and enables the DDBMS to communicate with new DBMSs to be included, by combining or adapting its protocols at run time. For instance, different DDB consistency levels are possible for different DDBs with the same DDBMS. In this work, the design of DDBM in form of a multi-agent system of the AgentTeam framework is discussed, particularly the dynamic reconfigurable transaction management model. Furthermore, the CourseMan prototype is described, which is implemented in form of a test-bed that provides a homogeneous environment for testing different DDBM protocols, upon heterogeneous DBMSs","","POD:0-7695-0987-8","10.1109/EMPDP.2001.905051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905051","","Database systems;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Prototypes;Software architecture;Software design;Software maintenance;Testing","distributed databases;multi-agent systems;transaction processing","AgentTeam;distributed database management systems;heterogeneous DBMSs;information retrieval systems;multi-agent system;re-configurable transaction management;relational data;transaction management","","0","1","27","","","2001","07 Feb 2001-09 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we consider watermark generation and the rule used to insert the watermark within the host features. By adopting again a communication perspective, some useful hints are given on the way the watermark should be shaped and inserted within the host document for increased robustness against attacks. Given that invisibility is one of the main requirements a watermark must satisfy, the way psycho-visual notions can be used to effectively hide the watermark within an image is carefully reviewed.

This is because of both intra and inter lobject time dependencies. Intraobject time dependency refers to the real-time display requirement of a continuous media object. Interobject time dependency is the temporal relationships defined among multiple continuous media objects. In order to compose tailored multimedia presentations, a user might define complex time dependencies among multiple continuous media objects with various lengths and display bandwidths. Scheduling the retrieval tasks corresponding to the components of such a presentation in order to respect both inter and intra task time dependencies is the focus of this study. To tackle this task scheduling problem (CRS), we start with a simpler scheduling problem (ARS) where there is no inter task time dependency (e.g., movie-on-demand). Next, we investigate an augmented version of ARS (termed ARS<sup>+</sup>) where requests reserve displays in advance (e.g., reservation-based movie-on-demand). Finally, we extend our techniques proposed for ARS and ARS<sup>+</sup> to address the CRS problem. We also provide formal definition of these scheduling problems and proof of their NP-hardness","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/69.991729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991729","","Bandwidth;Displays;Information retrieval;Information systems;Multimedia systems","computational complexity;information retrieval;knowledge engineering;multimedia systems","NP-hardness;atomic media objects scheduling;complex time dependencies;composite continuous media objects scheduling;continuous media objects retrievals;interobject time dependency;intraobject time dependency;multiple continuous media objects;multiuser multimedia information systems;real-time display requirement;task scheduling problem;temporal relationships","","5","","29","","","Mar/Apr 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The statistical scheme leads to a new wavelet-based texture retrieval method that is based on the accurate modeling of the marginal distribution of wavelet coefficients using generalized Gaussian density (GGD) and on the existence a closed form for the KLD between GGDs. The proposed method provides greater accuracy and flexibility in capturing texture information, while its simplified form has a close resemblance with the existing methods which uses energy distribution in the frequency domain to identify textures.

Unlike document clustering algorithms in IR that are based on common words/phrases shared among documents, our approach is based on common links shared by pages. We also extend the standard clustering algorithm, K-means, to make it more natural to handle noise and apply it to Web search results. By filtering some irrelevant pages, our approach clusters high quality pages in Web search results into semantically meaningful groups to facilitate users accessing and browsing. Preliminary experiments and evaluations are conducted to investigate its effectiveness.

We examine two query representation combination approaches (title + description and title + narrative) for 150 queries from TREC 6, 7 and 8 topics.

The objective is to design a code of which the correction power is enhanced if some information symbols are known to the decoder. Such a form of channel coding we call “coding for informed decoders”. A possible application is in the field of address retrieval on optical media. The sector address on optical media is part of a header which is protected by an error correcting code. Under many circumstances much of the header information of the current sector can be inferred from the previously read sectors and the table of contents. The application of coding for informed decoders to sector header protection allows for reliable local address retrieval, which is especially important during writing.
