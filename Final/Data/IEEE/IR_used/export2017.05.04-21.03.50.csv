The improved capabilities of HJ-1B data offer an opportunity for the computation of subpixel fire temperature and fire area. The simulated HJ-1B MIR and TIR channel images are used in this paper for the algorithm test. Fires with various sizes and temperatures are simulated in a wide range of terrestrial biomes and climates conditions by MODTRAN 4. A bispectral method developed by L. Giglio and J. D. Kendall is adopted to retrieve the temperature and area of a subpixel fire within an otherwise homogeneous pixel. It is evident that HJ-1B satellite data are more sensitive to the smaller and the cooler fires than that of MODIS or AVHRR Data. For the HJ-1B data, if the fire area is about 450 m<sup>2</sup> and fire temperature is about 1000 K, it can also offer a capability of retrieving the fire temperature and area in a relatively high accuracy. It has been demonstrated that the accuracy will increase with the growing fire area or temperature.

The AIRS Science Team Version 5 retrieval algorithm contains two significant improvements over Version 4: 1) Improved physics allows for use of AIRS observations in the entire 4.3 mum CO<sub>2</sub> absorption band in the retrieval of temperature profile T(p) during both day and night. Tropospheric sounding 15 mum CO<sub>2</sub> observations are now used primarily in the generation of cloud cleared radiances Rcirc<sub>i</sub>. This approach allows for the generation of accurate values of Rcirc<sub>i</sub> and T(p) under most cloud conditions. 2) Another very significant improvement in Version 5 is the ability to generate accurate case-by-case, level-by-level error estimates for the atmospheric temperature profile, as well as for channel-by-channel error estimates for Rcirc<sub>i</sub>. These error estimates are used for quality control of the retrieved products. We have conducted forecast impact experiments assimilating AIRS temperature profiles with different levels of quality control using the NASA GEOS-5 data assimilation system. Assimilation of quality controlled T(p) resulted in significantly improved forecast skill compared to that obtained from analyses obtained when all data used operationally by NCEP, except for AIRS data, is assimilated. We also conducted an experiment assimilating AIRS radiances uncontaminated by clouds, as done operationally by ECMWF and NCEP. Forecast resulting from assimilated AIRS radiances were of poorer quality than those obtained assimilating AIRS temperatures.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2808-3; POD:978-1-4244-2807-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4779002","AIRS/AMSU;Data Assimilation;NWP;Quality Control;Temperature Profile","Absorption;Clouds;Data assimilation;Error correction;Information retrieval;NASA;Ocean temperature;Physics;Quality control;Temperature control","atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;data assimilation;remote sensing;troposphere;weather forecasting","AIRS Science Team Version 5 retrieval algorithm;CO2 absorption band;Goddard DAAC;atmospheric temperature profile;cloud cleared radiances;data assimilation;forecast skill;quality control;temperature soundings;tropospheric sounding;wavelength 15 mum;wavelength 4.3 mum","","0","","","","","7-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web services decouple objects that are platform specific and facilitate interactions among platform independent objects, which are able to access data from anywhere on the Web. They rely on loose, rather than tight coupling among the web components which enables a flexible and dynamic interchange in open, distributed web environments. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provides a platform for government organizations, academia, and industry to come to a consensus and standardization of geospatial technologies. This paper proposes that image information mining systems need standardization in terms of OGC specifications and in describing the IIM framework in an OGC perspective.

The model assumes two scattering centers in each image pixel. The study shows that if one component remains linearly polarized, while the other is fully depolarized, then meaningful interferometric information can still be retrieved for the linearly polarized scattering center. However, if the depolarized component is also spatially decorrelated (loss of spatial coherence), then the interferometric phase estimates of both components are prone to significant errors.

A tremendous amount of data is currently available from which to begin analysis. With CALIOP's sensitivity to polarization at 532 nm, such dust layers are easily identified by significant amounts of depolarization relative to other aerosol types due to the non-sphericity of dust particles. Dust aerosols represent an interesting basis upon which to examine the performance of the CRAM technique, and in particular its dust model, due to the fact that dust is distinctly identifiable from depolarization.

The existence of this changing background will make retrieving prompt neutron information immediately after the flash problematic. The tail accumulation is accentuated for every pulse in the flash, making the time just after the last pulse in the flash the worst possible time to measure prompt neutron data. Obtaining prompt neutron data during the flash—particularly near the beginning of the flash, where background tail accumulation is minimal—is feasible if shielding is used to control the count rates, but requires fast gamma-neutron pulse shape discrimination.

One obstacle to high-speed testing is the time cost of feature extraction for test objects, particularly for objects with complex representation such as images, videos and audios. In this paper, we study the problem of reducing test time cost by extracting cheap but sufficient features. We propose the TEFE (time-efficient feature extraction) approach, which balances between the test accuracy and test time cost by extracting a proper subset of features for each test object. In the implementation, TEFE trains a sequence of support vector machines and classifies each test object cascadingly. Empirical study shows that TEFE is time efficient while holding a classification accuracy close to that of using all features.

Component temperatures inversion and leaf area index (LAI) inversion all have close relations with the vegetation fraction cover. The objective of this study is to develop a method to estimate the vegetation cover fraction from satellite observation. Traditional methods of inferring vegetation fraction cover from satellite remote sensing include spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and scaled normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Those methods often rely on a series of steps in the processing chain, including atmospheric correction, surface angular correction and so on. Generally, those procedures are very computationally demanding. In addition, the errors associated with each procedure may be accumulated and significantly affect to the accuracy of the final products. In this study, a new retrieval methodology is proposed to calculate vegetation fraction cover over mixed pixels directly from the AATSR spectral reflectance data at top-of-atmosphere (TOA). The method consists of extensive radiative transfer simulations under a wide variety of solar illumination and sensor view conditions, atmospheric profiles, aerosol types and conditions and vegetation canopy leaf angle distributions. The derivation of vegetation fraction cover from TOA observations requires several steps of processing.Important steps include, (1) Preparing for the model input variables: foliage and soil spectral data on red, green and near-infrared bands which measured from two kinds of vegetation and three kinds of soil in the field experiment; (2) Generating a database based on a canopy radiative transfer model, Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL), and a hybrid linear model with the spectral data combined with vegetation geometric construction data and observation geometric data; (3)Atmospheric correction that converts surface ensemble reflectance to TOA ensemb- - le reflectance based on a radiative transfer model, Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar (6S); (4) Mapping the relationships between spectral directional ensemble reflectance and vegetation fraction cover through a nonlinear regress method. The correction coefficients of the surface vegetation fraction cover computed with AATSR are provided.vegetation fraction cover retrieval from TOA data of AATSR does not exceed by 6% at nadir view and 9.7% at forward view, respectively. The performances of input parameters on estimates of vegetation fraction cover are given compared with the ""true"" surface vegetation fraction cover.

Current climate models usually use simplified approaches to calculate albedo and can not take sub-grid heterogeneity into account. For heterogeneous land areas, retrieving large scale surface albedo by using current albedo characterization schemes can cause considerably spatial scaling bias. The scaling biases in the albedo estimation processes mainly result from overlooking sub-pixel variability of land surface characteristics and non-linear relationships between albedo and related parameters. The objective is to establish a new methodology to further reduce spatial scaling bias of surface albedo at coarse resolution. Contexture-based and texture-based methods were applied to remove spatial scaling bias. In addition, a new method, dealing with spatial variation of between and within land cover type, was proposed and applied. The results indicate that lumped albedo value can be considerably biased from the distributed albedo (about 20% on average).

It enumerates all subgraphs of a single given query graph which are frequent geometric epsi-subgraphs under the entire class of rigid geometric transformations in a database. By using geometric epsi-subgraphs, we achieve tolerance against variations in geometry. We compare the proposed algorithm to gSpan on chemical compound data, and we show that for a given minimum support the total number of frequent patterns is substantially limited by requiring geometric matching. Although the computation time per pattern is larger than for non-geometric graph mining, the total time is within a reasonable level even for small minimum support.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:978-0-7695-3502-9","10.1109/ICDM.2008.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781207","frequent graph mining;geometric graph mining;geometric patterns","Chemical compounds;Chemistry;Drugs;Geometry;Information retrieval;Pattern matching;Polynomials;Proteins;Spatial databases;Statistics","data mining;database management systems;geometry;graph theory;query processing","3D geometric coordinates;chemical compound data;geometric frequent subgraph retrieval;geometric graph databases;knowledge discovery;query graph","","1","","21","","","15-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This plays an important role in the prediction of erosion, flood or drought. Passive microwave remote sensing data has great potential for providing estimates of soil moisture. This is mainly due to the minimal weather influence on passive microwave data and its ability to penetrate through clouds. The artificial neural network (ANN) is a method that tries simulates human intelligence by crudely imitating the way a human brain learns. This method has been especially useful for mapping non-linear and ill-posed problems. Soil moisture retrieval is an example of a non-linear problem. An explicit inverse of the physical process can be built using an ANN to map the passive microwave measurements into land surface parameters such as soil moisture. For this paper, the ANN method used to create the explicit inverse function is divided into (i.) single parameter retrieval of the soil moisture value given the passive microwave measurements, and (ii.) multi-parameter retrieval of a number of land surface parameters, i.e. soil temperature, surface roughness, together with soil moisture value given the passive microwave measurements. This paper examines these methods in the context of retrieving surface soil moisture values given microwave radiometric data and discusses key issues that will need to be addressed to improve mapping performance and to produce operational systems.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2808-3; POD:978-1-4244-2807-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779086","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4779086","Inverse Problems;Neural networks;Review;Soil Moisture","Artificial neural networks;Humans;Information retrieval;Land surface;Microwave measurements;Microwave theory and techniques;Moisture measurement;Passive microwave remote sensing;Soil measurements;Soil moisture","geophysical signal processing;hydrological techniques;hydrology;inverse problems;neural nets;radiometry;rain;remote sensing;rivers;soil","artificial neural network;drought;erosion;explicit inverse function;flood;microwave radiometry;nonlinear mapping;passive microwave remote sensing;rainfall;runoff;soil moisture retrieval;soil temperature;surface roughness;water infiltration","","0","","12","","","7-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, mashups introduce a new class of integration technologies for implementing situational applications (i.e. applications that come together for solving some immediate business problems). While mashup services provide flexibility and speed in delivering new valuable services to consumers, the issue of accountability associated with the mashups remains largely ignored by the industry. Pushing mashups to enterprises without attention to accountability problems involves many risks. In this paper, a new model is proposed to resolve accountability issues in mashup services. The proposed model uses PKI (public key infrastructure) in conjunction with logically hierarchical meta Web services to support identification and traceability of Web services in mashups and consequently provides a trusted environment for enterprise mashups.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3473-2","10.1109/APSCC.2008.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780709","Accountability;Mashups;Web Service","Application software;Industrial engineering;Information retrieval;Law;Legal factors;Mashups;Public key;Service oriented architecture;Web and internet services;Web services","Web services;public key cryptography","PKI;Web applications;accountability;enterprise mashups;logically hierarchical meta Web services;mashup services;public key infrastructure","","1","","17","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The former isoline equations were all derived by truncating the terms of photons which went through the interactions between canopy and soil layers more than once. The improvement is achieved by accounting the terms of higher order interactions which were neglected in the former derivations. As a result, the final form of the isoline equation becomes quadratic due to the inclusions of the second order interaction term. The numerical results indicates clearly that the accuracy, defined as difference of the derived isolines from the true isolines which includes all the interaction terms, was improved significantly from the former isoline equations by adding only one more interaction term (the second order interaction) only in the near-infrared band. It is concluded that higher accuracy can be achieved by adding one more term during the derivation while retaining the final form relatively simple.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2808-3; POD:978-1-4244-2807-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4779535","LAI;canopy RT model;fraction of vegetation cover;inversion;vegetation isoline","Difference equations;Differential equations;Information retrieval;Information science;Linear approximation;Reflectivity;Soil;Space technology;Vegetation","atmospheric boundary layer;geophysics computing;information retrieval;reflectivity;vegetation","canopy;reflectance;soil layer;vegetation biophysical parameters retrieval;vegetation isoline equations","","1","","5","","","7-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, to our best knowledge, no previous study has leveraged the rank information for subspace learning in ranking tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called learning latent semantics for ranking (LLSR), to seek the optimal latent semantic space tailored to the ranking tasks. We first present a dual explanation for the classical latent semantic indexing (LSI) algorithm, namely learning the so-called latent semantic space (LSS) to encode the data information. Then, to handle the increasing amount of training data for the practical ranking tasks, we propose a novel objective function to derive the optimal LSS for ranking. Experimental results on two SMART sub-collections and a TREC dataset show that LLSR effectively improves the ranking performance compared with the classical LSI algorithm and ranking without subspace learning.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:978-0-7695-3502-9","10.1109/ICDM.2008.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781234","Latent Semantic Space;Ranking","Asia;Data engineering;Data mining;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Routing;Text analysis;Text mining;Training data","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","latent semantic indexing;latent semantic space;ranking task;subspace learning technique;text analysis;text retrieval;trained data handling","","0","1","20","","","15-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the number of blog entries and contributors (bloggers) grows at a very fast pace, they are increasingly filling the Web space. Thus effective search in the blogspace become more important. For effective search, the page ranking algorithm is one of the most critical techniques. Blogs have the structural features, which do not exist in the traditional Web, such as trackback links, tags, comments. For this reason, the page ranking algorithms for the traditional Web may not work effectively in the blogspace. In this paper, we propose a new ldquotrackback-rankrdquo algorithm which considers the features of blogs for more effective blog search. We evaluate bloggers' authority, trackback connectivity, and users' reactivity in order to rank blog entries. These factors are created and modified by the interaction among blog users. The blog users read and evaluate contents of blog entries and then interaction other users. Thereby, these factors implicitly reflect the contents quality of the entries, and the trackback-rank algorithm could improve the relevance of the search result to the queries. Our experiments on a collection of 62,906 blog entries shows that the trackback-rank algorithm can more effectively find relevant information compared to the traditional ranking algorithm.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2824-3; POD:978-1-4244-2823-6","10.1109/INMIC.2008.4777781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4777781","Blog;Link-analysis;Ranking;Search engine;Tag;Trackback;Weblog","Engines;Information retrieval;Information services;Internet;Publishing;Web pages;Web search;Web sites","Web sites;information retrieval","blog search;blogspace;page ranking algorithm;trackback-rank algorithm","","0","","11","","","23-24 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For bathymetry retrieval, the lower limit is the very shallow water case (here defined as < 2m), a depth zone which is not well resolved by many existing bathymetric LIDAR sensors, such as SHOALS [4]. The ability to rapidly model these shallow water depths from HSI directly has potential benefits for combined HSI/LIDAR systems such as the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey (CHARTS) [10]. In this study, we focused on the validation of a near infra-red feature, corresponding to a local minimum in absorption (and therefore a local peak in reflectance), which can be correlated directly to bathymetry with a high degree of confidence. Compared to other VNIR wavelengths, this particular near-IR feature corresponds to a peak in the correlation with depth in this very shallow water regime, and this is a spectral range where reflectance depends primarily on water depth (water absorption) and bottom type, with suspended constituents playing a secondary role.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2808-3; POD:978-1-4244-2807-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4778943","Hydrolight;IOP;Virginia Coast Reserve;bottom type;hyperspectral;shallow-water bathymetry","Electromagnetic wave absorption;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Laser radar;Oceanographic techniques;Reflectivity;Sea measurements;Water","bathymetry;geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;optical radar;remote sensing by radar;underwater optics","CHARTS;Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey;LIDAR sensors;Naval Research Laboratory;SHOALS;VNIR wavelengths;Virginia Coast Reserve;hyperspectral imagery;in-water optical property;multi-sensor campaign;near-IR feature;remote retrieval;shallow water depths;very shallow water bathymetry retrieval;water absorption","","3","","10","","","7-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first step in the information extraction process is thus to locate within a limited period of time as many Web pages as possible that contain relevant information, a task which is commonly accomplished by applying focused crawling techniques. The performance of such a crawler can be measured by its ""recall"", i.e. the percentage of documents found and identified as relevant compared to the number of existing documents. A higher recall value implies that more redundant data is available, which in turn leads to better results in the subsequent fact extraction phase. In this paper, we propose xCrawl, a new focused crawling method which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with respect to recall values achievable within a given period of time. This method is based on a new combination of ideas and techniques used to identify and exploit navigational structures of Websites, such as hierarchies, lists or maps. In addition, automatic query generation is applied to rapidly collect Web sources containing target documents. The proposed crawling technique was inspired by the requirements of a Web mining system developed to extract product and service descriptions and was evaluated in different application scenarios. Comparisons with existing focused crawling techniques reveal that the new crawling method leads to a significant increase in recall whilst maintaining precision.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:978-0-7695-3502-9","10.1109/ICDM.2008.121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781150","Web mining;authorative sources;focused crawling","Crawlers;Data mining;Digital cameras;Information retrieval;Navigation;Time measurement;Uniform resource locators;Web mining;Web pages","Internet;Web sites;data mining;document handling;information retrieval","Web documents;Web mining;Web sites;automatic information extraction;high-recall crawling method;xCrawl","","0","","19","","","15-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because the manifold coordinates are intrinsic, they offer the potential for significant compression of the data, and are furthermore very useful for displaying data structure that can not be seen by linear image processing representations when the data is inherently nonlinear. This is especially true, for example, when the data are known to contain strong nonlinearities, such as in the reflectance data obtained from hyperspectral imaging sensors over the water, where the medium itself is attenuating. These representations are also potentially useful in such applications as anomaly finding.

Inst. of Inf., Tokyo","2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining","20090210","2008","","","383","392","Searching for images of people is an essential task for image and video search engines. However, current search engines have limited capabilities for this task since they rely on text associated with images and video, and such text is likely to return many irrelevant results. We propose a method for retrieving relevant faces of one person by learning the visual consistency among results retrieved from text correlation-based search engines. The method consists of two steps. In the first step, each candidate face obtained from a text-based search engine is ranked with a score that measures the distribution of visual similarities among the faces. Faces that are possibly very relevant or irrelevant are ranked at the top or bottom of the list, respectively. The second step improves this ranking by treating this problem as a classification problem in which input faces are classified as psilaperson-Xpsila or psilanon-person-Xpsila; and the faces are re-ranked according to their relevant score inferred from the classifierpsilas probability output. To train this classifier, we use a bagging-based framework to combine results from multiple weak classifiers trained using different subsets. These training subsets are extracted and labeled automatically from the rank list produced from the classifier trained from the previous step. In this way, the accuracy of the ranked list increases after a number of iterations. Experimental results on various face sets retrieved from captions of news photos show that the retrieval performance improved after each iteration, with the final performance being higher than those of the existing algorithms.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:978-0-7695-3502-9","10.1109/ICDM.2008.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781133","ensemble learning;face annotation;face retrieval;unsupervised learning;visual consistency","Data mining;Density measurement;Face recognition;Image databases;Informatics;Information retrieval;Lighting;Search engines;Unsupervised learning;Videoconference","data mining;face recognition;pattern classification;search engines;visual databases","Web mining;image search engines;multiple weak classifiers;text-correlation-based search engines;unsupervised face annotation;video search engines","","9","3","21","","","15-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Problems arise when in situ data are either not available or of low quality or the observables present spatial variations.

This approach is performed over PSPL to consider the multiple hypotheses generated by ASR process, as well as the position information for these hypotheses, so as to alleviate the problem of relatively poor ASR accuracy.

The general framework of IMDAS includes the Lin ice cloud microphysics scheme as a model operator, a 4-stream fast microwave radiative transfer model (RTM) in the atmosphere as an observation operator, and a global minimization method known as Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE). The IMDAS assimilates the satellite microwave radiometer data set of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and retrieves integrated water vapor (IWV) and integrated cloud liquid water content (ICLWC). This new method successfully introduces the heterogeneity into the initial state of the atmosphere, and the modeled microwave brightness temperatures agree well with observations of Wakasa Bay Experiment 2003 in Japan.
