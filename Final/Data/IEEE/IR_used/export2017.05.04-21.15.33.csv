However, handling fingerprint distortion is still a problem. This paper concentrates on a more accurate fingerprint indexing algorithm that efficiently retrieves the top <i>N</i> possible matching candidates from a huge database. To this end, we design a novel feature based on minutia neighborhood structure (we call this minutia detail and it contains richer minutia information) and a more stable triangulation algorithm (low-order Delaunay triangles, consisting of order 0 and 1 Delaunay triangles), which are both insensitive to fingerprint distortion. The indexing features include minutia detail and attributes of low-order Delaunay triangle (its handedness, angles, maximum edge, and related angles between orientation field and edges). Experiments on databases FVC2002 and FVC2004 show that the proposed algorithm considerably narrows down the search space in fingerprint databases and is stable for various fingerprints. We also compared it with other indexing approaches, and the results show our algorithm has better performance, especially on fingerprints with distortion.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2007.910242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4380301","Fingerprint distortion;fingerprint indexing;low-order Delaunay triangle;minutia detail;order <formula formulatype=""inline""><tex>$k$</tex> </formula>-Delaunay triangulation;triplet","Algorithm design and analysis;Character recognition;Computer science;Delay;Fingerprint recognition;Indexing;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Robustness;Spatial databases","database indexing;fingerprint identification;image matching;mesh generation;visual databases","automatic fingerprint identification system;fingerprint database;fingerprint distortion;fingerprint indexing;image matching;low-order Delaunay triangle;minutia neighborhood structure","","48","1","23","","","Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although several techniques can be employed to reduce this number, the final figure is still high thus leading to a feature space of high dimensionality.

To represent leaf shape, we first derive a distance curve from each leaf using distances between its center and the points along the contour. Next, for the storage and matching purpose, we extract a set of Fourier Coefficients (FCs) from the curve. Typically, a set of FCs fails to restore the original curve completely. In order to reduce the difference between original and restored curves, we divide whole curve into several partitions such that each partition has a small difference with the original curve. For image matching, we propose a Partial Dynamic Time Warping (PDTW) algorithm. We also propose a categorization scheme using the number of unit curves for filtering purpose.

Even though a number of works have focused on this topic so far, no temporal aspect of 3D graphical data has been taken into account. Especially no complete automatic metadata extraction process has been proposed. A manual process is possible with a small amount of 3D graphical data while impossible with a larger amount. Therefore, the manual process gets heavy and the cost in time and effort is so much required. In such a context, we introduce for 3D graphical data a temporal meta database system where an automatic metadata extraction method takes into consideration the temporal aspect of 3D graphical data. 3D graphical data is arranged in a scene formatted in the standard language VRML. Semantic information of the scene, i.e. metadata, will be automatically achieved. The structure of scene metadata is handled by using the temporal NIAM object oriented conceptual schema model at the abstraction level so that the semantic scene information can get more understandable to users, graphics designers, and application programmers as well. As a result, scene metadata is able to be easily stored and queried by means of some standardized database language such as SQL or OQL. With the aid of the extracted scene metadata, the respective 3D scenes are now exactly and conveniently accessed by other applications such as a virtual guide in transportation, architecture, tourism, etc.","","POD:0-7695-2983-6","10.1109/CIT.2007.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4385073","","Costs;Data mining;Database languages;Database systems;Graphics;Information retrieval;Layout;Object oriented modeling;Programming profession;Transportation","computer graphics;meta data;temporal databases;visual databases","3D graphical data;metadata extraction process;semantic information;temporal meta database system","","3","","16","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among the different methods, deterministic phase-code multiplexing has been widely investigated since it entails several advantages. This method allows recording and retrieval of data pages without introducing moving parts or frequency-shifting elements into the setup, which results in a fast access speed. Crosstalk analyses have shown that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of phase-code multiplexing is significantly higher than those of wavelength or angle multiplexing.

Queries are expected to be answered as efficiently and effectively as in traditional keyword search, while satisfying additional constraints. Several XML-retrieval systems support answering queries exhaustively by storing both structural indexes and a keyword index. Other systems answer top-k queries efficiently by constructing indexes in which keyword scores, for some structural elements, are stored in relevance order, enabling approaches such as the threshold algorithm (TA). In this paper we describe TReX an XML retrieval system that can exploit multiple structural summaries (including newly defined ones). TReX can also self-manage small, redundant, indexes to speed up the evaluation of workloads of top-k queries. The redundant indexes are maintained to enable TReX to select an evaluation strategies among three (and potentially more) retrieval methods. We provide experimental evidence that using several strategies improves the efficiency of query evaluation, since none of the retrieval methods outperforms the others in all cases.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0832-0; POD:978-1-4244-0831-3","10.1109/ICDEW.2007.4400999","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4400999","","Algebra;Content based retrieval;Filtering;Humans;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Proposals;Query processing;XML","XML;indexing;query processing","TReX;XML data management;XML retrieval;keyword index;query evaluation;retrieval queries;self managing top-k indexes;structural elements;threshold algorithm","","1","","18","","","17-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Optical music recognition (OMR) is a form of structured document image analysis where music symbols are isolated and identified so that the music can be conveniently processed. While OMR systems perform well on printed scores, current methods for reading handwritten musical scores by computers remain far from ideal. One of the fundamental stages of this process is the staff line detection. In this paper a new method for the automatic detection of music stave lines based on a shortest path approach is presented.

Generic SANETs usually require that a sizeable code be deployed on the nodes regardless of the specific requirements of the application at hand. More important, they may not be optimized to fully exploit the specific characteristics and query patterns of a given application. In this article we introduce service-oriented SANETs (SOSANETs) as a novel approach to building customizable SANETs. SOSANETs provide the benefits of both application-specific SANETs (e.g., energy efficiency, scalability) and generic SANETs (e.g., reusability) and avoid most of their limitations. We implemented our approach in TinySOA, a SOSANET developed on top of TinyOS. We conducted an evaluation of TinySOA that included a comparison with TinyDB, an established query processing system for sensor networks.

Then classification model is estimated by a mixture model combined with this semantic smoothing method. Ontology-based document representation can deal with synonym and reduce the concept vector. The semantic smoothing method can partly solve the sparseness of data. Our method is evaluated on OHSUMED and genomic track collection, and proper results were attained.

When the answers of a query or search are varying in quality and are large in numbers, it is necessary to rank/order these answers based on some criteria. From a users' viewpoint, ranking is extremely useful especially when associated with the retrieval of a few (top-k) answers. Currently, the notion of ranking is being applied to database query answers (ordering based on user criteria) in order to retrieve top-k answers. One of the challenges is to push ranking computation into the query processing stage to make it efficient and eliminate post processing operations. In this paper, we argue that top-k answers and ranking will become mandatory as well for searches that involve integration of information from heterogeneous domains. However, it is not clear how ranking can be supported as sources are autonomous and support different characteristics and capabilities. We analyze possible alternatives for supporting ranking while answering queries in this context and propose potential approaches.

The already completed ISO/IEC IS 15938, formally called the multimedia content description interface (better known as MPEG-7), provides a rich model for multimedia content description. We propose a unified query framework for multimedia repositories based on MPEG-7. The framework consists of a query language and a service interface. The query language is based on XML and includes four complementary parts defining a relational-like algebra, an expression language, an input query structure and the output response format. The service interface acts as a set of views over the query language and is based in two different bindings: An extensible web services-based (SOAP) binding and an alternative and simple HTTP (REST-like) interface.","","POD:0-7695-3030-3","10.1109/AXMEDIS.2007.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4402885","","Algebra;Content based retrieval;Database languages;IEC standards;ISO;Indexing;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Multimedia databases;XML","Web services;multimedia databases;query languages","MPEG-7 query framework;XML;expression language;extensible Web services-based binding;input query structure;multimedia content description;multimedia databases;multimedia repositories;multimedia retrieval services;multimedia search;output response format;query language;relational-like algebra;service interface","","4","","12","","","28-30 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With prosperity of the Internet, information access technologies have become one of the very fundamental social infrastructures and its importance has been increased tremendously. Research and development of information access technologies require solid evidence based on experiments to show the superiority of the newly proposed system and/or strategy over previous ones. NTCIR has provided large-scale infrastructures usable for such testing and evaluation. Conducting meaningful and reliable large-scale evaluation is not easy - The success criteria for information access are human judgments of ""relevance"", which are not consistent across assessors and over time. Difficulty of the information access varies according to the document sets, users' search requests, and users' tasks or situation. Under such circumstances, how to perform more reliable, stable and sensible evaluation are always challenging. We have cumulated insights on these matters working together with participants and other evaluation projects of the world like TREC, CLEF and DUC. We hope that the NTCIR Workshops serve for those areas and that wide-ranging insights have been produced as results To conclude, some thoughts on future directions are suggested.","","POD:0-7695-2983-6","10.1109/CIT.2007.189","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4385048","","Humans;Informatics;Information retrieval;Information technology;Internet;Large-scale systems;Research and development;Solids;Testing;Text mining","Internet;information retrieval","Internet;NII Test Collection;cross-lingual efforts;information access;information retrieval;large-scale evaluation infrastructure;large-scale evaluations;large-scale infrastructures;question answering;reliable large-scale evaluation;social infrastructures;text mining;text summarization","","0","","","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Granular computing (GrC) is a pragmatic approach to data and knowledge engineering. Roughly, it is a methodology that involves elements (data) and subsets (knowledge). We will illustrate the idea via a web application. In traditional web processing, we often represent a document by a set of keywords. In GrC, let us call it granular representation, we include the knowledge. More precisely, a document is not only represented by its keywords, but also by its granules. Here by a granule we mean a keyword association, which is a set of frequent co-occurring near by keywords. For a trivial example, the association, ""Wall street,"" as a financial concept, is in the granular representation. The granular representation has an interesting geometric interpretation. We can regard the set of keywords as a set of vertices, and the set of keyword associations as a set of simplexes. Interestingly in such a translation, the a priori principle is converted into the closed condition of simplical complexes. In other words, the collection of keywords and keyword associations is an abstract simplicial complex in algebraic topology.","","POD:0-7695-3032-X","10.1109/GrC.2007.159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4403055","","Chapters;Computer Society;Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Data warehouses;Information retrieval;Knowledge engineering;Silicon;Topology","Internet;combinatorial mathematics;document handling","Web processing;algebraic topology;document representation;geometric interpretation;granular computing;keyword association;knowledge engineering;simplicial complex","","0","","","","","2-4 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Semantic content-based video retrieval system is a software system that uses a semantic index built over a collection of video documents to retrieve the sequences of video frames that satisfy the given conditions. This work introduces a new multilevel view of data for the semantic content-based video retrieval systems. At the topmost level, we define an abstract view of data and we express it in a notation of enhanced conceptual modeling suitable for the formal representation of the semantic contents of video documents. A semistructured data model is proposed for the middle level representation of data. At the bottom level we implement a semistructured data model as an object-relational database. The completeness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through the mappings of a conceptual level into a semistructured level and into an object-relational organization of data.

However, there are different sensor platforms, usually not compatible among them and, under specific conditions, considering the advantages of each one, it might be sensible using more than one of them within the same application. This paper describes the design and implementation of a framework for WSN (WSN adaptation framework, WAF), which offers a generic API able to manage subjacent heterogeneous sensor platforms, thus allowing a homogenous usage of their functionalities, especially from the service developer perspective, who does not longer need to worry about the primitives specific to the different platforms.

In order to generate such trees, the method separates object regions from background by detecting figures defining boundary between object regions and background. The proposed method finds object regions before rasterizing, which is an essential difference from existing object separation methods.

FOCS '07. 48th Annual IEEE Symposium on","20071127","2007","","","227","237","We introduce a new primitive called intrusion-resilient secret sharing (IRSS), whose security proof exploits the fact that there exist functions which can be efficiently computed interactively using low communication complexity in k, but not in k-1 rounds. IRSS is a means of sharing a secret message amongst a set of players which comes with a very strong security guarantee. The shares in an IRSS are made artificially large so that it is hard to retrieve them completely, and the reconstruction procedure is interactive requiring the players to exchange k short messages. The adversaries considered can attack the scheme in rounds, where in each round the adversary chooses some player to corrupt and some function, and retrieves the output of that function applied to the share of the corrupted player. This model captures for example computers connected to a network which can occasionally he infected by malicious software like viruses, which can compute any function on the infected machine, but cannot sent out a huge amount of data. Using methods from the bounded-retrieval model, we construct an IRSS scheme which is secure against any computationally unbounded adversary as long as the total amount of information retrieved by the adversary is somewhat less than the length of the shares, and the adversary makes at most k-1 corruption rounds (as described above, where k rounds are necessary for reconstruction). We extend our basic scheme in several ways in order to allow the shares sent by the dealer to be short (the players then blow them up locally) and to handle even stronger adversaries who can learn some of the shares completely. As mentioned, there is an obvious connection between IRSS schemes and the fact that there exist functions with an exponential gap in their communication complexity for k and k-1 rounds. Our scheme implies such a separation which is in several aspects stronger than the previously known ones.","0272-5428;02725428","POD:0-7695-3010-9","10.1109/FOCS.2007.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4389495","","Art;Complexity theory;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computer viruses;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Information retrieval;Information security","computational complexity;game theory;information retrieval;interactive systems;invasive software;security of data","bounded-retrieval model;communication complexity;intrusion-resilient secret sharing;malicious software;reconstruction procedure","","11","","26","","","21-23 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our work specifically focuses on the services industry, where much of the revenue comes from the assignment of highly professional workers. Here, non-accurate matches may result in significant monetary losses and other negative effects. We deal with very large pools of both positions and employees, where optimal decisions should be made rapidly in a dynamic environment. Since traditional Operations Research (OR) methods fail to answer this problem, we employ Constraint Programming (CP), a subfield of Artificial Intelligence with strong algorithmic foundations. Our CP model builds on new constraint propagators designed for this problem (but applicable elsewhere), as well as on information retrieval methods used for analyzing the complex text describing high-end professionals and positions. Optimatch, which is based on this technology and is being used by IBM services organizations, provides strong experimental results.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1118-4; POD:978-1-4244-1117-7","10.1109/SOLI.2007.4383953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383953","","Artificial intelligence;Companies;Face;Humans;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Job shop scheduling;Operations research;Organizational aspects;Programming profession","","","","2","2","14","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A completely data-driven approach, based on trial-by-trial coupling of concurrent EEG and fMRI, was used for the retrieval of cerebral networks linked to P300. An ICA-based analysis of fMRI BOLD data allowed to characterize neuro-anatomically defined patterns, each of them with a definite spatial map and a specific time-course of activation. In addition, we performed single-trial analysis on EEG data, reconstructing the temporal evolution of the P300 amplitude. This time-course, convolved with a canonical HRF, was considered as an estimate of the P300-related activity in the BOLD signals, and allowed to identify two cerebral networks linked to target detection. They showed spatial maps already observed in previous studies, which could be respectively associated with the dorsal attention and the change-detection networks. Time-domain analysis of BOLD data suggested that the attention network might account for sustained activity reflecting amplitude modulations of P300, whereas the change-detection network for transient activity associated with the event-related P300 response.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0949-5; POD:978-1-4244-0948-8","10.1109/NFSI-ICFBI.2007.4387779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4387779","","Data analysis;Electroencephalography;Hemodynamics;Humans;Information retrieval;Object detection;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Signal processing;Time domain analysis","biomedical MRI;electroencephalography;independent component analysis;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal reconstruction;time-domain analysis;visual evoked potentials","EEG;ICA-based analysis;cerebral networks;change-detection network;electrophysiological information;fMRI;functional connectivity;hemodynamic information;human brain function;neuroanatomically defined patterns;single-trial analysis;temporal evolution reconstruction;time-domain analysis;transient activity;visual oddball task","","0","","22","","","12-14 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most effective countermeasure to resist DPA attacks is to make the power consumption of the secure IC invariant, hence uncorrelated to the input data (secret key). In hardware implementations, this can be achieved by designing the secure IC using Dynamic and Differential Logic (DDL) style. In this paper, we present a novel methodology to design DPA-resistant power invariant secure ICs using Reduced Complementary Dynamic and Differential Logic (RCDDL). The proposed methodology involves strategies to design: 1) RCDDL gates, and 2) secure circuits using RCDDL gates.

It incorporates techniques in multimedia processing, data mining, and information retrieval. By tracking vehicles' trajectories in a video and modeling semantic events, the framework initiates a progressive learning process guided by the user's relevance feedback (RF). The choice of RF is for reducing the ""semantic gap"" between the machine-readable features and the high level human concepts, which is a popular technique in the area of Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR). With the information provided by RF. a mapping between semantic video retrieval and MIL is established. Due to its robustness to high-dimensional data. One-class SVM is selected to be the core learning algorithm for MIL in this framework. Although the proposed work is intended for transportation surveillance videos, it is designed as a general framework and can be tailored to other applications as well.

Accordingly, they are not capable of characterizing both spatial and global properties of the color composition in visual scenery. In this paper, we present a perceptual color feature, which describes the global properties of the prominent colors along with a directional spatial descriptor, called as Proximity Grids. In color domain the dominant colors are extracted along with their global properties and quad-tree decomposition partitions the image so as to characterize the spatial color distribution (SCD). This approach is in accordance with the well-known Gestalt law, i.e. utilizing a top-down approach in order to model (see) the whole color composition before its parts and in this way we can avoid the problems of pixel-based approaches. The proximity grids, which cumulate the spatial co-occurrence of colors in a 2D grid, can successfully model the SCD of the prominent colors with respect to inter-color proximities and directions. Fusing both global and spatial properties forms the final descriptor, which is neither biased nor become noisy from the presence of such color elements, the so-called outliers that are not visible for humans in both spatial and color domains. Finally a penalty-trio model cumulates the differences among the color properties in a similarity distance computation during retrieval. Comparative evaluations against well-known global and spatial descriptors demonstrate the superiority of the proposed descriptor.","1845-5921;18455921","POD:978-953-184-116-0","10.1109/ISPA.2007.4383675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383675","","Content based retrieval;Distributed control;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Spatial databases;Visual databases","feature extraction;image colour analysis;visual perception","Gestalt law;color composition;color features;color perception;content based image retrieval;directional spatial color descriptor;human visual system;perceptual model;proximity grids;visual scenery","","0","","22","","","27-29 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our system uses frame-wise phoneme recognition and continuous dynamic programming (CDP). First, each target and query waveform is divided into fixed short-time frames; second, each frame of the waveform is used to estimate a phoneme label using Bayes estimation; third, the query sequences of phoneme labels are searched from target sequences by time-robustness CDP; and, finally, this system gets candidate answers. This method is robust along the time dimension, and thus has a great advantage for natural voice as well as song.

A 220 MHz SAW device was fabricated on LiNbO<sub>3</sub> substrate; composed of an interdigitated transducer (IDT), a dummy electrode, reflectors and a bio-sensitive layer. As the RF interrogation system sends a short RF pulse to the SAW device, the apparent pulse frequency of the return signal shifts due to binding of the biological target which decreases the velocity of the traveling pulse. The biosensor was functionalized by immobilizing anti-FITC on the dummy electrode, and tested against FITC and biocytin (negative control). The frequency shifted by 250 kHz with FITC, and 20 kHz with biocytin. Real-time monitoring of mass loading with deionized water and acetone on the device showed a 3 MHz shift. In addition, the effects of acetone evaporating on the sensor were observed as the device returned to the base frequency.","1930-0395;19300395","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1262-4; POD:978-1-4244-1261-7","10.1109/ICSENS.2007.4388493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4388493","","Acoustic pulses;Biosensors;Electrodes;Information retrieval;Passive RFID tags;RF signals;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Surface acoustic wave devices;Surface acoustic waves","biosensors;interdigital transducers;lithium compounds;niobium compounds;radiofrequency identification;surface acoustic waves","LiNbO<sub>3</sub>;RFID biosensor;biocytin;dummy electrode;frequency 20 kHz;frequency 220 MHz;frequency 250 kHz;frequency 3 MHz;interdigitated transducer;interrogative radio frequency signals;passive retrieval;shear horizontal SAW;shear horizontal surface acoustic wave;traveling pulse","","8","","9","","","28-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system contains the process of detecting objects in a sidescan sonar image, outlining the detected objects in a mosaic image which is formed by mosaicing several swathes of sonar images, and saving the detected objects in a geo-information data base. The automatic object detection algorithm is based on the reflection strength (highlights), shadows and their properties. Information on detected objects such as the estimated size, shape and their geo-locations are retrieved by the analysis. The localized objects and ancillary information are subsequently loaded into a Geographical Information System (GIS). This enhances the value of the information as they can then be viewed and queried in conjunction with other useful information like bathymetry, currents and seabed sediment types in an interactive map-based display over the Internet.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0138-3; POD:978-1-4244-0137-6","10.1109/OCEANSAP.2006.4393960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4393960","","Geographic Information Systems;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information systems;Object detection;Reflection;Sediments;Shape;Software systems;Sonar detection","bathymetry;geographic information systems;image segmentation;object detection;oceanographic techniques;sediments;sonar detection;sonar imaging","GIS;Geographical Information System;Internet;automatic object detection algorithm;bathymetry;geolocalization;interactive map-based display;manmade object detection;mosaic image;ocean currents;reflection strength;seabed sediment types;shadows;sidescan sonar images;sonar image mosaicing","","1","","4","","","16-19 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intension of constrained concept lattice nodes is regarded as subspace and sparsity coefficient is computed for every intension reductions of the nodes. If sparsity coefficient of k dimensional intension reduction is less than the sparsity coefficient threshold value, k-1 dimensional intensions are judged whether it is dense subspace. If all subspaces are dense, objects contained in the intension are seen as bias data or outliers in k dimensional subspace.

The approximation relation is based on the fact that the i-th autocorrelation coefficient with bit rate B<sub>1</sub> of a piece of music computed in the encoding step of TwinVQ audio compression can approximate the j-th autocorrelation coefficient with bit rate B<sub>2</sub> of the piece of music, where i = [(B<sub>1</sub>/B<sub>2</sub>) j].

For example, in environmental monitoring applications. WSN may archive sensor data for retrieval at periodic intervals. In contrast to conventional network data storage, storing data in WSNs is challenging because of the limited power, memory, and communication bandwidth of WSNs. This paper identifies the critical parameters of WSNs and proposes a cost model for data storage and retrieval. This paper also proposes a distributed algorithm that utilizes the cost model to intelligently distribute excess data from sensor nodes over WSN. The proposed algorithm chooses for remote storage nodes with the most extra memory and the least communication cost. The algorithm also adapts dynamically to changes in the storage requirements of sensor nodes. The benefits of the cost model are experimentally evaluated by using the algorithm in a simulated WSN. Results from the experiments show that as much as 30% more data may be stored in WSN at a slightly higher communication cost when a node's data is distributed across WSN instead of only being stored locally in the node.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0832-0; POD:978-1-4244-0831-3","10.1109/ICDEW.2007.4400970","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4400970","","Application software;Batteries;Costs;Distributed algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Intelligent sensors;Memory;Sensor arrays;Wireless sensor networks","data handling;wireless sensor networks","cost model;data retrieval;data storage;distributed algorithm;environmental monitoring;intelligent excess data distribution;sensor data archiving;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","3","","27","","","17-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SAFE uses the concept of balanced tree to provide users extra keywords for feedback. These keywords can guide users to have a proper feedback in further searching.

To this end, we have defined an approach to identify static pages that are duplicated or cloned at the content level. This approach is based on a process that first computes the dissimilarity between Web pages using latent semantic indexing, a well known information retrieval technique, and then groups similar pages using clustering algorithms. We consider five instances of this process, each based on three variants of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, a divisive clustering algorithm, k-means partitional clustering algorithm, and a widely employed partitional competitive clustering algorithm, namely Winner Takes All. In order to assess the proposed approach, we have used the static pages of three Web applications and one static Web site.","1550-4441;15504441","POD:978-1-4244-1450-5","10.1109/WSE.2007.4380246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4380246","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Clustering algorithms;Indexing;Information retrieval;Navigation;Partitioning algorithms;Software systems;Time to market;Web pages","Web sites;indexing;information retrieval;semantic Web","Web pages;agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm;divisive clustering algorithm;information retrieval technique;k-means partitional clustering algorithm;latent semantic indexing;partitional competitive clustering algorithm;static Web site","","6","","24","","","5-6 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Balancing Interactive Data Management of Massive Data with Situational Awareness through Smart Aggregation","D. R. Tesone; J. R.

Traditional data management and interactive retrieval approaches have often focused on solving the data overload problem at the expense of the user's SA. This paper discusses various data management strategies and the strengths and limitations of each approach in providing the user with SA. A new data management strategy, coined Smart Aggregation, is presented as a powerful approach to overcome the challenges of both massive data sets and maintaining SA. By combining automatic data aggregation with user-defined controls on what, how, and when data should be aggregated, we present a visualization system that can handle massive amounts of data while affording the user with the best possible SA. This approach ensures that a system is always usable in terms of both system resources and human perceptual resources. We have implemented our Smart Aggregation approach in a visual analytics system called VIAssist (Visual Assistant for Information Assurance Analysis) to facilitate exploration, discovery, and SA in the domain of Information Assurance.","","POD:978-1-4244-1659-2","10.1109/VAST.2007.4388998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4388998","Data management;data retrieval;information visualization;situational awareness;smart aggregation;visual analytics","Automation;Data visualization;Databases;Displays;Energy management;Human resource management;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Technology management;Visual analytics","data visualisation;interactive systems","interactive data management;massive data sets;smart data aggregation;user situational awareness;visual analytics system;visualization system","","9","","9","","","Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 1 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So there are those directions that future search engines are pursuing to, such as how to express the information requirement, how to lay out and browse the information structure, and how to build individuated and intelligent model based on information requirement etc. Therefore, intelligent search engine based on conceptual relations is the best way to answer for the need of information retrieval. In this paper we put forward an intelligent search engine which Information Retrieval model is found on formal context of FCA (formal concept analysis) and incorporates with a browsing mechanism for such a system based on the concept lattice. Test data validates its feasibility, and implement of the FCA-search engine indicates that the concept lattice of FCA is a useful way of supporting the flexible management of documents according to conceptual relation.","","POD:0-7695-3032-X","10.1109/GrC.2007.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4403184","","Competitive intelligence;Context modeling;Databases;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Intelligent structures;Lattices;Search engines;Web pages","information retrieval;search engines","Chinese information retrieval;formal concept analysis;information requirement;information retrieval model;intelligent search engine;keyword matching","","1","","14","","","2-4 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, to retrieve reasonable cloud distributions, a 1-D variational Ice Cloud Microphysics Data Assimilation System (IMDAS) is developed to improve the predictability of NWP models. The general framework of IMDAS includes the Lin ice cloud microphysics scheme as a model operator, a four-stream fast microwave radiative transfer model in the atmosphere as an observation operator, and a global minimization method that is known as the shuffled complex evolution. IMDAS assimilates the satellite microwave radiometer data set of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and retrieves integrated water vapor and integrated cloud liquid water content. This new method successfully introduces heterogeneity into the initial state of the atmosphere, and the modeled microwave brightness temperatures agree well with the observations of the Wakasa Bay Experiment 2003 in Japan. It has significantly improved the performance of the cloud microphysics scheme by the intrusion of heterogeneity into the external global reanalysis data, which resultantly improved atmospheric initial conditions.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.907740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407631","Cloud microphysics;Lin ice microphysics scheme;data assimilation;integrated cloud liquid water content (ICLWC);integrated water vapor (IWV);remote sensing","Atmospheric modeling;Clouds;Content based retrieval;Data assimilation;Ice;Information retrieval;Microwave theory and techniques;Oceans;Predictive models;Satellite broadcasting","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric precipitation;atmospheric techniques;clouds;radiative transfer;remote sensing;weather forecasting","1D variational Ice Cloud Microphysics Data Assimilation System;AD 2003;AMSR-E;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer;Earth Observing System;IMDAS;Japan;Wakasa Bay Experiment;atmospheric integrated water vapor;atmospheric precipitation prediction;atmospheric variable observation;cloud distribution;cloud microphysical process;integrated cloud liquid water content;microwave radiative transfer model;numerical weather prediction models;satellite data;satellite microwave radiometer data","","7","","62","","","Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the interest of simplicity, these lists often obscure, abstract, or omit many relevant metrics pertaining to the measured ""strength"" of the recommendations or the relationships the recommended items share with each other. This information is often useful for coming to a better understanding of the nature of how the items are structured according to the recommendation data. This paper describes the ZMDS algorithm, a novel way of analyzing the fundamental network structure of recommendation results. Furthermore, it also describes a nonlinear repulsion plot method as a utility for mapping and interacting with the results generated by the ZMDS algorithm on music recommendation data. A novel ""recommendation map"" Web application implements both the ZMDS algorithm and the repulsion plot interface and are offered as an example of both components working together.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0832-0; POD:978-1-4244-0831-3","10.1109/ICDEW.2007.4401071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4401071","","Aggregates;Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Data visualization;Entropy;Human computer interaction;Informatics;Music information retrieval;Navigation;Recommender systems","information filtering;music","ZMDS algorithm;music recommendation mapping;nonlinear repulsion plot;recommendation system;repulsion plot interface;structural network entropy","","1","","8","","","17-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
