They also benefit a lot from the development of social media, resulting in a large amount of attractions uploaded by users. To tackle this, attractions should be real time classified by user-generated photos automatically to gain better user experience. However, in practice, the given label of photos and text ratings may be incomplete or missing. Moreover, recently, domain adaptation has been applied to deal with few labeled data. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for automatically attraction classification in leveraging web-harvesting data from search engine and the photos of attractions uploaded by users. Specifically, we assume that top-k web-harvesting images from search engines have correct labels. The classification problem is formulated as a regularized domain adaptation approach. Experiments conducted on the collected real-world data set demonstrated that the promising performance is gained over state-of-the art classification methods.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2656878","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7829353","Attraction classification;domain adaptation;web source","Adaptation models;Feature extraction;Noise measurement;Search engines;Testing;Training data;Visualization","Internet;information retrieval;pattern classification;search engines;social networking (online);travel industry","Web-harvesting data;attraction classification;domain adaptation;intelligent travel guide systems;regularized domain adaptation;search engine;social media;text ratings;top-k Web-harvesting images;user experience;user-generated photos","","","","","","20170123","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the solutions that can be used to do that is a web crawler. In this paper, we develop a method to search statistical documents, specifically on finance domain using a web crawler based on link categorization. The method is a modified form of Breadth-first ordering strategy, where every link that is found will be categorized into three groups: Positive link, Negative link and Neutral link. The objective is to identify whether the link is likely pointing into relevant documents or not. In addition, we also utilize keywords related financial domain to recognize a relevant document.

How to push the news and customized content to users timely and dynamically, so as to save the searching time, becomes a hot area of current research. A news correlation approach based on tags is proposed to provide users with a personalized news service. The system takes advantage of the network information crawling, web-based text mining and personalized recommendations technologies to realize automated extraction of news tag. The innovation of this mode is that the tag contains both categories and keywords. It contains a classification subject to the advantage of clustering, but also includes the theme of keywords intuitive expression. In other words, it matches the user's search habits.

Besides, treating all the users with same authority for all topics is intuitively not ideal. In this paper, a comprehensive strategy for microblog ranking is proposed. First, we extend the conventional TF-IDF based content similarity with exploiting knowledge from WordNet. Then, we further incorporate a new feature for microblog ranking that is the topical relation between search keyword and its retrieval. Author topical authority is also incorporated into the ranking framework as an important feature for microblog ranking. Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT), then is employed to train the ranking model with multiple features involved.

The wearable device consists of a radio transceiver and an alarm actuator while the main unit consists of a processor, radio transceivers, directional antennas, and ultrasound-based distance sensors. When the main unit detects and identifies a medical staff, it populates the identified information to an online database. In case the approached patient is already infected, the wearable device worn by staff activates an alarm. To reserve the battery power of the wearable device, an RF wake-up sensor is designed. The RF module of the wearable device will gain a new feature to be a hybrid (active/passive) device with a current consumption as low as 0.5 μA at 3 V supply. Furthermore, the main unit enters a power saving mode by disconnecting power from the distance sensors until a personnel approaches an area of contamination.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0916-9; POD:978-1-5090-0917-6","10.1109/MWSCAS.2016.7870085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7870085","","DH-HEMTs;Databases;Hospitals;Radio frequency;Ultrasonic imaging;Wearable sensors","Internet;alarm systems;biomedical communication;biomedical ultrasonics;directive antennas;diseases;health care;hospitals;information retrieval systems;low-power electronics;personnel;power aware computing;radio transceivers;ultrasonic transducers;wearable computers","HAI prevention;RF wake-up sensor;active-passive device;alarm actuator;battery power;current consumption;directional antennas;frequency 40 kHz;frequency 868 MHz;hospital staff;hospital-acquired infections prevention;hybrid device;low power autonomous system;medical staff;nosocomial infection spread prevention;online database;personnel;power saving mode;radio transceiver;radiofrequency techniques;ultrasound wave techniques;ultrasound-based distance sensors;voltage 3 V;wearable device","","","","","","","16-19 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With strategic participants, the requester needs to reward the participants to introduce the incentives of participation. However, it is natural to ask whether it is worth introducing incentives if the total payment for eliciting incentives is too high. This paper addresses such a fundamental concern by designing a frugal mechanism with minimum payment used to procure the total amount of service contributions demanded. We design two mechanisms to provide the incentives of participation while minimizing the payment used by the requester. We first propose a frugal auction-based mechanism, which stimulates participants to truthfully report their information. We theoretically prove that the payment used is not more than the optimal cost (with no incentive considered) plus a bounded additive. We then design a Stackelberg-game-based mechanism, in which the requester fixes a certain total payment at the very beginning so as to encourage the participants to compete for it and participate in the task. We verify the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) and develop a novel algorithm to find the NE, as well as the optimal payment to extract the NE. Our simulation results show that the payment used in these mechanisms is close to the optimal solution with no incentive considered, while the extra payment caused by introducing truthfulness in auction-based mechanism is about twice that of the NE in Stakelberg-game-based mechanism.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2017.2659278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835200","Crowdsourcing;Nash equilibrium;Stackelberg-game;fairness;frugality;truthful mechanism design","Additives;Algorithm design and analysis;Crowdsourcing;Nash equilibrium;Procurement;Resource management;Sensors","game theory;information retrieval;mobile computing","NE;Nash equilibrium;Stackelberg-game-based mechanism;crowdsourcing markets;frugal auction-based mechanism;incentive mechanism design;participation incentives;service contributions;strategic participants","","","","","","20170126","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed work actually concentrates on RDF-ization for converting the XML Records to RDF Records, so that the entire data can be stored into a triple store database. For efficient storage, triple store uses vertical partitioning algorithm for storing data in searchable format. It converts the entire data into indexes and keywords.

Many seemingly disorganized constituents connected with different gap constraints often repetitively appear in these real-word sequences, which are considered as latent frequent patterns (FPs). A latent FP both with flexible gap and approximate constraints (replacement, deletion and insertion operations) deepen difficulty to discover its true occurrences. We design a Mining Approximate frequent PAttern (MAPA) algorithm to handle the problem: (1) We first extend an Approximate Edit Distance Matrix (A-EDM) by tackling replacement, insertion and deletion under the gap constraint to discover various deformations of patterns. (2) Then we employ an effectively back-tracking Approximate Pattern Matching (APM) scheme to obtain each candidate latent FP's support.

However, outsourced data must be encrypted in order to be protected against possible attacks. Therefore, traditional information retrieval systems (IRS) are no longer effective and must be adapted in order to work over encrypted cloud data. In addition, in order to provide the ability to search over an encrypted index, we use the vector model to represent documents and queries which is the most used in the literature. During the search process, the query vector must be compared with each document vector which is a time consuming process since the data collection is generally huge. Consequently, the search performance is degraded and the search process is too slow. To overcome this drawback, we propose the use of High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures to accelerate the search over encrypted cloud data. Indeed, we propose several techniques that take benefit from Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and computer cluster architectures by distributing the work between different threads. In addition, in order to get the best performance, we design our solutions so that they can process several queries simultaneously.

We aim to solve the answer ranking problem in practical question answering system with deep learning approaches. In this paper, we define a composite representation for questions and answers by combining convolutional neural network (CNN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) models, and learn a similarity function to relate them in a supervised way from the available training data.

Researchers are investigating summarization tools and methods that automatically extract or abstract content from a range of information sources, including multimedia. Researchers are looking at approaches which roughly fall into two categories. Knowledge-poor approaches rely on not having to add new rules for each new application domain or language. Knowledge-rich approaches assume that if you grasp the meaning of the text, you can reduce it more effectively, thus yielding a better summary. Some approaches use a hybrid. In both methods, the main constraint is the compression requirement. High reduction rates pose a challenge because they are hard to attain without a reasonable amount of background knowledge. Another challenge is how to evaluate summarizers. If you are to trust that the summary is indeed a reliable substitute for the source, you must be confident that it does in fact reflect what is relevant in that source. Hence, methods for creating and evaluating summaries must complement each other.","0018-9162;00189162","","10.1109/2.881692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=881692","","Abstracts;Data mining;Handheld computers;Information retrieval","abstracting","abstracting;automatic summarization;background knowledge;compression requirement;information sources;knowledge-poor approaches;knowledge-rich approaches;multimedia;reduction rates;summarization tools","","72","4","15","","","Nov. 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the different formats of websites, the crawling scheme for different sites can differ dramatically. Manually customizing a crawler for each specific site is time consuming and error-prone. Furthermore, because sites periodically change their format and presentation, crawling schemes have to be manually updated and adjusted. In this paper, we present a technique for automatic synthesis of web-crawlers from examples. The main idea is to use hand-crafted (possibly partial) crawlers for some websites as the basis for crawling other sites that contain the same kind of information. Technically, we use the data on one site to identify data on another site. We then use the identified data to learn the website structure and synthesize an appropriate extraction scheme. We iterate this process, as synthesized extraction schemes result in additional data to be used for re-learning the website structure. We implemented our approach and automatically synthesized 30 crawlers for websites from nine different categories: books, TVs, conferences, universities, cameras, phones, movies, songs, and hotels.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3900-1; POD:978-1-5090-2071-3","10.1145/2884781.2884842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886918","Data extraction;scarpper;synthesis;wrapper","Concrete;Containers;Crawlers;Data mining;Database languages;Glass;Layout","Internet;information retrieval","Web crawler;crawler customization;crawling schemes;cross-supervised synthesis;information extraction","","","","","","","14-22 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In RTDBSs, this problem becomes more complicated since the transaction manager must not only avoid data access conflicts, but it has also to provide mechanisms that help transactions to meet their deadlines, to maximize the transactions success ratio. In this paper, we describe The SCC protocol (Speculative Concurrency Control) which is one of the first concurrency control protocol RTDBS. It is based on the transactions duplicating transactions.

Often, the collaborative efforts from a large crowd of users are needed in order to complete crowdsourcing jobs. In recent years, the design of crowdsourcing incentive mechanisms has drawn much interest from the research community, where auction is one of the commonly adopted mechanisms. However, few of these auctions consider the robustness against false-name attacks (a.k.a. sybil attacks), where dishonest users generate fake identities to increase their utilities without devoting more efforts. To provide countermeasures against such attacks, we have designed a Truthful Auction with countermeasures against False-name Attacks (TAFA) as an auction-based incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing. We prove that TAFA is truthful, individually rational, budget-balanced, and computationally efficient. We also prove that TAFA provides countermeasures against false-name attacks, such that each user is better off not generating any false name. Extensive performance evaluations are conducted and the results further confirm our theoretical analysis.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2017.2659229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835128","Game theory;crowdsourcing;false-name proofness;incentive mechanism;truthfulness","Collaboration;Computational modeling;Crowdsourcing;Electronic mail;Environmental monitoring;Mechanical factors;Robustness","information retrieval;mobile computing;security of data","TAFA mechanism;crowdsourcing incentive mechanisms;false-name attacks;truthful auction with countermeasures against false-name attacks;truthful incentive mechanism","","","","","","20170126","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a framework named Similarity based Automatic Web Search Engine Evaluation, SAWSEE, to evaluate web search engines. SAWSEE measures the information retrieval effectiveness of web search engines by comparing and voting their returned results, particularly using nDCG metric to rank search engines. SAWSEE compares the search engines' results based on their similarity which is calculated in two consecutive levels, the web page address level and the main content of web page level. To find the similarity of the main content of two search engines' results, SAWSEE utilizes Winnowing algorithm, a well-known and widely-used plagiarism detection method. We compared our method with the results acquired from human assessors' evaluations. The promising comparison shows that SAWSEE provides rankings that are consistent with the rankings resulted from human assessors' evaluations. Hence, the proposed method can be applied in real world environments for evaluation of web search engines.","","CD:978-1-5090-3434-5; Electronic:978-1-5090-3435-2; POD:978-1-5090-3436-9","10.1109/ISTEL.2016.7881901","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881901","Web Quality Assessment;Web Retrieval & Content Analysis","Engines;Google;Navigation;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Web pages;Web search","Internet;information retrieval;search engines","SAWSEE;Web page address level;Winnowing algorithm;information retrieval;nDCG metric;plagiarism detection method;similarity based automatic Web search engine evaluation","","","","","","","27-28 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The information gain ratio and similarity respectively replaced the initial probability and state transition probability of hidden Markov chain model. Secondly, this paper combines conventional hidden Markov chain to analyze information attributes and gets more strongly related with the target attribute properties at the same time, finally we make a recommendation.

The problem of event detection based on social media has attracted researchers' attention recently because of the enormous popularity of social media. Existing approaches focus on features that don't reflect full characteristics of the social network. For the purpose of this research, we define an event as an occurrence that has enough force and momentum that could create an observable change of the context of a social network. Such a definition provides us with a wider perspective through which we can view the big picture of the social network. In this research, we propose a novel framework for detecting events on social media. We introduce a temporal approach to detect structural change of the social network that reflects an occurrence of an event using machine learning algorithms. In this study, we show that processing temporal social networks captures the complete complexity of the social network, which results in a higher accuracy of event detection.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4228-9; POD:978-1-5090-4229-6","10.1109/CCWC.2017.7868467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868467","Big data;Event detection;Machine learning;Social media analysis;data mining","Clustering algorithms;Event detection;Feature extraction;Media;Shape;Twitter","Big Data;data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","Big data;event detection;machine learning;news channels;social media networks;temporal analysis;temporal social network processing","","","","","","","9-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous studies have shown that the performance of network-coding-assisted data broadcast systems is highly related to client cache contents. In this paper, we investigate the cache management problem in network-coding-assisted data broadcast environments with the objective of minimizing the overall response time. We formulate the problem and prove that it is NP-hard. Furthermore, we derive a probabilistic model to analyze the decoding probability to give insight into the importance of the cache management scheme. On this basis, we propose a decoding-oriented cache management scheme, which is called decoding-oriented least recently used (DLRU), which incorporates decoding information in making cache replacement decisions. In addition, since individual clients may observe the global data access pattern from encoded packets broadcast by the server, we loosen the cache admission control policy and allow clients to cache decodable and potentially useful data items that are not currently being requested. Based on this idea, we further propose a variant scheme, which is called DLRU with cache partitioning (DLRU-CP), which couples the cache partitioning policy to DLRU. We build a simulation model and implement the most competing alternative solutions in the literature for performance evaluation. The simulation results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes in terms of reducing the request response time in network-coding-assisted data broadcast systems.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2016.2589460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7508392","Cache management;mobile computing;network coding;on-demand broadcast","Bandwidth;Decoding;Encoding;Network coding;Scheduling algorithms;Servers;Time factors","broadcast communication;cache storage;computational complexity;decoding;information retrieval;mobile computing;network coding;optimisation;probability;telecommunication control","DLRU-CP;NP-hard problem;cache admission control policy;cache partitioning;cache replacement decisions;client cache contents;data broadcast systems;decoding information;decoding probability;decoding-oriented cache management scheme;decoding-oriented least recently used;global data access pattern;network-coding;probabilistic model;request response time","","","","","","20160709","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using recent techniques, equipped devices can leverage energy-saving modes to reduce the amount of energy consumed by wireless communication hardware. However, the use of parallel channels leads to challenges accessing concurrently broadcast data items and switching between channels both of which can incur additional energy costs and increase response time. To reduce these costs, the retrieval of data items can be scheduled in an order that reduces the required number of channel switches and repeated passes over a broadcast. Existing scheduling techniques, including Parallel Object Scan (POS) and Serial Empty Scan (SES) are able to produce optimal schedules through a broadcast on parallel channels. The energy consumed by the generated schedules has been studied previously. In this paper, we investigate the energy consumed by the execution of the POS and SES scheduling algorithms. The algorithms were executed in an emulated Android environment, where instrumentation tools were used to monitor the instructions executed by the virtualized CPU.

In order to track the spreading of events on Twitter, First Story Detection (FSD), an interesting task to find first stories about events from a continuous twitter stream, appeared and is gaining increasing amount of significance. It is also a key step of New Event Detection (NED). Traditional methods of FSD regarded all the data (outdated historical tweets or latest arrival ones) equally in the time axis, which may lead to low efficiency and unsatisfying performance. Based on the temporal locality, where most events lasts only 3 or 4 days (first reach a peak in 1 or 2 days and then fall down), we propose a time-aware algorithm for FSD, which incorporates the time and trend factors to sort the events, and only truncate the top-K as candidates for a newly come tweet that ought to be classified into one of them or a first story of a new event. Experiments on three authoritative datasets show that our method is superior to the current state-of-art method in both effect and efficiency.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1192-6; POD:978-1-5090-1193-3","10.1109/DSC.2016.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7866195","Event detection;SinglePass;Twitter","Clustering algorithms;Electronic mail;Event detection;Feature extraction;Market research;Twitter","information retrieval;social networking (online)","FSD;NED;Twitter stream;history information;new event detection;social network;temporal locality;time-aware algorithm;time-aware first story detection","","","","","","","13-16 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Knowledge Graphs represent a major advancement in the construction of the Web of Data where machines are context-aware when answering users' queries. The English Knowledge Graph was a milestone realized by Google in 2012. Even though it is a useful source of information for English users and applications, it does not offer much for the Arabic users and applications. In this paper, we investigated the different challenges and opportunities prone to the life-cycle of the construction of the Arabic Knowledge Graph (AKG) while following some best practices and techniques. Additionally, this work suggests some potential solutions to these challenges. The proprietary factor of data creates a major problem in the way of harvesting this latter. Moreover, when the Arabic data is openly available, it is generally in an unstructured form which requires further processing. The complexity of the Arabic language itself creates a further problem for any automatic or semi-automatic extraction processes. Therefore, the usage of NLP techniques is a feasible solution. Some preliminary results are presented later in this paper. The AKG has very promising outcomes for the Semantic Web in general and the Arabic community in particular. The goal of the Arabic Knowledge Graph is mainly the integration of the different isolated datasets available on the Web. Later, it can be used in both the academic (by providing a large dataset for many different research fields and enhance discovery) and commercial sectors (by improving search engines, providing metadata, interlinking businesses).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4284-5; POD:978-1-5090-4285-2","10.1109/ICSC.2017.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889502","Arabic Knowledge Graph;Challenges;Linked Data;Opportunities;Semantic Web","Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Feature extraction;Internet;Ontologies;Semantics","graph theory;natural language processing;question answering (information retrieval);semantic Web","AKG;Arabic knowledge graph;NLP;natural language processing;query answering;semantic Web","","","","","","","Jan. 30 2017-Feb. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In mobile application services, the processing and representation of data is a key issue which has a great impact on the service quality. Knowledge map is regarded as an effective method and has been widely utilized in mobile devices. However, traditional knowledge maps employed in mobile devices are subject to a lack of cognition characteristics, which results in corresponding information services' being unable to match the users' cognition level, thus affecting the quality of services. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical cognitive academic map (HCAM) for the specific academic domain application background. HCAM can meet the needs of three basic levels of Bloom's cognition taxonomy model by distinguishing the academic attributes of nodes and relations between nodes. First, academic concepts are the basic units in HCAM and are classified into research object concepts and method/technique concepts, which meet the human's remembering cognition levels. Second, HCAM provides the implementation and collaboration relation between concepts, which satisfies the human's applying and understanding cognition levels. Third, technique/method concepts are organized in the form of hierarchical structure from the top down of which concepts' specificity for the domain get higher and higher. In addition, Bayesian rose tree clustering is adopted in the construction of this hierarchical structure and acquiring the cognition depth for each concept. Furthermore, experiments on information retrieval field and data mining field are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and cognition characteristics of HCAM.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2657790","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7833131","Bayesian Rose Tree;Knowledge representation;clustering algorithms;cognition;entropy","Cognition;Collaboration;Data mining;Information services;Knowledge engineering;Mobile applications;Mobile handsets","cognition;data mining;educational administrative data processing;information retrieval;pattern clustering","Bayesian rose tree clustering;Bloom cognition taxonomy model;HCAM;cognition characteristics;cognition depth;cognition levels;data mining;hierarchical cognitive academic map construction;hierarchical structure;information retrieval;specific academic domain application background","","","","","","20170125","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To address this issue, we develop a mobile trajectory retrieval system named TREST, which is based on the distributed Hadoop and HBase systems. TREST makes use of the horizontal expansion mechanism of Hadoop to store overwhelming spatio-temporal trajectories, and supports frequent incremental insertion of data stream. Meanwhile, TREST maps the spatio-temporal features of trajectories into the simple key-value schema of HBase to support fast retrieval. We also develop a prototype of TREST to manipulate the real mobile trajectory data set, which contains totally 104 million records collected by mobile service providers. Experiments on this data set show that TREST can efficiently support both Single-track and All-track retrieval within milliseconds on average.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1192-6; POD:978-1-5090-1193-3","10.1109/DSC.2016.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7866148","Hadoop;Mobile;Retrieval;Trajectory","Base stations;Electronic mail;Indexes;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets;Trajectory","Big Data;information retrieval;mobile computing;parallel processing","HBase system;TREST;big-data feature;data stream;distributed Hadoop system;distributed mobile trajectory retrieval system;horizontal expansion mechanism;location-based services;mobile phones;spatio-temporal data;spatio-temporal trajectories","","","","","","","13-16 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Identification of extend relations is conducted by classifying each sentence in scientific papers into extend category. Extend relation is one type of papers' relations that obtained by using the citation context based approach. Citation context is a set of words or phrases in a sentence collection that citing or discussing other papers. Citation context based approach use the semantic of citation sentence to identify the relationship between scientific papers and can identify more varied relationship than two other approaches i.e. content-based and citation analysis. The recently research in papers' relations used a rule-based approach to identify extend relations. In this paper, supervised learning approached with proposed features set was used to identify extend relations. The learning of classifier model is explored by using Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Ibk and Logistic Regression. Experimental results show that the performance of extend sentence classification based on supervised machine learning with proposed features is superior compared to the baseline. Feature selection based on correlation value is also effective to improve the performance of the extend sentence classification.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4629-4; POD:978-1-5090-4630-0; USB:978-1-5090-4628-7","10.1109/ICACSIS.2016.7872724","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872724","Citation Context;Extend;Feature;Relations;Rule-based;Supervised machine Learning","Context;Data models;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Supervised learning;Text categorization;Training","Bayes methods;citation analysis;classification;content-based retrieval;decision trees;feature extraction;feature selection;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","Naïve Bayes;citation context based approach;citation sentence;classifier model learning;correlation value;decision tree;extend relation identification;feature extraction;feature selection;ibk;logistic regression;papers relations;rule-based approach;scientific papers;sentence classification;sentence collection;supervised machine learning","","","","","","","15-16 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, different steps of producing SNPPhenA corpus were explained. They include gathering the abstracts, automatic and manual SNP and phenotype name tagging and annotating their associations. Additionally, the corpus includes negation scope and cues as well as neutral candidates that have important role in the relation extraction tasks. The inter-annotator agreement score for the confidence level which have been annotated by two annotators was between 0.70 and 0.85 that exhibit the reliability of the corpus.

However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in Cloud Computing a formidable task. Thus, enabling public auditability for cloud storage so that users can resort to a third party auditor (TPA) to check the integrity of outsourced data.

It is difficult to retrieve the desired information from noise corrupted speech signals. Bangla speech is frequently corrupted by white and colored noise in chaotic environment and so noise suppression is extremely necessary for smooth communication purpose. Background noise in Bangla speech may be stationary or dynamic in nature. Kalman filter is a well-known recursive filter that enhances speech signals corrupted by both static and dynamic noises. In this paper, we apply adaptive Kalman filter and show that it effectively reduces white and colored noise from corrupted Bangla speech and retrieves the information carried by the original speech. We compare the retrieved speech to the corresponding noise-free speech in terms of pitch values and analyze error to evaluate performance of the proposed filter. We take oral speech as voice record by native Bangla speakers and work with both vowels and consonants to show the feasibility of Kalman filter in both cases. Both male and female voices are analyzed to prove the effectiveness of the filter for Bangla speech irrespective of gender. Elimination of noise would provide non-disruptive communication in Bangla enhancing the efficacy of Bangla speech processing.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2906-8; POD:978-1-5090-2907-5","10.1109/CEEICT.2016.7873174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7873174","Bangla Speech;Colored Noise;Kalman Filter;Pitch;White Noise","Cepstrum;Colored noise;Kalman filters;Noise measurement;Speech;Speech processing;White noise","Kalman filters;adaptive filters;information retrieval;recursive filters;signal denoising;speech enhancement;white noise","Bangla speech;Bangla speech processing;adaptive Kalman filter approach;background noise;chaotic environment;colored noise suppression;dynamic noises;information retrieval;native Bangla speakers;noise-free speech;recursive filter;speech signal enhancement;static noise;white noise suppression","","","","","","","22-24 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hauptmann","University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia","IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","20170413","2017","47","5","1180","1197","Multimedia event detection has been one of the major endeavors in video event analysis. A variety of approaches have been proposed recently to tackle this problem. Among others, using semantic representation has been accredited for its promising performance and desirable ability for human-understandable reasoning. To generate semantic representation, we usually utilize several external image/video archives and apply the concept detectors trained on them to the event videos. Due to the intrinsic difference of these archives, the resulted representation is presumable to have different predicting capabilities for a certain event. Notwithstanding, not much work is available for assessing the efficacy of semantic representation from the source-level. On the other hand, it is plausible to perceive that some concepts are noisy for detecting a specific event. Motivated by these two shortcomings, we propose a bi-level semantic representation analyzing method. Regarding source-level, our method learns weights of semantic representation attained from different multimedia archives. Meanwhile, it restrains the negative influence of noisy or irrelevant concepts in the overall concept-level. In addition, we particularly focus on efficient multimedia event detection with few positive examples, which is highly appreciated in the real-world scenario. We perform extensive experiments on the challenging TRECVID MED 2013 and 2014 datasets with encouraging results that validate the efficacy of our proposed approach.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2016.2539546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442559","Bi-level;concept-level;multimedia event detection (MED);semantic representation;source-level","Detectors;Event detection;Multimedia communication;Noise measurement;Semantics;Streaming media;Training","image representation;inference mechanisms;information retrieval systems;multimedia systems;video signal processing","bilevel semantic representation;human-understandable reasoning;image/video archives;multimedia event detection;video event analysis","","2","","","","20160328","May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Synthetically recognizing and integrating these distributed and heterogeneous data for efficiently information searching is an important but challenging work. In this paper, a dynamic weight (DW)-based similarity calculation is proposed to recognize and integrate similar individuals from distributed data environments. First, each link of an individual is weighted by applying DW. Then, a semantic similarity metric is proposed to combine the DW into similarity calculation. Then, a searching system framework for a similarity-based individual is designed and tested in real-world data sets.

In this paper, we conduct a case study with 399 Android apps, to investigate whether developers respect license terms when reusing code from Stack Overflow posts (and the other way around). We found 232 code snippets in 62 Android apps from our dataset that were potentially reused from Stack Overflow, and 1,226 Stack Overflow posts containing code examples that are clones of code released in 68 Android apps, suggesting that developers may have copied the code of these apps to answer Stack Overflow questions. We investigated the licenses of these pieces of code and observed 1,279 cases of potential license violations (related to code posting to Stack overflow or code reuse from Stack overflow).

A key prerequisite for engaging the public is the ability to gather what we know about a public issue and present such knowledge in a concise fashion. This is commonly done through a citizen's panel who performs collaborative information seeking and analysis. The outcome of such process is to inform other local citizens to form perspectives and opinions. This work focuses on understanding collaborative information seeking behaviors in this process, and design of awareness support to collaboration. Specifically, we describe an ethnographic study that observes community practices and identifies requirements for supporting awareness in collaborative information seeking.

To achieve this goal they must closely monitor and analyze the user feedback they receive in form of reviews. However, successful apps can receive up to several thousands of reviews per day, manually analysing each of them is a time consuming task. To help developers deal with the large amount of available data, we manually analyzed the text of 1566 user reviews and defined a high and low level taxonomy containing mobile specific categories (e.g. performance, resources, battery, memory, etc.) highly relevant for developers during the planning of maintenance and evolution activities. Then we built the User Request Referencer (URR) prototype, using Machine Learning and Information Retrieval techniques, to automatically classify reviews according to our taxonomy and recommend for a particular review what are the source code files that need to be modified to handle the issue described in the user review. We evaluated our approach through an empirical study involving the reviews and code of 39 mobile applications. Our results show a high precision and recall of URR in organising reviews according to the defined taxonomy.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5501-2; POD:978-1-5090-5502-9","10.1109/SANER.2017.7884612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7884612","Code Localization;Mobile Applications;Text Classification;User Reviews","Batteries;Computer bugs;Maintenance engineering;Mobile applications;Mobile communication;Prototypes;Taxonomy","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;program debugging;software development management;software maintenance;source code (software)","URR;bug fixing;evolution activities;information retrieval techniques;machine learning;maintenance activities;mobile applications industry;mobile specific categories;release planning;source code files;user feedback;user request referencer prototype","","","","","","","20-24 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This may happen, for example, when introducing a design pattern in a legacy system: similar classes have to be introduced, containing similar methods that are called in a similar way. Automation of these sequences of transformations has been proposed in the literature to avoid errors due to their repetitive nature. However, developers still need support to identify all the relevant code locations that are candidate for transformation. Past research showed that these kinds of transformation can lag for years with forgotten instances popping out from time to time as other evolutions bring them into light. In this paper, we evaluate three distinct code search approaches (“structural”, based on Information Retrieval, and AST based algorithm) to find code locations that would require similar transformations. We validate the resulting candidate locations from these approaches on real cases identified previously in literature. The results show that looking for code with similar roles, e.g., classes in the same hierarchy, provides interesting results with an average recall of 87% and in some cases the precision up to 70%.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5501-2; POD:978-1-5090-5502-9","10.1109/SANER.2017.7884618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7884618","","Color;Computer bugs;History;Java;Syntactics;Systematics;Vocabulary","information retrieval;recommender systems;software maintenance;source code (software)","code locations;code transformations;design pattern;distinct code search approaches;legacy system;source code locations recommendation;system specific transformations","","","","","","","20-24 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many scenarios that may benefit from the knowledge within Term Hierarchies. Particularly, in the patents genre there is an important demand of knowledge representation for Information Retrieval purposes, and few works have approached this demand. In this work we proposed a three stage strategy for term hierarchy building from patents. In the first stage, terms were extracted through non-phrase identification; in the second stage terms were organized hierarchically through n-gram decomposition; finally, in the third stage, the term hierarchy was enriched with term embeddings information, particularly from Word2Vec model. This strategy was applied over patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) collection. Each term in the hierarchy generated a set of associated patents. For the evaluation task we applied two strategies over the sets of associated documents, one based on the clustering degree of the sets, and the other one based on the IPC (International Patent Classification) categories proportions within the sets. Results show tbat the produced term hierarchy efficiently captures generic and specific concepts.","","Electronic:978-952-68397-8-3; POD:978-1-5090-4954-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7891857","","","information retrieval;natural language processing;patents;pattern clustering","IPC;International Patent Classification;USPTO;United States Patent and Trademark Office;Word2Vec model;clustering;n-gram decomposition;nonphrase identification;patent datasets;term extraction;term hierarchy building","","","","","","","10-12 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing paradigm of mobile multimedia sharing has yet to effectively address the energy and bandwidth limitations of wireless devices. Content-Centric Networking (CCN) has been proposed as a possible way to drive the current host-centric Internet paradigm towards a novel content-centric behavior. CCN still has some limitations in providing high-quality content, highly-reliable, faster, and efficient content sharing from multiple content sources, and no existing solution is available to retrieve contents over multiple paths. In this paper, we propose a content delivery and retrieval mechanism using multipath forwarding on top of CCN where contents are divided into multiple chunks and published from multiple mobile sources. It provides a new approach to allow multiple sources for content and to retrieve them chunk by chunk in parallel. We also present an implementation of our mechanism's basic operations and demonstrate the feasibility and performance of content retrieval from multiple content sources.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5124-3; POD:978-1-5090-5125-0","10.1109/ICOIN.2017.7899448","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7899448","Content-centric networking;multipath;wireless mobile networks","Bandwidth;Mathematical model;Measurement;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Time factors;Wireless communication","Internet;information retrieval;mobile computing;multimedia communication;radio networks","CCN;content centric networking;content delivery mechanism;content retrieval mechanism;mobile multimedia sharing;multipath forwarding;multipath transport mechanism;multiple mobile source;multisource transport mechanism;wireless mobile networks","","","","","","","11-13 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
