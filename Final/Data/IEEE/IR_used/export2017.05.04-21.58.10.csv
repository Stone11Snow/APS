"Towards Indian language spell-checker design","B. B. Chaudhuri","Comput. Vision & Pattern Recognition Unit, Indian Stat. Inst., Calcutta, India","Language Engineering Conference, 2002. Proceedings","20030228","2002","","","139","146","This paper deals with the development of a spell-checker in Indian languages using as an example Bangla, the second most popular language on the Indian Subcontinent. A brief review of problems and the current scenario of Indian language spell-checkers is described. The approach for the Bangla spell-checker is then elaborated. In this approach the technique works in two stages. The first stage takes care of phonetic similarity error. For that the phonetically similar characters are mapped into single units of character code. A new dictionary D<sub>c</sub> is constructed with this reduced set of alphabets. A phonetically similar but wrongly spelt word can be easily corrected using this dictionary. The second stage takes care of errors other than phonetic similarity. A wrongly spelt word S of n characters is searched in the dictionary D<sub>c</sub>. If S is a nonword, its first k<sub>1</sub>â‰¤n characters will match with a valid word in D<sub>c</sub>. (if k<sub>1</sub>=n then the word in D<sub>c</sub> must be longer than n). A reversed word dictionary D<sub>r</sub> is also generated where the characters of the word are maintained in a reversed order. If the last k<sub>2</sub> characters of S match with a word in D<sub>r</sub> then, for a single error, it is located within the intersection region of first k<sub>1</sub>+1 and last k<sub>2</sub>+1 characters of S. We observed that this region is very small compared to word length for most cases and the number of suggested correct words can be drastically reduced using this information. We have used our approach in correcting Bangla text, where the problem of inflection is tackled by a simplified version of a morphological analyser. Another problem encountered in Indian languages is the existence of a large number of compound words formed by euphony and assimilation. The problem of compound words is also carefully tackled.","","POD:0-7695-1885-0","10.1109/LEC.2002.1182301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1182301","","Computer errors;Computer interfaces;Computer vision;Dictionaries;Error correction;Information retrieval;Optical character recognition software;Optical computing;Pattern recognition;Speech recognition","computational linguistics;dictionaries;mathematical morphology;natural languages;spelling aids","Bangla;Indian language spell-checker design;alphabet;assimilation;character code;compound words;dictionary;euphony;inflection;intersection region;morphological analyser;phonetic similarity error;phonetically similar characters;reversed word dictionary","","1","","15","","","13-15 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Contrary to the single feature vector approach which tries to classify the query and retrieve similar images in one step, CQA uses multiple feature sets and a two-step approach to retrieval. The first step classifies the query according to the class labels of the images using the features that best discriminate the classes. The second step then retrieves the most similar images within the predicted class using the features customized to distinguish ""subclasses"" within that class. Needing to find the customized feature subset for each class led us to investigate feature selection for unsupervised learning. As a result, we developed a new algorithm called FSSEM (feature subset selection using expectation-maximization clustering). We applied our approach to a database of high resolution computed tomography lung images and show that CQA radically improves the retrieval precision over the single feature vector approach. To determine whether our CBIR system is helpful to physicians, we conducted an evaluation trial with eight radiologists. The results show that our system using CQA retrieval doubled the doctors' diagnostic accuracy.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1182100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1182100","","Clustering algorithms;Computed tomography;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image resolution;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Lungs;Spatial databases;Unsupervised learning","computer vision;content-based retrieval;image retrieval;medical image processing;unsupervised learning","content-based retrieval;customized feature subset;expectation-maximization clustering;feature subset selection;hierarchical approach;lung images;unsupervised feature selection;unsupervised learning","","114","7","36","","","March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most previous approaches tried to cluster data by means of spectral techniques or traditional hierarchical algorithms. The main problem with these techniques is that they ignore the fact that Web communities are social networks with distinctive statistical properties. We analyze Web communities on the basis of the evolution of an initial set of hubs and authoritative pages. The evolution law captures the behaviour of page authors with respect to the popularity of existing pages for topics of interest. Assuming such a model, we have found interesting properties of Web communities and have proposed a technique for computing relevant properties for specific topics.

We propose a new, hierarchical representation that includes browser screen coordinates for every HTML object in a page.

Proceedings.","20030225","2002","","","122","127","Technology in the field of digital media generates huge amounts of non-textual information, audio, video, and images, along with more familiar textual information. The potential for exchange and retrieval of information is vast and daunting. The key problem in achieving efficient and user-friendly retrieval is the development of a search mechanism to guarantee delivery of minimal irrelevant information (high precision) while ensuring relevant information is not overlooked (high recall). The traditional solution employs keyword-based search. The only documents retrieved are those containing user specified keywords. But many documents convey desired semantic information without containing these keywords. One can overcome this problem by indexing documents according to meanings rather than words, although this will entail a way of converting words to meanings and the creation of ontology. We have solved the problem of an index structure through the design and implementation of a concept-based model using domain-dependent ontology. Ontology is a collection of concepts and their interrelationships, which provide an abstract view of an application domain. We propose a new mechanism that can generate ontology automatically in order to make our approach scalable. For this we modify the existing self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) that constructs a hierarchy from top to bottom. Furthermore, in order to find an appropriate concept for each node in the hierarchy we propose an automatic concept selection algorithm from WordNet called linguistic ontology. To illustrate the effectiveness of our automatic ontology construction method, we have explored our ontology construction in text documents. The Reuters21578 text document corpus has been used. We have observed that our modified SOTA outperforms hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).","1082-3409;10823409","POD:0-7695-1849-4","10.1109/TAI.2002.1180796","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180796","","Artificial intelligence;Bandwidth;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Sun","information retrieval;knowledge representation;vocabulary","Reuters21578 text document corpus;WordNet;audio;automatic concept selection algorithm;concept-based model;digital media;document indexing;domain-dependent ontology construction;hierarchical agglomerative clustering;images;index structure;information exchange;information retrieval;information selection;keyword-based search;linguistic ontology;nontextual information;search mechanism;self-organizing tree algorithm;semantic information;textual information;video","","27","8","19","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We report on our work in building a system, called WebQA, that provides a declarative query-based approach to Web data retrieval that uses question-answering technology in extracting information from Web sites that are retrieved by search engines. The approach consists of first using meta-search techniques in an open environment to gather candidate responses from search engines and other on-line databases, then using information extraction techniques to find the answer to a specific question from these candidates. A prototype system has been developed to test this approach. Testing includes evaluation of its performance as a question-answering system using a well-known evaluation system called TREC-9. Its accuracy using TREC-9 data for simple questions is high and its retrieval performance is good. The system employs an open system architecture allowing for on-going improvements.","","POD:0-7695-1766-8","10.1109/WISE.2002.1181651","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181651","","Computer science;Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Metasearch;Open systems;Prototypes;Search engines;System testing;Uniform resource locators","Web sites;information retrieval;search engines","TREC-9;URLs;Web data querying;Web data retrieval;Web sites;WebQA Approach;browsing;candidate responses;declarative querying;information extraction techniques;information retrieval;information searching;keyword-based search;meta-search techniques;on-line databases;open environment;question-answering technology;search engines","","2","3","18","","","12-14 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20030310","2002","","","290","297","Clustering large data sets of high dimensionality has always been a challenge for clustering algorithms. Many recently developed clustering algorithms have attempted to address either handling data sets with a very large number of records and/or with a very high number of dimensions. We provide a discussion of the advantages and limitations of existing algorithms when they operate on very large multidimensional data sets. To simultaneously overcome both the ""curse of dimensionality"" and the scalability problems associated with large amounts of data, we propose a new clustering algorithm called O-Cluster. O-Cluster combines a novel active sampling technique with an axis-parallel partitioning strategy to identify continuous areas of high density in the input space. The method operates on a limited memory buffer and requires at most a single scan through the data. We demonstrate the high quality of the obtained clustering solutions, their robustness to noise, and O-Cluster's excellent scalability.","","POD:0-7695-1754-4","10.1109/ICDM.2002.1183915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183915","","Clustering algorithms;Computational complexity;Data mining;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Multimedia databases;Partitioning algorithms;Sampling methods;Scalability;Shape","computational complexity;data mining;pattern clustering;very large databases","O-Cluster;active sampling technique;axis-parallel partitioning strategy;complexity;data handling;data mining;large high dimensional data sets;limited memory buffer;multidimensional data sets;scalability;scalable clustering","","16","","21","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This server-less architecture comprises homogeneous hosts, called nodes, which serve both as client and as mini-server. Video data are distributed over all nodes and these nodes cooperatively stream video data to one another for playback. However, unlike traditional video server that runs on high-end server hardware in a carefully controlled and protected data centre, a node in a server less system is likely to be far more unreliable. Therefore it is essential that sufficient data and capacity redundancies are incorporated to maintain an acceptable set-vice reliability. This paper presents and analyzes a fault tolerant mechanism based on inter-node striping and erasure correction codes to tackle this challenge. By formulating the system's reliability as a Markov chain model, we obtain insights into the feasible operating region of the system, such as the amount of redundancy required and the node-level reliability that can be tolerated. Numerical results show that a server-less VoD system of 200 nodes can achieve reliability surpassing that of dedicated video server using a redundancy overhead of only 21.2% even though individual nodes are highly unreliable.","1521-9097;15219097","POD:0-7695-1760-9","10.1109/ICPADS.2002.1183446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183446","","Buildings;Control systems;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Information retrieval;Maintenance;Protection;Redundancy;Streaming media","client-server systems;fault tolerant computing;redundancy;video on demand","Markov chain model;capacity redundancies;client;cooperative video data streaming;data redundancies;erasure correction codes;fault-tolerant mechanism;homogeneous hosts;inter-node striping;mini-server;nodes;playback;redundancy overhead;server-less video-on-demand system;service reliability","","9","3","15","","","17-20 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Vector spatial data is difficult to generalise (that is, to derive a suitable level of detail, or LoD, of the data for a given application). In a client-server environment, excessive details of spatial data cannot always be appreciated on the client side, but could consume a significant amount of resources on both the server and the client side, not to mention the extra cost of data transfer. Spatial data generalisation has been investigated extensively in the area of cartography. Most cartographical generalisation algorithms, however, are post-query operations where all the data, including unneeded data, is retrieved from the database for simplification. We incorporate spatial data simplification algorithms into query processing within DBMS. This novel approach targets primarily Web-based and mobile spatial applications that stand to benefit from early data reduction.

If the training of the classifier is also quick, this could become in some application domains a good asset for the classifier. Many techniques and algorithms for automatic text categorization have been devised. According to published literature, some are more accurate than others, and some provide more interpretable classification models than others. However, none can combine all the beneficial properties enumerated above. In this paper we present a novel approach for automatic text categorization that borrows from market basket analysis techniques using association rule mining in the data-mining field. We focus on two major problems: (1) finding the best term association rules in a textual database by generating and pruning; and (2) using the rules to build a text classifier. Our text categorization method proves to be efficient and effective, and experiments on well-known collections show that the classifier performs well.

Proceedings.","20030228","2002","","","457","464","The problem of disconnection from network is one that mobile users always have to face in mobile computing environment. Disconnected operation is one approach to ease this problem by allowing client computers to work solely on cached files in the local disks. However, a cache miss in disconnected operation is often critical, and usually causes the user to stop work on the current task until reconnecting to the server. To avoid such situations, we propose an approach called cache cooperation, which resolves cache misses in a coordinated manner among the clients. Cache cooperation allows each client to retrieve the missing data from the other remote clients when the client is disconnected from the server but not isolated from others. We describe the design of our prototype implementation, its performance measurement, and the results of vast numbers of simulations that we conducted with system-call traces recorded over 3-month period. The measured performance shows that the overhead of our approach is almost comparable to that of the normal client-server file operations. Moreover, the simulation results confirm that our approach can effectively decrease cache misses when multiple client caches can be utilized. Especially, in ideal cases where major files are shared by multiple clients, our approach saves almost all of cache misses for over 70 percent of simulation runs.","1521-9097;15219097","POD:0-7695-1760-9","10.1109/ICPADS.2002.1183439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183439","","Computational modeling;Computer networks;File servers;Information retrieval;Information systems;Measurement;Mobile computing;Spine;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual prototyping","cache storage;client-server systems;mobile computing","cache cooperation;cache miss;client server system;disconnected operation;missing data retrieval;mobile computing;state transition","","2","6","16","","","17-20 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is not energy efficient for wireless mobile equipment to use data broadcast if the receivers have to stay awake while waiting for a desired data item without knowing when it will appear on the air. For this reason, some indexing schemes are designed that allow a wireless client to retrieve a pointer to the required data item on air first. Thereafter, the client can go to doze mode until the required data item appears on the channel. Performance results show indexing schemes can reduce energy consumption tremendously. Meanwhile, these schemes do not support concurrency when an application involves wireless mobile clients that run multiple-operation transactions and dynamically update the server database. Therefore, the paper presents an efficient indexing method for wireless data broadcast in systems supporting dynamic updates from client transactions.","","POD:0-7803-7547-5","10.1109/ICCCAS.2002.1180638","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180638","","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Concurrency control;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Indexing;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Network servers;Transaction databases","Internet;concurrency control;data communication;information retrieval;mobile radio;power consumption;radio broadcasting","Internet applications;asymmetric communication;concurrency control;dynamic updates;energy consumption;indexing method;multiple-operation transactions;wireless applications;wireless data broadcast;wireless mobile equipment","","1","","5","","","29 June-1 July 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from those of the traditional data, the features of market-basket data are known to be of high dimensionality, sparsity, and with massive outliers. Without explicitly considering the presence of the taxonomy, most prior efforts on clustering market-basket data can be viewed as dealing with items in the leaf level of the taxonomy tree. Clustering transactions across different levels of the taxonomy is of great importance for marketing strategies as well as for the result representation of the clustering techniques for market-basket data. In view of the features of market-basket data, we devise a measurement, called the category-based adherence, and utilize this measurement to perform the clustering. The distance of an item to a given cluster is defined as the number of links between this item and its nearest large node in the taxonomy tree where a large node is an item or a category node whose occurrence count exceeds a given threshold. The category-based adherence of a transaction to a cluster is then defined as the average distance of the items in this transaction to that cluster With this category-based adherence measurement, we develop an efficient clustering algorithm, called algorithm CBA, for market-basket data with the objective to minimize the category-based adherence. A validation model based on information gain is also devised to assess the quality of clustering for market-basket data. As validated by both real and synthetic datasets, it is shown by our experimental results, with the taxonomy information, algorithm CBA significantly outperforms the prior works in both the execution efficiency and the clustering quality for market-basket data.","","POD:0-7695-1754-4","10.1109/ICDM.2002.1184000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184000","","Association rules;Clustering algorithms;Data analysis;Data engineering;Data mining;Information retrieval;Integrated circuit modeling;Machine learning;Taxonomy;Tellurium","data mining;entropy;marketing;pattern clustering","category node;category-based adherence;data clustering;market-basket data;marketing strategies;taxonomy;transactions clustering","","1","","23","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From an educational perspective the fact that a vast number of images on a number of topics are readily available and are in some cases free is a very helpful thing. With the rapidly expanding nature of the net however, it is becoming increasingly difficult to search out and retrieve relevant images. The aim of this study was to analyze users' behavior during image retrieval exercises. Results revealed that users tend to follow a set search strategy: firstly they input one or two keyword search terms one after another and view the images generated by their initial search and after they navigate their way around the web by using the 'back to home' or 'previous page' buttons. These results are consistent with existing Web research. Many of the actions recorded revealed that subjects' behavior differed depending on if the task set was presented as a closed or open task. In contrast no differences were found for the time subjects took to perform a single action or their use of the AND operator.","","POD:0-7695-1509-6","10.1109/CIE.2002.1186301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186301","","Digital images;Humans;Image analysis;Image databases;Image generation;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Internet;Keyword search;Navigation","Internet;computer aided instruction;image retrieval;meta data;query formulation","AND operator;Internet;closed task;digital images;image retrieval behavior;keyword search;metadata type image database;open task;search strategy;users' behavior analysis","","0","","","","","3-6 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our experiments show that, for the test data sets used, the DSE algorithm can correctly identify data-rich sections of HTML pages with 100% accuracy. Therefore, it can effectively reduce the root set size for the topic distillation problem thereby improving the precision and accuracy of the IETS algorithm.

Two related key issues are achieving an efficient content-based retrieval and a fast response time. Relevance feedback is a powerful tool to improve the retrieval results of the CBIR systems. However the traditional relevance feedback could only search a small feature subspace comparing with the entire huge feature space. So, this paper provides solutions to enlarge the searching feature subspace in a CBIR system, effectively. Firstly, an adaptive system query strategy to user behaviors is introduced to improve the performance of relevance feedback. Then a feedback scheme based on multi-features classification is developed. Both tactics enlarge the searching feature subspace efficiently. From experimental results, it is clear that the feedback scheme has a much better performance than the traditional CBIR systems. To develop such a scheme, a new effective texture feature and an efficient way to measure the dis-similarity between two image features are proposed in the CBIR system, which provides solutions to a general query on a large image database with 56,600 images.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1174560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174560","","Content based retrieval;Electronic mail;Feedback;Image classification;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information processing;Information retrieval;Mars;Multimedia databases","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;multimedia databases;relevance feedback","content-based image retrieval system;fast response time;feedback learning;image database;low-level features;multi-features classification;multimedia databases;relevance feedback;semantic image retrieval;similarity metric","","3","","24","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The similarity is defined through a balanced combination between global and regional similarity measures incorporating all the features. In order to further improve the retrieval efficiency, a secondary clustering technique is developed and employed to significantly save query processing time without compromising the retrieval precision.

With this group of features, the class of object can be separated with others most distinctly. Based on this idea, using SVM (Support Vector Machine), HGM (Hybrid Gauss Model), PCA (principle component analysis) and FFC (Forward Feature Combination), we design and implement an Object Template that can represent a kind of object (such as tiger) perfectly and then present its two applications.

However spherical k-means can often yield qualitatively poor results, especially when cluster sizes are small, say 25-30 documents per cluster, where it tends to get stuck at a local maximum far away from the optimal solution. In this paper, we present a local search procedure, which we call 'first-variation"" that refines a given clustering by incrementally moving data points between clusters, thus achieving a higher objective function value. An enhancement of first variation allows a chain of such moves in a Kernighan-Lin fashion and leads to a better local maximum. Combining the enhanced first-variation with spherical k-means yields a powerful ""ping-pong"" strategy that often qualitatively improves k-means clustering and is computationally efficient. We present several experimental results to highlight the improvement achieved by our proposed algorithm in clustering high-dimensional and sparse text data.","","POD:0-7695-1754-4","10.1109/ICDM.2002.1183895","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183895","","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Euclidean distance;Frequency;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Mathematics;Refining;Statistics","data mining;pattern clustering;search problems;text analysis","cosine similarity;document collection clustering;first variation;high dimensional text data;incremental data point movement;iterative clustering;local maximum;local search;objective function value;ping-pong strategy;sparse text data clustering;spherical k-means algorithm","","23","","18","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Finally, a new distance, with weight functions, is calculated using the similarity functions, and the results are sorted. By selecting weight functions, we can reflect the impression of texture features flexibly in retrieval. The effectiveness of retrieval is demonstrated in simulations with a database of several color texture images.","","POD:0-7803-7488-6","10.1109/ICOSP.2002.1181130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181130","","Color;Humans;Image classification;Image resolution;Image retrieval;Image texture analysis;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Pixel;Shape","feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image resolution;image retrieval;image segmentation;image texture;visual databases","color image retrieval;color texture retrieval;image classification;image database;multi-resolution mosaic;randomness;shape;similarity function;structure;texture feature extraction;weight functions","","0","","","","","26-30 Aug. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It not only reflects the nested structure of semi-structured data, but also distinguishes between object classes and relationship types, and between attributes of object classes and attributes of relationship types. ORA-SS can specify the degree of n-ary relationship types and indicate if an attribute is an attribute of a relationship type or an attribute of an object class. Existing semi-structured data models cannot specify such information. We use this information to translate XML Schemas/DTD to ORA-SS schemas, then to object-relational databases correctly and without avoidable redundancy.

Most watermarking methods for images and video can be viewed as a communications problem in which the watermark must be transmitted and received through a watermark channel. This channel includes distortions resulting from attacks and interference from the original digital data. It is well accepted that an effective watermarking scheme may be described as the secure, imperceptible, robust communication of information by direct embedding in, and retrieval from, digital data. For verifying the security and robustness of watermarking algorithms, specific attacks have to be applied to test them. By using a theoretical approach based on random processes, signal processes, and communication theory, we propose a stochastic formulation of a new watermarking attack using a blind source separation-based concept. The proposed attack considers the watermarking channel as a ""black-box"". A host image was passed through the ""black-box"", which includes the watermarking embedding process, and then the watermarked image was produced The watermarked image is viewed as linear mixtures of unknown source signals, and we attempt to recover sources from their linear mixtures without resorting to any prior knowledge by using blind source separation theory.","","POD:0-7695-1857-5","10.1109/MMSE.2002.1181611","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181611","","Data analysis;Information retrieval;Interference;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Signal processing;Source separation;Spread spectrum communication;Watermarking","blind source separation;copy protection;copyright;image coding;multimedia systems;random processes;security of data;stochastic processes;video coding;watermarking","BSS;black-box;blind source separation based theory;communication theory;copyrighted multimedia data;digital watermarking attacks;distortions;host image;illegally made copies;interference;linear unknown source signal mixtures;networks;random processes;secure imperceptible robust information communication;security;servers;signal processes;stochastic formulation;video;watermark channel;watermarked image;watermarking algorithms;watermarking embedding process","","0","","18","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With vector-based natural language call routing, callers are transferred using a routing matrix trained on statistics of occurrence of words and word sequences in a training corpus. By re-training the routing matrix parameters using a minimum classification error criterion, a relative error rate reduction of 10-30% was achieved on a banking task. Increased robustness was demonstrated in that with 10% rejection, the error rate was reduced by 40%. Discriminative training also improves portability; we were able to train call routers with the highest known performance using as input only text transcription of routed calls, without any human intervention or knowledge about what terms are important or irrelevant for the routing task. This strategy was validated with both the banking task and a more difficult task involving calls to operators in the UK.

In this paper, we define a primitive function to sketch the principle. Then an example based on locating the centers on a triangle is illustrated to fulfill our idea. In our scheme, the stored keys are generated in geometric ways, and are used for user authentication later. In such a way, attacks based on penetrating the stored table are prevented.

Proceedings.","20030228","2002","","","94","105","We present a new verifiable secret redistribution protocol for threshold sharing schemes that forms a key component of a proposed archival storage system. Our protocol supports redistribution from (m,n) to (m',n') threshold sharing schemes without requiring reconstruction of the original data. The design is motivated by archive systems for which the added security of threshold sharing of data must be accompanied by the flexibility of dynamic shareholder changes. Our protocol enables the dynamic addition or removal of shareholders, and also guards against mobile adversaries. We observe that existing protocols either cannot be extended readily to allow redistribution between different access structures, or have vulnerabilities that allow faulty old shareholders to distribute invalid shares to new shareholders. Our primary contribution is that in our protocol, new shareholders can verify the validity of their shares after redistribution between different access structures.","","POD:0-7695-1888-5","10.1109/SISW.2002.1183515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183515","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Cryptography;Data security;Delay;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;File servers;Government;Information retrieval","cryptography;transport protocols","archival storage system;dynamic shareholder changes;invalid shares;mobile adversaries;threshold sharing schemes;verifiable secret redistribution protocol","","10","4","46","","","11 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20030219","2002","2","","1024","1027 vol.2","In information retrieval (IR) systems, such as Okapi, there are always a variety of parameters to be set manually which are data-dependent and most sensitive to retrieval performance. Therefore, it will be ideal to deploy an automatic parameter learning mechanism. In this paper, we propose such a method based on the genetic algorithm. We apply our approach to the Okapi system. Experimental results on TREC2001 testing data indicate that our algorithm is effective to adjust system parameters and improve the retrieval performance significantly.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1174538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174538","","Biological cells;Evolutionary computation;Feedback;Genetic algorithms;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Machine learning;Space technology;System testing;Training data","genetic algorithms;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","Okapi system;TREC2001 testing data;fitness function;genetic algorithm;information retrieval;machine learning;parameter learning","","0","","8","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is shown that BTC can not only be used for compressing color images, it can also be conveniently used for content-based image retrieval from image databases. From the BTC compressed stream (without performing decoding), we derive two image content description features, one termed the block color co-occurrence matrix (BCCM) and the other block pattern histogram (BPH). We use BCCM and BPH to compute the similarity measures of images for content-based image retrieval applications. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate that BCCM and BPH are comparable to similar state of the art techniques.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2002.807356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187364","","Color;Content based retrieval;Decoding;Histograms;Image coding;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Streaming media","content-based retrieval;data compression;image coding;image colour analysis;image retrieval;matrix algebra;visual databases","block color co-occurrence matrix;block pattern histogram;block truncation coding;color image compression;color image indexing;content-based image retrieval;image coding;image content description features;image databases;image similarity measures","","54","1","23","","","Jan 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It can be made by exploiting a large set of parallel texts. We describe a mining system that automatically discovers parallel Web pages on the Web. This system exploits the existing search engines, and the common characteristics in the organization of Web pages. Several large text corpora have been constructed using this system. Our experiments show that query translation using the obtained corpora can be as good as those by high-quality machine translation systems. This study shows the feasibility of building automatically a query translation system for all the active languages on the Web.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175387","","Buildings;Costs;Cybernetics;Dictionaries;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Natural languages;Search engines;Web pages","Web sites;data mining;dynamic programming;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;query processing;search engines","cross-language information retrieval;mining system;parallel Web pages;parallel texts;query translation;search engines;translation models","","0","1","14","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
