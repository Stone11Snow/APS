Many unimodal hashing studies have proven that both similarity preservation of data and maintenance of quantization quality are essential for improving retrieval performance with binary hash codes. However, most existing cross-modal hashing methods mainly have focused on the former, and the latter still remains almost untouched. We propose a method to minimize the binary quantization errors, which is tailored to cross-modal hashing. Our approach, named Alternating Co-Quantization (ACQ), alternately seeks binary quantizers for each modality space with the help of connections to other modality data so that they give minimal quantization errors while preserving data similarities. ACQ can be coupled with various existing cross-modal dimension reduction methods such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and substantially boosts their retrieval performance in the Hamming space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACQ can outperform several state-of-the-art methods, even when it is combined with simple CCA.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8391-2; POD:978-1-4673-8392-9","10.1109/ICCV.2015.219","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410576","","Binary codes;Computer vision;Correlation;Databases;Encoding;Quantization (signal);Symmetric matrices","Hamming codes;file organisation;information retrieval;unsupervised learning","ACQ;CCA;alternating co-quantization;binary hash code;binary quantization error;canonical correlation analysis;cross-modal dimension reduction method;cross-modal hashing method;cross-modal retrieval;hamming space;quantization quality maintenance;similarity data preservation;unimodal hashing;unsupervised learning","","3","","39","","","7-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then a partially observed video is considered as an activity prefix, consisting of one or more characters. Finally, the missing observation of an activity is predicted as the activity candidates provided by the auto-completion model. The candidates are matched against the activity prefix on-the-fly and ranked by a learning-to-rank algorithm. We validate our method on UT-Interaction Set #1 and Set #2 [19].

It can be expected that each sentence of a document is composed of a subject and an object, where the subject is defined in relation to its object. Using ""definition"" and ""use"" relations, we may thus identify the subjects in a given document by looking for keyphrases which appear frequently as subjects of sentences in the document. We thus present a subject-keyphrase extraction (SKE) algorithm based on the notion of definition-use chain (DU Chain) to identify subject-keyphrases.

NDN is a data centric, rather than host centric, approach to discovery and retrieval of information distributed across a network. This paradigm shift results in a host of new challenges, one of which is authentication of data and data-sources. NDN requires each content producer to digitally sign each data packet it produces. While the use of digital signatures certainly accomplishes data and data source authentication, it imposes significant overhead on the whole network. In this paper, we propose a novel data and source authentication mechanism that relies primarily on hashing. The mechanism utilizes hash chaining to ensure that unauthorized modification, insertion, or deletion of data can be easily detected by routers and content consumers.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7194-0; POD:978-1-4673-7195-7","10.1109/ISCC.2015.7405641","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405641","Data Authentication;Hash Chains;Named Data Net-working","Authentication;Computer architecture;Digital signatures;IP networks;Public key;Seals","Internet;cryptography;digital signatures;information retrieval","IP networking replacement;NDN;data authentication;data centric approach;data source authentication mechanism;digital signatures;hash chains;information retrieval;named data networking;next generation Internet architecture","","","","12","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Answers and Stack Overflow, represent a well-known example of collective intelligence. The existing CQA systems, despite their overall successfulness and popularity, fail to answer a significant amount of questions in required time. One option for scaffolding collaboration in CQA systems is a recommendation of new questions to users who are suitable candidates for providing correct answers (so called question routing). Various methods have been proposed so far to find appropriate answerers, but almost all approaches heavily depend on previous users' activities in a particular CQA system (i.e. QA-data). In our work, we attempt to involve a whole community including users with no or minimal previous activity (e.g. newcomers or lurkers). We proposed a question routing method which analyses users' non-QA data from a CQA system itself as well as from external services and platforms, such as blogs, micro-blogs or social networking sites, in order to estimate users' interests and expertise early and more precisely. Consequently, we can recommend new questions to a wider part of a community as well as more accurately. Evaluation on a dataset from Stack Exchange platform showed that considering non-QA data leads not only to better recognition of users with low activity as suitable answerers, but also to higher overall precision of the recommendations. It implies that non-QA data can supplement QA data during expertise estimation in question routing and thus also improve a success rate of a questions answering process.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3854-7; POD:978-1-5090-2094-2","10.1145/2808797.2809331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403532","community question answering;expertise estimation;non-qa data;question recommendation;question routing","Blogs;Collaboration;Estimation;Knowledge discovery;Routing;Search engines;Social network services","question answering (information retrieval);recommender systems;social networking (online)","CQA systems;Stack Exchange platform;Stack Overflow;Yahoo!

MAs collect results migrating from one node to another. MAs have a small size and a low requirement of network bandwidth, they also reduce the load of the network making a Mobile Agent System (MAS) a preferred solution in distributed applications. Intelligent Vehicular Communication Systems are an excellent exemplary candidate for such applications. Although MAs flexibility is a great add on to application however, ensuring their security is considered a challenging task due to its network openness. In this paper, a novel Secure Mobile Agent Protocol (SMAP) dedicated for Vehicular Communication Systems is proposed. SMAP provides the essential security requirements e.g. mutual authentication, confidentiality, integrity, accountability, non repudiation and authorization. Using SMAP owner vehicles receive results as soon as they are requested and therefore, providing fast information retrieval process. Moreover, another important feature of SMAP is that unlike other protocols the loss of the MA does not necessary mean the loss of all the collected data. Furthermore, SMAP guarantees protection from many security attacks such as, Man In The Middle (MITM), replay, masquerade, modification and unauthorized access attacks. Verified using the well known formal verification tool Scyther, SMAP is proven to be a suitable protocol for securing vehicular communication links from malicious actions.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8511-4; POD:978-1-4673-8512-1","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2015.7381521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381521","","Authentication;Authorization;Mobile agents;Protocols;Vehicles","authorisation;automobiles;cryptographic protocols;data integrity;data protection;formal verification;information retrieval;mobile agents;traffic engineering computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","MAS;MITM attack;SMAP;Scyther formal verification tool;data accountability;data authorization;data confidentiality;data integrity;data nonrepudiation;data protection;distributed applications;information retrieval process;intelligent software;intelligent vehicular communication systems;man-in-the-middle attack;masquerade attack;mobile agent system;modification attack;mutual authentication;network bandwidth;network load reduction;replay attack;secure mobile agent protocol;unauthorized access attack","","","","32","","","1-3 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve this problem, we are studying the automatic evaluation of research impact using Twitter. Researchers participating in academic conferences often post their opinions or comments on Twitter. Here, research papers (presentations) that have many comments are considered to be outstanding and to have strong impact during the conference. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically aligning tweets with research papers. The procedure consists of the following three steps: (1) detecting valuable tweets, (2) aligning each valuable tweet with a research paper, and (3) calculating the research impact of each research paper by the number of aligned tweets.

The drawback of that approach is that it is not suitable for solving large problems. This paper presents a multiple-retrieval approach that partitions the attribute graph of the large problem into small solvable sub-problems by recursively inputting the unsolved part of the graph into the decision tree for retrieval. The adaptation combines the retrieved partial solutions of all the partitioned sub-problems and employs a graph heuristic method to construct the whole solution for the new case.

"Generalized Learning of Neural Network Based Semantic Similarity Models and Its Application in Movie Search","X. Ye; Z. Qi; X. Song; X. He; D.

However these neural network based latent semantic models are mostly trained by using simple user behavior logging data such as clicked (query, document)-pairs, and all the clicked pairs are assumed to be uniformly positive examples. Therefore, the existing method for learning the model parameters does not differentiate data samples that might reflect different relevance information. In this paper, we relax this assumption and propose a new learning method through a generalized loss function to capture the subtle relevance differences of training samples when a more granular label structure is available. We have applied it to the Xbox One's movie search task where session-based user behavior information is available and the granular relevance differences of training samples are derived from the session logs. Compared with the existing method, our new generalized loss function has demonstrated superior test performance measured by several user-engagement metrics. It also yields significant performance lift when the score computed from our model is used as a semantic similarity feature in the gradient boosted decision tree model which is widely used in modern search engines.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8493-3; POD:978-1-4673-8494-0","10.1109/ICDMW.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395657","click logs;loss function;movie search;neural network;semantic model","Computational modeling;Decision support systems;Motion pictures;Neural networks;Search engines;Semantics;Web search","cinematography;decision trees;gradient methods;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;search engines","Xbox One movie search task;clicked-pairs;generalized learning;generalized loss function;gradient boosted decision tree model;granular relevance differences;information retrieval tasks;learning method;modern search engines;movie search;neural network based latent semantic models;neural network based semantic similarity models;performance lift;session logs;session-based user behavior information;text semantic similarity;user behavior logging data;user-engagement metrics","","","","22","","","14-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary methods are pattern matching and supervised learning. Since the coverage of patterns is limited due to poor adaptability and supervised learning needs a large number of labeled data that expensive, both are hard to process the massive and diverse web texts. Inspired by frequency statistics, which is an important technique of unsupervised relation extraction, this paper puts forward a novel approach to automatically extracting geo-entity relations without much manual effort. Firstly, we translate relation extraction to a problem of keyword extraction, and analyze the characteristics of word (part-of-speech, position and distance to entity) by means of bootstrapping. Secondly, calculate the weight of each word in one sentence with a pair of geo-entities based on the statistic results of characteristics, and pick out the word with the maximum weight as the relation of one pair of geo-entities. Lastly, we construct relation instances to obtain the structured information. In the experiment, we used bootstrapping to evaluate the precision and recall based on popular Sina Travel and BaiduBaike in Chinese and compared with three frequency statistic approaches (Frequency, TF-IDF and PPMI). The presented method is argued has following advantages: (1) it can automatically explore the lexical features from natural language texts, which neither the domain expert knowledge nor large scale corpora need, and breaks the restriction of closed relation types. (2) Compared with three classical frequency statistics methods, the precision and recall are improved by 5% and 23% respectively.","2161-024X;2161024X","Electronic:978-1-4673-7663-1; POD:978-1-4673-7664-8","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2015.7378569","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378569","bootstrapping;geo-entity;relation extraction;text mining;web texts","Manuals;Ontologies","geographic information systems;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;social networking (online);statistical analysis;text analysis","BaiduBaike;Chinese;Sina Travel;Web texts;bootstrapping algorithm;closed relation types;frequency statistic approaches;frequency statistics;geo-entity relation extraction;geographical information retrieval;keyword extraction;natural language texts;online encyclopedia;pattern matching;semantic relations;spatial relations;supervised learning;unsupervised relation extraction","","","","21","","","19-21 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Semantic web understands the meaning of data and can make intelligent decision based on available data. To build up the necessary web information and their relationship or the ontology for the semantic web, creation of valid RDF document is needed.

URI fragment identifiers for CSV provide possibilities for data publishers (web servers) to refer to specific parts (i.e., fragments) of a CSV file using URIs as well as for data consumers (web clients) to retrieve URI-identified fragments over HTTP for further processing. However, few studies have focused on CSV fragment retrieval, and to our knowledge, so far there are no implementations of CSV fragment identifiers compliant web clients/servers. This study addresses the issue of implementation strategies for CSV fragment retrieval over the HTTP protocol. Two strategies (i.e., client-side fragment evaluation and server-side fragment evaluation) including the fragment evaluation algorithms were proposed and then implemented in order to demonstrate the implementability of CSV fragment retrieval over HTTP and to experimentally observe and compare the run-time efficiency of the two strategies. The results indicate that server-side fragment evaluation is a more efficient strategy in terms of running time and bandwidth cost, but requires extensions for existing web servers, whereas client-side fragment evaluation is the opposite. Our methods and findings provide valuable reference for potential implementers.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9372-0; POD:978-1-4673-9373-7","10.1109/WISA.2015.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396640","CSV fragment retrieval;Comma-Separated Values (CSV);HTTP;URI;Web client-server interaction;fragment identifiers for text/csv","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Java;Protocols;Prototypes;Web servers","Internet;client-server systems;file servers;hypermedia;information retrieval;transport protocols","CSV file;CSV format;CSV fragment identifiers compliant Web client-servers;CSV fragment retrieval;HTTP protocol;URI fragment identifiers;URI-identified fragments;Web servers;client-side fragment evaluation;comma-separated value format;data publishers;fragment evaluation algorithms;server-side fragment evaluation;tabular data","","","","9","","","11-13 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, adoption of MBT technologies in industry is slow and many testing tasks are performed via manually created executable test cases (i.e. test programs such as JUnit). In order to adopt MBT, testers must learn how to construct models and use these models to generate test cases, which might be a hurdle. An interesting observation in our previous work is that the existing manually created test cases often provided invaluable insights for the manual creation of the testing models of the system. In this paper we present an approach that allows the tester to first create and debug a set of test cases. When the tester is happy with the test cases, the next step is to automatically generate a model from the test cases. The generated model is derived from the test cases, which are actions that the system can perform (e.g. a button clicks) and their expected outputs in form of assert statements (e.g. assert data entered). The model is a Finite State Machine (FSM) model that can be employed with little or no manual changes to generate additional test cases for the SUT. We successfully applied the approach in a feasibility study to the NASA Data Access Toolkit (DaT), which is a web-based GUI. One compelling finding is that the test cases that were generated from the automatically generated models were able to detect issues that were not detected by the original set of manually created test cases. We present the findings from the case study and discuss best practices for incorporating model generation techniques into an existing testing process.","","CD-ROM:978-1-5090-0405-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0406-5; POD:978-1-5090-0407-2","10.1109/ISSRE.2015.7381801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381801","Model Generation;Model-based Testing;State Machines","Automata;Data models;Graphical user interfaces;Manuals;NASA;Selenium;Testing","Internet;graphical user interfaces;information retrieval;program debugging;program testing","FSM model;MBT technology;NASA DAT Web-application;NASA data access toolkit;SUT behavior;Web-based GUI;finite state machine model;model generation technique;model-based testing;software testing;system under test behavior;versatile testing technology","","","","21","","","2-5 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A notable property of TarDPR is its ability to effectively incorporate different types of social features and produce new meaningful features that help competitive approaches to significantly improve their recommendation quality. We derive an iterative algorithm for TarDPR that is supported by mathematical analysis, and is efficient on large social traces. To certify the usability of our approach, we conduct empirical experiments on real social traces including Facebook and Foursquare social networks. The competitive experimental results show that TarDPR achieves up to 15% improvement in comparison with other competitive methods. These results consequently confirm the efficacy of our suggested framework.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3854-7; POD:978-1-5090-2094-2","10.1145/2808797.2809414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403563","","Computers;Facebook;Mathematical analysis;Twitter;Visualization","information retrieval;iterative methods;recommender systems;social networking (online)","DPR-based feature selection;Facebook;Foursquare social network;TarDPR;friend recommendation;iterative algorithm;online social network;targeted dot product representation","","","","20","","","25-28 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is content, such as news or posts at social network groups, for which a user typically loses interest after some days or hours. Thus development of a timely crawling policy for ephemeral information sources is very important. We first formulate this problem as an optimal control problem with average reward. The reward can be measured in terms of the number of clicks or relevant search requests. The problem in its exact formulation suffers from the curse of dimensionality and quickly becomes intractable even with moderate number of information sources. Fortunately, this problem admits a Whittle index, a celebrated heuristics which leads to problem decomposition and to a very simple and efficient crawling policy. We derive the Whittle index and provide its theoretical justification.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-7884-7; Electronic:978-1-4799-7886-1; POD:978-1-4799-7887-8","10.1109/CDC.2015.7403283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403283","","Aerospace electronics;Crawlers;Dynamic programming;Indexes;Optimal control;Silicon;Social network services","information retrieval;scheduling;social networking (online)","Web sites crawling;crawler scheduling;ephemeral content crawling;ephemeral information sources;heuristics;optimal control problem;social network groups;whittle index policy","","1","","28","","","15-18 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While they naturally build-in an online social network infrastructure, they carry a very different purpose from Facebook-like social networks, where users ""hang-out"" with their friends and tend to share more personal information. It is unclear, thus, how the privacy concerns and their correlation with user behavior in an online social network translate into a CQA platform. This study analyzes one year of recorded traces from a mature CQA platform to understand the association between users' privacy concerns as manifested by their account settings and their activity in the platform. The results show that privacy preference is correlated with behavior in the community in terms of engagement, retention, accomplishments and deviance from the norm. We find privacy-concerned users have higher qualitative and quantitative contributions, show higher retention, report more abuses, have higher perception on answer quality and have larger social circles. However, at the same time, these users also exhibit more deviant behavior than the users with public profiles.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3854-7; POD:978-1-5090-2094-2","10.1145/2808797.2809422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403616","Community question answering;crowdsourcing;privacy concerns","Correlation;Data privacy;Facebook;Guidelines;Knowledge discovery;Privacy","data privacy;question answering (information retrieval);social networking (online)","CQA platform;community question answering;online social network;user privacy","","","","40","","","25-28 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This step is used to bootstrap more sophisticated data collection from directly related but much richer content sources. In particular we demonstrate that valuable information can be collected by following URLs included in tweets. We automatically extract content from the corresponding web pages and treating each web page as a document linked to the original tweet show how a temporal topic model based on a hierarchical Dirichlet process can be used to track the evolution of a complex topic structure of a Twitter community.

Most existing searchable encryption schemes are in the single-user setting. There are only few schemes in the multiple data users setting, i.e., encrypted data sharing. Among these schemes, most of the early techniques depend on a trusted third party with interactive search protocols or need cumbersome key management. To remedy the defects, the most recent approaches borrow ideas from attribute-based encryption to enable attribute-based keyword search (ABKS). However, all these schemes incur high computational costs and are not suitable for mobile devices, such as mobile phones, with power consumption constraints. In this paper, we develop new techniques that split the computation for the keyword encryption and trapdoor/token generation into two phases: a preparation phase that does the vast majority of the work to encrypt a keyword or create a token before it knows the keyword or the attribute list/access control policy that will be used. A second phase then rapidly assembles an intermediate ciphertext or trapdoor when the specifics become known. The preparation work can be performed while the mobile device is plugged into a power source, then it can later rapidly perform keyword encryption or token generation operations on the move without significantly draining the battery. We name our scheme Online/Offline ABKS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on constructing efficient multi-user searchable encryption scheme for mobile devices through moving the majority of the cost of keyword encryption and token generation into an offline phase.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5785-4; POD:978-1-4673-8669-2","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384308","Mobile Devices;Multi-Owner/Multi-User;Offline;Online;Power Consumption;Searchable Encryption","Cloud computing;Encryption;Keyword search;Search problems;Servers","authorisation;cryptography;data protection;information retrieval;mobile computing;power aware computing","attribute list-access control policy;attribute-based encryption;attribute-based keyword search;data owners;data privacy protection;data user setting;encrypted data sharing;intermediate ciphertext;keyword encryption;mobile devices;mobile phones;multiuser searchable encryption scheme;offline ABKS;online ABKS;power consumption constraints;preparation phase;token generation;trapdoor generation","","","","22","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions. Moreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended answers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be provided in a multiple-choice format.

Community detection algorithms are then useful to reveal the sub-structures of a network and in particular interest groups. Identifying these users' communities and the interests that bind them can help us assist their life-cycle. Certain kinds of online communities such as question-and-answer (Q&A) sites or forums, have no explicit social network structure. Therefore, many traditional community detection techniques do not apply directly. In this paper, we propose TTD (Topic Trees Distributions) an efficient approach for extracting topic from Q&A sites in order to detect communities of interest. Then we compare three detection methods we applied on a dataset extracted from the popular Q&A site StackOverflow. Our method based on topic modeling and user membership assignment is shown to be much simpler and faster while preserving the quality of the detection.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9618-9; POD:978-1-4673-9619-6","10.1109/WI-IAT.2015.184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396788","","Cascading style sheets;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Detection algorithms;HTML;Layout;Social network services","question answering (information retrieval);social networking (online)","Q and A sites;StackOverflow;TTD;online communities;overlapping community of interest detection;overlapping community of interest labeling;question-and-answer sites;social network structure;topic extraction;topic modeling;topic trees distributions;user membership assignment","","","","23","","","6-9 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, with accumulation of users and contents in CQA platforms, their answer quality has aroused wide concern. Expert finding has been proposed as one way to address such problem, which aims at finding suitable answerers who can give high-quality answers. In this paper, we formalize expert finding as a learning to rank task by leveraging the user feedback on answers (i.e., the votes of answers) as the ""relevance"" labels. To achieve this task, we present a listwise learning to rank approach, which is referred to as ListEF. In the ListEF approach, realizing that questions in CQA are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive high-quality topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we develop a COmpetition-based User exPertise Extraction (COUPE) method to capture user expertise features for given questions. We adopt the widely used listwise learning to rank method LambdaMART to train the ranking function. Finally, for a given question, we rank candidate users in descending order of the scores calculated by the trained ranking function, and select the users with high rankings as candidate experts. Experimental results on Stack Overflow show both our TTM and ListEF approach are effective with significant improvements over state-of-art methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8493-3; POD:978-1-4673-8494-0","10.1109/ICDMW.2015.181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395685","","Aggregates;Conferences;Feature extraction;Knowledge discovery;Resource management;Training;Training data","Internet;question answering (information retrieval)","COUPE;CQA;LambdaMART;ListEF approach;TTM;answer quality;community question answering;competition-based user expertise extraction method;expert finding;high-quality answers;high-quality topical representations;online service;relevance labels;stack overflow;tagword topic model;trained ranking function;user feedback","","","","24","","","14-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Lastly, we inferred the general sentiment of the clinical notes toward each parameter by gauging the average distance between positive and negative keywords and all other terms in the space. We found intriguing differences in the sentiment of clinical notes over time, outcome, and demographic features.

The interest can be qualified using criteria such as recency, novelty. In the last decade, we have seen classification systems trained to detect the interest for a document regarding an entity. For scalability reasons, it is not possible to consider a manual annotation of a training set for each tracked entity. Some approaches strive to build entity independent systems. These approaches obtain the state of the art performances, but we show that they can be improved. Time features differ from one entity to another, therefore no relevant statistics can be estimated out of these observations by a single classifier. Instead of having one model per entity or one model for all entities, we propose an approach that uses one model per cluster of entities based on the entity web popularity.

The idea is to use summary knowledge about datasets along with past performance of algorithms on these datasets to build this meta-knowledge.

A trademark retrieval algorithm is developed that employs natural language processing techniques and an external knowledge source in the form of a lexical ontology. The search and indexing technique developed uses similarity distance, which is derived using Tversky's theory of similarity. The proposed retrieval algorithm is validated using two resources: a trademark database of 1400 disputed cases and a database of 378 943 company names.

Abdelzaher","","2015 IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium","20160118","2015","","","185","194","The paper describes a novel algorithm for timely sensor data retrieval in resource-poor environments under freshness constraints. Consider a civil unrest, national security, or disaster management scenario, where a dynamic situation evolves and a decision-maker must decide on a course of action in view of latest data. Since the situation changes, so is the best course of action. The scenario offers two interesting constraints. First, one should be able to successfully compute the course of action within some appropriate time window, which we call the decision deadline. Second, at the time the course of action is computed, the data it is based on must be fresh (i.e., within some corresponding validity interval). We call it the freshness constraint. These constraints create an interesting novel problem of timely data retrieval. We address this problem in resource-scarce environments, where network resource limitations require that data objects (e.g., pictures and other sensor measurements pertinent to the decision) generally remain at the sources. Hence, one must decide on (i) which objects to retrieve and (ii) in what order, such that the cost of deciding on a valid course of action is minimized while meeting data freshness and decision deadline constraints. Such an algorithm is reported in this paper. The algorithm is shown in simulation to reduce the cost of data retrieval compared to a host of baselines that consider time or resource constraints. It is applied in the context of minimizing cost of finding unobstructed routes between specified locations in a disaster zone by retrieving data on the health of individual route segments.","1052-8725;10528725","Paper:978-1-4673-9507-6","10.1109/RTSS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383576","","Bandwidth;Decision making;Earthquakes;Heuristic algorithms;Real-time systems;Roads;Sensors","data acquisition;decision making;information retrieval;minimisation;resource allocation;sensor fusion","cost minimization;data acquisition;data freshness constraint;decision deadline constraint;decision making;resource-scarce environment;sensor data retrieval","","2","","39","","","1-4 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Randomized incremental algorithms for the PageRank computation","K. You; R. Tempo; L.

First, we reformulate the PageRank computation as a least squares (LS) problem. Motivated by a random surfer model, the LS problem is solved in a randomized incremental way. Specifically, when visiting a page, the surfer incrementally updates an estimate of the PageRank by using the information from those pages connected by hyperlinks. Then, the surfer either randomly selects an outgoing link of the current page and moves to the page pointed by this link, or interrupts its search and jumps to an arbitrary page. Subsequently, the PageRank estimate is updated again. The transition between pages is naturally modeled as a Markov process. Under an ergodicity property, we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the PageRank in both the almost sure and Lp sense. A comparison with a classical PageRank algorithm is discussed as well.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-7884-7; Electronic:978-1-4799-7886-1; POD:978-1-4799-7887-8","10.1109/CDC.2015.7402238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7402238","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Convergence;Google;Internet;Mathematical model;Stochastic processes","Internet;Markov processes;information retrieval;least mean squares methods;random processes","Google PageRank;Markov process;ergodicity property;least squares problem;random surfer model;randomized incremental algorithm","","1","","23","","","15-18 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the majority of the hashing methods aim at learning more accurate hash codes, only a few of them focus on indexing methods to accelerate the search for binary code databases. Among these indexing methods, most of them suffer from extremely high memory cost or extensive Hamming distance computations. In this paper, we propose a new Hamming distance search scheme for large scale binary code databases, which is free of Hamming distance computations to return the exact results. Without the necessity to compare database binary codes with queries, the search performance can be improved and databases can be externally maintained. More specifically, we adopt the inverted multi-index data structure to index binary codes. Importantly, the Hamming distance information embedded in the structure is utilized in the designed search scheme such that the verification of exact results no longer relies on Hamming distance computations. As a step further, we optimize the performance of the inverted multi-index structure by taking the code distributions among different bits into account for index construction. Empirical results on large-scale binary code databases demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches in terms of both memory usage and search efficiency.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2016.2515990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377105","Binary Codes Indexing;Binary codes indexing;Hamming Distance Search;Hamming distance search","Binary codes;Hamming distance;Indexing;Search problems;Streaming media","database indexing;information retrieval;multimedia systems","Hamming distance search scheme;distance-computation-free search scheme;hash codes;hashing method;high-dimensional multimedia feature;indexing method;inverted multiindex data structure;large scale binary code database;multimedia application","","3","","42","","20160108","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we pursue this approach under the assumption that we do not have access to this kind of data neither, thus allowing to cope with most social networks, where users can rate items and have friendship relationships.

One such service is location based social networking (LBSN). As users of LBSN have increased, vast amounts of check-in data have become available that record where users have been and when. In this paper, we assume that a user's check-in behavior is influenced by temporal and geographical factors. For the temporal factor, we consider the temporal impact to be different for each location and understand it by smoothing check-in data on the basis of Gaussian distribution. On the other hand, for the geographical factor, we assume that a user's check-in behavior depends on the area he visits on a daily basis and propose methods to reflect detected user's behavior range in the conventional system by utilizing spatial effects. In addition, we demonstrate that integrating these factors further improves recommendation accuracy.

Traditional text similarity methods such as tf-idf cosine-similarity, based on word overlap, mostly fail to produce good results in this case, since word overlap is little or non-existent. Recently, distributed word representations, or word embeddings, have been shown to successfully allow words to match on the semantic level. In order to pair short text fragments -- as a concatenation of separate words -- an adequate distributed sentence representation is needed, in existing literature often obtained by naively combining the individual word representations. We therefore investigated several text representations as a combination of word embeddings in the context of semantic pair matching. This paper investigates the effectiveness of several such naive techniques, as well as traditional tf-idf similarity, for fragments of different lengths. Our main contribution is a first step towards a hybrid method that combines the strength of dense distributed representations -- as opposed to sparse term matching -- with the strength of tf-idf based methods to automatically reduce the impact of less informative terms. Our new approach outperforms the existing techniques in a toy experimental set-up, leading to the conclusion that the combination of word embeddings and tf-idf information might lead to a better model for semantic content within very short text fragments.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8493-3; POD:978-1-4673-8494-0","10.1109/ICDMW.2015.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395808","","Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Histograms;Internet;Media;Semantics","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);text analysis","Facebook;Twitter;dense distributed representations;distributed sentence representation;distributed word representations;information retrieval algorithms;semantic content;semantic pair matching;semantic similarity learning;short text fragments;social media;sparse term matching;text representations;text similarity methods;tf-idf cosine-similarity;very short text fragments;word embeddings","","","","15","","","14-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such automated approaches should aim to classify questions as good or bad for a particular forum as soon as they are posted based on the guidelines and quality standards defined/listed by the forum. Thus, if a question meets the standard of the forum then it is classified as good else we classify it as bad. In this paper, we propose a method to address this problem of question classification by retrieving similar questions previously asked in the same forum, and then using the text from these previously asked similar questions to predict the quality of the current question. We empirically validate our proposed approach on the set of StackOverflow data, a massive CQA forum for programmers, comprising of about 8M questions. With the use of these additional text retrieved from similar questions, we are able to improve the question quality prediction accuracy by about 2.8% and improve the recall of negatively scored questions by about 4.2%. This improvement of 4.2% in recall would be helpful in automatically flagging questions as bad (unsuitable) for the forum and will speed up the moderation process thus saving time and human effort.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3854-7; POD:978-1-5090-2094-2","10.1145/2808797.2809318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403703","","Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Guidelines;Predictive models;Programming;Social network services;Software","pattern classification;question answering (information retrieval);text analysis","CQA forum;StackOverflow data;community question answering;question classification;question quality prediction;recall","","","","25","","","25-28 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a multiple replica based RDPC scheme based on matrix representation of data and provides public verifiability through which a Third party auditor (TPA) can verify the possession of data at the servers, which increases the flexibility of the protocol. Unlike the other RDPC schemes, this scheme uses a stratified sampling technique which delivers better results than probabilistic proofs of possession. This also provides a proof checking scheme by which we can check the possession of the data without retrieving the original file.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8788-7; POD:978-1-4799-8789-4","10.1109/ICIICT.2015.7396071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396071","RDPC scheme;Response Token;Retrievability;Schnorr signature","Cloud computing;Encryption;Probabilistic logic;Protocols;Servers","cloud computing;data integrity;data structures;information retrieval;security of data;storage management","TPA;cloud computing;distant remote cloud server;matrix data representation;multiple replica-based RDPC scheme;multiple replica-based remote data possession checking scheme;probabilistic possession proof;proof checking scheme;stratified sampling technique;third party auditor","","","","17","","","19-20 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Word embedding based retrieval model for similar cases recommendation","Yifei Zhao; Jing Wang; Feiyue Wang","The State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, CASIA, Beijing 100190, China","2015 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)","20160118","2015","","","2268","2272","Similar cases recommendation is more and more popular in the internet inquiry. There have been lots of cases which have been solved perfectly, and recommending them to similar inquiries can not only save the patients' waiting time, but also giving more good references. However, the inquiry platform cannot understand the diversity of description, i.e. the same meaning with different description. This may shield some cases with very high quality answers. In this paper, based on deep learning, we proposed a retrieval model combining word embedding with language models. We use word embedding to solve the problem of description diversity, and then recommend the similar cases for the inquiries. The experiments are based on the data from ask.39.net, and the results show that our methods outperform the state-of-art methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7189-6; POD:978-1-4673-7190-2; USB:978-1-4673-7188-9","10.1109/CAC.2015.7382881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7382881","case recommendation;data mining;internet inquiry;word embedding","Computational modeling;Estimation;Internet;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Medical services;Semantics","Internet;data mining;information retrieval;medical information systems","Internet inquiry;description diversity;patient waiting time;similar case recommendation;word embedding based retrieval model","","","","27","","","27-29 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Automatic detection of rumoured tweets and finding its origin","Sahana V P; A. R. Pias; R. Shastri; S.

These sites not only act as a platform for staying connected with friends and exchanging opinions and ideologies, but also help to share and disseminate information. Important events in the real world cause a huge flood of tweets on Twitter. During many such events, Twitter has been used to spread rumours and cause havoc and panic among the people, thus worsening the situation. In this project, we try to automatically detect the rumours spreading on Twitter and identify its source. Using some of the rumoured tweets posted during the London Riots in 2011 and some non-rumoured tweets, we trained a classifier. Our classifier correctly classifies the tweets with high accuracy. We show that, in rumour detection, the information propagated by the user becomes more important than the identity of the user by showing that tweet-based features play a much higher and significant role than user-based features. We propose an algorithm to find the origin of the rumoured tweets i.e. obtain the account information of the user who first started spreading rumours on Twitter.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7309-8; POD:978-1-4673-7310-4","10.1109/CoCoNet.2015.7411251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7411251","Twitter;origin detection;rumour detection;social networks","Classification algorithms;Computer science;Feature extraction;Fires;Media;Twitter","information dissemination;information retrieval;pattern classification;social networking (online)","London Riots;Twitter;automatic rumoured tweet detection;ideology exchange;information dissemination;opinion exchange;rumour spreading;social networking sites;tweet origin finding;tweet-based features","","","","23","","","16-19 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
