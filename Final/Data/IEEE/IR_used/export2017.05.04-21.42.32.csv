Our large-scale study measured the overlap of first page results (both non-sponsored and sponsored) across three major Web search engines - Google, Ask Jeeves and Yahoo - using a large number of randomly selected Dogpile.com queries submitted within a 24 hour - 36 hour period. We then compared the results to results retrieved for the same queries from the meta-search engine Dogpile.com. The percent of total results unique to only one of the three major Web search engines was 85%. 12% of total search results were found on two of the three Web search engines, and 3% of results were found across all three Web search engines. This small level of overlap reflects major differences in Web search engines retrieval and ranking results.

In an attempt to provide these, most systems assume a continuously connected and available underlying communication infrastructure. This however is not warranted in any real large-scale distributed system, and thus needs to be addressed. Continuous update systems that allow updating data by multiple writers have harder problems to overcome since the ordering of updates needs to be maintained independently of connectivity conditions. In this paper we propose a solution for maintaining a global view of the ordering even when severe connectivity disruptions take place, allowing the system to continue functioning while connectivity is disrupted and to recover from the disruption smoothly when connectivity is restored. To this end, we introduce and discuss three new concepts to the realm of P2P storage systems: 1) the maintenance of additional state information to detect and trace object updates during partitioning, 2) the usage of active decentralized object replication through shadow roots, and 3) the deployment of cryptographic technologies to allow for the recovery of private state information","","POD:0-7695-2537-7","10.1109/SISW.2005.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1628482","DHT;continuous update;peer-to-peer storage;persistency;versioning.","Availability;Cryptography;File systems;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Maintenance;Object detection;Peer to peer computing;Read only memory;Sun","cryptography;peer-to-peer computing;storage management;system recovery","DHT;active decentralized object replication;continuous update system;cryptographic technology;data persistence characteristics;object ordering;shared peer-to-peer storage system;system recovery","","1","","16","","","13-13 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This idea is explicitly used in the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (kNN), a popular classification method. In this paper, this idea is adopted in the development of a general methodology, neighborhood counting, for devising similarity functions. We turn our focus from neighbors to neighborhoods, a region in the data space covering the data point in question. To measure the similarity between two data points, we consider all neighborhoods that cover both data points. We propose to use the number of such neighborhoods as a measure of similarity. Neighborhood can be defined for different types of data in different ways. Here, we consider one definition of neighborhood for multivariate data and derive a formula for such similarity, called neighborhood counting measure or NCM. NCM was tested experimentally in the framework of kNN. Experiments show that NCM is generally comparable to VDM and its variants, the state-of-the-art distance functions for multivariate data, and, at the same time, is consistently better for relatively large k values. Additionally, NCM consistently outperforms HEOM (a mixture of Euclidean and Hamming distances), the ""standard"" and most widely used distance function for multivariate data. NCM has a computational complexity in the same order as the standard Euclidean distance function and NCM is task independent and works for numerical and categorical data in a conceptually uniform way. The neighborhood counting methodology is proven sound for multivariate data experimentally. We hope it works for other types of data.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624358","Pattern recognition;distance;machine learning;nearest neighbors;neighborhood counting measure.;similarity","Artificial intelligence;Computational complexity;Data mining;Euclidean distance;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Natural languages;Nearest neighbor searches;Testing","artificial intelligence;pattern classification","Euclidean distances;Hamming distances;artificial intelligence tasks;classification method;computational complexity;data mining;information retrieval;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;machine learning;multivariate data;natural language understanding;neighborhood counting measure;similarity functions;similarity measure;state-of-the-art distance functions","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","56","","29","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hidden Markov models have often been used for handwriting recognition. Conditional random fields (CRF's) allow for more general dependencies and we investigate their use. We believe that this is the first attempt at apply CRF's for handwriting recognition. We show that on the whole word recognition task, the CRF performs better than a HMM on a publicly available standard dataset of 20 pages of George Washington's manuscripts. The scale space for the whole word recognition task is large - almost 1200 states. To make CRF computation tractable we use beam search to make inference more efficient using three different approaches. Better improvement can be obtained using the HMM by directly smoothing the discrete features using the collection frequencies.

Exact solutions can be time consuming and difficult to implement given the distributed and dynamic nature of peer-to-peer databases. In this paper we present novel sampling-based techniques for approximate answering of ad-hoc aggregation queries in such databases. Computing a high-quality random sample of the database efficiently in the P2P environment is complicated due to several factors ― the data is distributed (usually in uneven quantities) across many peers, within each peer the data is often highly correlated, and moreover, even collecting a random sample of the peers is difficult to accomplish. To counter these problems, we have developed an adaptive two-phase sampling approach, based on random walks of the P2P graph as well as block-level sampling techniques.

Because the radio waves emitted from RFID reader are invisible, it's really hard to detect who reads a tag attached to or incorporated into products owned by a person.

In this paper, the spatio-temporal information of a video object, such as the velocity, location and orientation of a video object, is represented by an ST-string. Since the user may not be interested in all spatio-temporal information, the user query can be represented by a QST-string which contains some spatio-temporal information only, such as the velocity and orientation of a video object. Therefore, the video retrieval problem can be transformed into the problem of approximately matching a QST-string with ST-strings. A general solution is proposed in this paper, which includes a similarity measure, an index structure and the corresponding matching methodology.

While a solution that associates a certificate with each block of data is conceptually simple, researchers have traditionally claimed that the cost of creating and maintaining certificates is too great. In this paper, we demonstrate that systems can, in fact, efficiently map data to its owner in a secure and non-repudiable fashion. To reduce the cost of creating and maintaining certificates, we extend the traditional content-addressable interface to allow the aggregation of many small data blocks into larger containers.

RDF and RDF schema are the W3C standard models for describing metadata and ontology. Therefore, storing and querying RDF and RDF schema is one of major tasks in applications on the semantic Web. Many existing studies are mainly tailored to RDF triple statements without considering RDF schema. And most studies are focused on querying over simple triple statements and pass over various query forms such as keyword-based query and path-based query. In this paper, we propose two indexing techniques considering both RDF and RDF schema. First, we present a path index for processing structure-based query of RDF and RDF schema. Path index stores all path information in graph models of RDF and RDF schema and supports hierarchical relationships between classes or properties. Second, we describe a keyword index for processing keyword-based query. Keyword index stores all resources that contain indirectly or directly a certain keyword in RDF.

In particular, it is intended for representing metadata about Web resources. RDF is being used in numerous application areas, including Life Sciences, Digital Libraries, and Intelligence. The RDF data structure is a directed graph or network. Current solutions to managing RDF data utilize flat relational tables for database storage. This paper presents an alternative approach to managing RDF data in the database. We introduce a new object type for storing RDF data. The object type is built on top of the Oracle Spatial Network Data Model (NDM), which is Oracles network solution in the database. This exposes the NDM functionality to RDF data, allowing RDF data to be managed as objects and analyzed as networks. Reification, a means of providing metadata for the RDF data, puts a strain on storage. We present a streamlined approach to representing reified RDF data for faster retrievals. An RDF object type and reification in the database provide the basic infrastructure for effective metadata management.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2570-9","10.1109/ICDE.2006.126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1617461","","Capacitive sensors;Data models;Data structures;Information retrieval;Relational databases;Resource description framework;Software libraries;Spatial databases;Web pages;Web sites","","","","3","2","26","","","03-07 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from the existing database modeling methods, our approach carries a stochastic and dynamic process in both search and similarity calculation.

Within this framework, one can study the performance of different aggregation methods. The individual rankers, which are the inputs to the rank aggregation algorithm, are statistical perturbations of the ground truth ranker. With rigorous experimental evaluation, we study how noise level and the misinformation of the rankers affect the performance of the aggregate ranker. We introduce and study a novel Kendalltau rank aggregator and a simple aggregator called PrOpt, which we compare to some other well known rank aggregation algorithms such as average, median and Markov chain aggregators.

Reasons for this inexactness are varying measuring techniques or environmental circumstances. Since these circumstances are not necessarily the same when determining the features for different individuals, the exactness might strongly vary between the individuals as well as between the features. To identify individuals, similarity search on feature vectors is applicable, but even the use of adaptable distance measures is not capable to handle objects having an individual level of exactness. Therefore, we develop a comprehensive probabilistic theory in which uncertain observations are modeled by probabilistic feature vectors (pfv), i.e. feature vectors where the conventional feature values are replaced by Gaussian probability distribution functions. Each feature value of each object is complemented by a variance value indicating its uncertainty. We define two types of identification queries, k-mostlikely identification and threshold identification. For efficient query processing, we propose a novel index structure, the Gauss-tree. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that pfv stored in a Gauss-tree significantly improve the result quality compared to traditional feature vectors. Additionally, we show that the Gauss-tree significantly speeds up query times compared to competitive methods.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2570-9","10.1109/ICDE.2006.159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1617377","","Biometrics;Face recognition;Fingerprint recognition;Gaussian processes;Informatics;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Query processing;Spatial databases;Uncertainty","","","","31","","14","","","03-07 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a way to use layout information for document image retrieval instead. A new class of distance measures is introduced for documents with Manhattan layouts, based on a two-step procedure: First, the distances between the blocks of two layouts are calculated. Then, the blocks of one layout are assigned to the blocks of the other layout in a matching step. Different block distances and matching methods are compared and evaluated using the publicly available MARG database. On this dataset, the layout type can be determined successfully in 92.6% of the cases using the best distance measure in a nearest neighbor classifier.

How to access and retrieve the XML data is crucial to these applications. There are two standard ways for accessing and manipulating XML data, the Simple API for XML (SAX) and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, when an application needs to traverse through XML data, it is not easy to retrieve the required data with these two standard ways. XML data is impossible to be retrieved back and forth by SAX, and the graph-oriented DOM notation is not easy to work with. With such limitation, the W3C supervises the development of three important languages: XPath [3], XQuery and XSLT for exploring and querying XML. Among these three languages, XPath is the key and cornerstone language for the other two. XPath defines expressions for traversing an XML document and specifies the set of nodes (XPath 1.0) or the sequence of nodes (XPath 2.0) in the XML document.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2570-9","10.1109/ICDE.2006.177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1617538","","Data engineering;Data visualization;Debugging;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Information technology;Navigation;Polynomials;XML","","","","1","","3","","","03-07 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when the data set is large, naively scanning the entire data set to find the top matches is not scalable. In this work, we propose a kernel indexing strategy to substantially prune the search space and, thus, improve the performance of top-k queries. Our kernel indexer (KDX) takes advantage of the underlying geometric properties and quickly converges on an approximate set of top-k instances of interest. More importantly, once the kernel (e.g., Gaussian kernel) has been selected and the indexer has been constructed, the indexer can work with different kernel-parameter settings (e.g., gamma and sigma) without performance compromise. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies on a wide variety of data sets, we demonstrate KDX to be very effective.

The time complexity of computing interaction force is independent of the complexity of the model. This feature is advantageous for time-critical applications.

Examples of such applications range from optimizing query access plans in internet-scale databases, to evaluating the significance (rank/score) of various data items in information retrieval applications. The key constraints that any acceptable solution must satisfy are: (i) efficiency: the number of nodes that need be contacted for counting purposes must be small in order to enjoy small latency and bandwidth requirements; (ii) scalability, seemingly contradicting the efficiency goal: arbitrarily large numbers of nodes nay need to add elements to a (multi-) set, which dictates the need for a highly distributed solution, avoiding server-based scalability, bottleneck, and availability problems; (iii) access and storage load balancing: counting and related overhead chores should be distributed fairly to the nodes of the network; (iv) accuracy: tunable, robust (in the presence of dynamics and failures) and highly accurate cardinality estimation; (v) simplicity and ease of integration: special, solution-specific indexing structures should be avoided. In this paper, first we contribute a highly-distributed, scalable, efficient, and accurate (multi-) set cardinality estimator.

Formally, given a relation with a large number (e.g.,ge 10) of attributes, a query aims at finding the skyline in an arbitrary subspace with a low dimensionality (e.g., 2). The existing algorithms do not support subspace skyline retrieval efficiently because they (i) require scanning the entire database at least once, or (ii) are optimized for one particular subspace but incur significant overhead for other subspaces.

We propose and implement the obscene video classification system using two visual features to determine a video's lewdness with very excellent performance. In our approach, the two features are first built for each video and a final decision function is made to classify an obscene video. One of the visual features is a single frame based decision variable and the other is a group frame based decision variable. Then the final decision function is developed to optimize high classification performance using the variables by the discriminant analysis.

The emphasis of this article is to determine the extent to which the SOM possesses the ability to analyze such data, successfully uncovering the stylistic differences among authors in an unsupervised manner. To that end, a variety of feature vectors are studied, each of which either 1) comprises a single category of linguistic features or 2) spans several different categories of linguistic features, in order to determine the effectiveness of each feature category. It is shown that the highest accuracy is achieved when using a vector covering multiple linguistic categories.

Image labeling, however, is a time-consuming task and users are often unwilling to label too many images during the feedback process. This gives rise to the small sample problem where learning from a small number of training samples restricts the retrieval performance. To address this problem, we propose a technique based on the concept of pseudo-labeling in order to enlarge the training data set. As the name implies, a pseudo-labeled image is an image not labeled explicitly by the users, but estimated using a fuzzy rule. Therefore, it contains a certain degree of uncertainty or fuzziness in its class information. Fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM), an extended version of SVM, takes into account the fuzzy nature of some training samples during its training. In order to exploit the advantages of pseudo-labeling, active learning and the structure of FSVM, we develop a unified framework called pseudo-label fuzzy support vector machine (PLFSVM) to perform content-based image retrieval.

Elements are cross compared using various heuristics (e.g., name, data-type, and structure similarity). Seen from a broader perspective, the schema matching problem is a combinatorial problem with an exponential complexity. This makes the naive matching algorithms for large schemas prohibitively inefficient. In this paper we propose a clustering based technique for improving the efficiency of large scale schema matching. The technique inserts clustering as an intermediate step into existing schema matching algorithms. Clustering partitions schemas and reduces the overall matching load, and creates a possibility to trade between the efficiency and effectiveness. The technique can be used in addition to other optimization techniques.

A variety of predicates have been utilized to quantify approximate match in such operations and some have been embedded in a declarative data cleaning framework. These techniques return pairs of tuples from both relations, tagged with a score, signifying the degree of similarity between the tuples in the pair according to the specific approximate match predicate. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating various parameters on the output of declarative approximate join algorithms for planning purposes. Such algorithms are highly time consuming, so precise knowledge of the result size as well as its score distribution is a pressing concern. This knowledge aids decisions as to which operations are more promising for identifying highly similar tuples, which is a key operation for data cleaning. We propose solution strategies that fully comply with a declarative framework and analytically reason about the quality of the estimates we obtain as well as the performance of our strategies. We present the results of a detailed performance evaluation of all strategies proposed.

In addition to fast searching using this compact descriptor, we further improve retrieval time by applying pruning technique, which looks for the candidate images similar to the query image from the database and ignore the rest that are not likely to the query image. The descriptors of the candidate images are then matched with that of the query. The most similar images will be retrieved and ordered according to their distance to the query.

It facilitates to start decompression from any place in the compressed file, not necessarily from first. If any byte changed during transmission, the remaining data can be retrieved safely. In this paper, a try has been made to develop few algorithms for random access text compression based on the byte pair encoding scheme (Gage, 1997). The BPE algorithm relies on the fact that ASCII character set uses only codes from 0 through 127. That frees up codes from 128 through 255 for use as pair codes. Pair code is a byte, used to replace the most frequently appearing pair of bytes in the text file. Five algorithms are developed based on this byte pair encoding scheme.

In this paper, we introduce a new approach called SaveRF (Save random accesses in Relevance Feedback) for iterative relevance feedback search. SaveRF predicts the potential candidates for the next iteration and maintains this small set for efficient sequential scan. By doing so, repeated candidate accesses can be saved, hence reducing the number of random accesses. In addition, efficient scan on the overlap before the search starts also tightens the search space with smaller pruning radius. We implemented SaveRF and our experimental study on real life data sets show that it can reduce the I/O cost significantly.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2570-9","10.1109/ICDE.2006.132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1617478","","Computer science;Costs;Feedback loop;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Iterative methods;Linear regression;Smoothing methods","","","","1","","4","","","03-07 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, current holistic approaches still suffer from the following limitations: a). They are sensitive to noisy data; b). While different types of information about attributes (e.g. attribute names, text descriptions, domain values) have been used, it remains an issue to effectively merge these types of information. In this paper, we propose a re-sampling method for handling noisy data across multiple web interfaces in the same domain.

Since a WSN is often deployed unattended in areas where replacements of failed sensors are difficult, energy conservation is of primary concern. While the use of redundancy is desirable in terms of satisfying user queries to cope with sensor faults, it may adversely shorten the lifetime of the WSN, as more sensor nodes will have to be used to answer queries, causing the energy of the system to drain quickly. In this paper, we analyze the effect of redundancy on the mean time to failure (MTTF) of a WSN in terms of the number of queries the system is able to answer correctly before it fails due to either sensor faults or energy depletion. In particular, we analyze their effect of redundancy on the MTTF of cluster-structured WSN for energy conservations. We show that a tradeoff exists between redundancy and MTTF. Furthermore, an optimal redundancy level exists such that the MTTF of the system is maximized.","1550-445X;1550445X","POD:0-7695-2466-4","10.1109/AINA.2006.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1620407","","Biomedical monitoring;Condition monitoring;Energy conservation;Energy consumption;Hardware;Head;Information retrieval;Redundancy;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","query processing;redundancy;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","MTTF;data retrieval;data sensing;energy conservation;mean time to failure;query-based WSN;redundancy;wireless sensor network","","5","","14","","","18-20 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The investigated patterns are inherently group-based (defined by the individual activities of meeting participants, and their interplay), and multimodal (as captured by cameras and microphones). By defining a proper set of individual actions, group actions can be modeled as a two-layer process, one that models basic individual activities from low-level audio-visual (AV) features,and another one that models the interactions. We propose a two-layer hidden Markov model (HMM) framework that implements such concept in a principled manner, and that has advantages over previous works. First, by decomposing the problem hierarchically, learning is performed on low-dimensional observation spaces, which results in simpler models. Second, our framework is easier to interpret, as both individual and group actions have a clear meaning, and thus easier to improve. Third, different HMMs can be used in each layer, to better reflect the nature of each subproblem. Our framework is general and extensible, and we illustrate it with a set of eight group actions, using a public 5-hour meeting corpus. Experiments and comparison with a single-layer HMM baseline system show its validity.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2006.870735","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632036","Human interaction recognition;multimodal processing and multimedia applications;statistical models","Cameras;Computer vision;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Microphones;Pattern recognition;Speech analysis;Speech processing","hidden Markov models;human computer interaction;speech processing;speech recognition","HMM;human interaction pattern sequence recognition;low-level audio-visual features;multimodal processing;public 5-hour meeting corpus;two-layer hidden Markov model framework","","75","","43","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This problem is challenging due to the presence of clutter in the image, ambiguities in image observation, unknown human image boundary, and high-dimensional state space due to the complex articulated structure of the human body. Human pose estimation can be made more robust by integrating the detection of body components such as face and limbs, with the highly constrained structure of the articulated body. In this paper, a data-driven approach based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (DD-MCMC) is used, where component detection results generate state proposals for 3D pose estimation. To translate these observations into pose hypotheses, we introduce the use of ""proposal maps,"" an efficient way of consolidating the evidence and generating 3D pose candidates during the MCMC search. Experimental results on a set of test images show that the method is able to estimate the human pose in static images of real scenes.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624355","Three-dimensional human pose estimation from static images;body parts detector;data driven Markov chain Monte Carlo;generative models.","Biological system modeling;Content based retrieval;Face detection;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Monte Carlo methods;Robustness;State-space methods","Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;image recognition;image retrieval;visual databases","Markov chain Monte Carlo;body component detection;complex articulated structure;data-driven approach;high-dimensional state space;highly constrained structure;human 3D pose estimation;image clutter;image database query;image database retrieval;image observation;image understanding applications;model-based approach;pose hypotheses;semantic content extraction;static images;unknown human image boundary","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Joints;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Posture;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","54","","36","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We apply the similarity measure for two tasks: retrieval and summarization. In video retrieval, a hierarchical retrieval framework is constructed based on MM and OM. The validity of the framework is theoretically proved and empirically verified on a video database of 21 h.

Compression can alleviate this bottleneck only if encoding and decoding speeds significantly exceed RAID I/O bandwidth. For this purpose, we propose three new versatile compression schemes (PDICT, PFOR, and PFOR-DELTA) that are specifically designed to extract maximum IPC from modern CPUs. We compare these algorithms with compression techniques used in (commercial) database and information retrieval systems. Our experiments on the MonetDB/X100 database system, using both DSM and PAX disk storage, show that these techniques strongly accelerate TPC-H performance to the point that the I/O bottleneck is eliminated.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2570-9","10.1109/ICDE.2006.150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1617427","","Bandwidth;Costs;Data analysis;Data mining;Databases;Encoding;Hardware;Information retrieval;Query processing;Throughput","","","","46","4","20","","","03-07 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Measurement principles, methods for cloud detection, and radiative transfer models for retrieving cloud properties are discussed. The 240-GHz data from high-tangent heights are used to retrieve ice water content at pressures <215 hPa, and the 118-, 190-, 240-, and 640-GHz radiances from low-tangent heights are used to retrieve ice water paths with different penetration depths. Some early Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) results are highlighted, and the observed cloud signatures are consistent with the expectation from model simulations, in general. The simultaneous measurements from MLS 240 and 640 GHz radiometers contain useful information on particle sizes. There are significant cloud-induced radiances at 2.5 THz, despite strong attenuation from the atmosphere. Cloud-scattering signatures are polarized at 122 GHz, but the polarization differences are typically less than 10% of the total cloud-induced radiance.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.869994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624596","Ice water content (IWC);limb sounding;microwave;polarization;satellite;upper-tropospheric clouds","Atmospheric modeling;Clouds;Content based retrieval;Earth Observing System;Frequency measurement;Ice;Information retrieval;Microwave measurements;Multilevel systems;Polarization","aerospace instrumentation;artificial satellites;atmospheric measuring apparatus;atmospheric optics;clouds;ice;microwave measurement;radiative transfer;troposphere","118 GHz;190 GHz;2.5 THz;240 GHz;640 GHz;EOS MLS;Earth Observing System;Microwave Limb Sounder;NASA Aura satellite;cloud ice measurement;cloud-scattering signature;cloudy-sky radiative transfer model;ice water content;microwave limb sounding;microwave polarization;upper tropospheric clouds","","34","","31","","","May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
