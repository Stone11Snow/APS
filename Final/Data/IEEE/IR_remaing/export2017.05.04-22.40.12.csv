Information retrieval techniques such as topic detection and tracking are able to organize news stories as events, in a flat hierarchical structure, within a topic. However, they are incapable of presenting the complex evolution relationships between the events. We are interested to learn not only what the major events are but also how they develop within the topic. It is beneficial to identify the seminal events, the intermediary and ending events, and the evolution of these events. In this paper, we propose to utilize the event timestamp, event content similarity, temporal proximity, and document distributional proximity to model the event evolution relationships between events in an incident. An event evolution graph is constructed to present the underlying structure of events for efficient browsing and extracting of information. Case study and experiments are presented to illustrate and show the performance of our proposed technique. It is found that our proposed technique outperforms the baseline technique and other comparable techniques in previous work.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2015885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4909011","Event evolution;event evolution graph;graph pruning;topic detection and tracking (TDT)","","Internet;graph theory;information retrieval;text analysis","Internet;document distributional proximity;event content similarity;event evolution graph;event timestamp;information retrieval technique;news stories;temporal proximity;topic detection;topic tracking","","36","","27","","20090505","July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this purpose we have designed and implemented a system called AgentMat. This system is designed for efficient extraction of large amount of data from the Web pages. AgentMat processing is based on an XML-based language describing the given extraction task in a declarative way. The task description consists of system components, which connected together are able to perform the desired functionality on a general Web page. Thanks to this scraping system the raw contents from the irregularly updated and unstructured Web pages can be kept categorized and accessed together with the semantic metadata.

The peculiar characteristics of Arabic handwriting have added an extra challenging dimension in developing such systems. This paper presents a novel holistic technique for segmenting and classifying HAH manuscripts. The classification of HAH manuscripts is performed in several steps. First, the HAH manuscript's image is segmented into words, and then each word is segmented into its connected parts. Due to the existing overlap between the adjacent connected parts of a single word, we developed a stretching algorithm to increase the gap between them and thus improve their segmentation. Second, several structural and statistical features, which are devised for Arabic text, are extracted from these connected parts and then combined to represent a word with one consolidated feature vector. Finally, a neural network is used to learn and classify the input vectors into word classes. The extraction of structural and statistical features from the individual connected parts, as compared to the extraction of these features from the whole word, improved the performance of the system significantly.","2151-1349;21511349","POD:978-1-4244-2864-9","10.1109/RCIS.2009.5089285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089285","Data mining of Arabic documents;Feature extraction of Arabic text;Historical Arabic handwriting;Segmentation of Historical Arabic handwritten documents;Word classification","Application software;Buildings;Error correction;Laboratories;Mobile agents;Multiagent systems;Scattering;Software design;Software testing;System testing","document image processing;image segmentation;information retrieval;natural language processing;neural nets;text analysis","automatic searching;historical Arabic handwritten documents;historical Arabic handwritten manuscripts;indexing;neural network;retrieval;word classification;word segmentation;word stretching","","0","","32","","","22-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The PathMiner system supports network-based submission of queries and can automatically locate and retrieve digitized pathology specimens along with correlated molecular studies of cases from ldquoground-truthrdquo databases that exhibit spectral and spatial profiles consistent with a given query image. The statistically most probable diagnosis is provided to the individual who is seeking decision support. To test the system under real-case scenarios, a pipeline infrastructure was developed and a network-based test laboratory was established at strategic sites at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, and Rutgers University. The average five-class classification accuracy of the system was 93.18% based on a tenfold cross validation on a close dataset containing 3691 imaged specimens. We also conducted prospective performance studies with the PathMiner system in real applications in which the specimens exhibited large variations in staining characters compared with the training data. The average five-class classification accuracy in this open-set experiment was 87.22%.

This strategy involves peer selection and piece selection methods. The existing peer selection method uses hop counts between peers. However, this method has the problem of being unable to reflect other network traffic conditions. Therefore, we use not only hop counts but also network status as a parameter.

The challenge between ldquoadvaRSSrdquo and a usual crawler is the fact that the news is produced in a random order any time of the day and thus the freshness of the offline collection can be measured even in minutes. This means that the system has to be updated with news every single time they occur. In order to achieve this we utilize the communication channels that exist on the modern architecture of the WWW and more specifically in almost every modern news portal.

Aiming at the former problem, this paper proposes to utilize ontology to organize the domain knowledge and provide formal, explicit and conceptual annotation. Meanwhile, a dual-level semi-automatic annotation approach is also proposed to resolve the latter problem. The rough annotation layer provides preliminary annotation by automatically extracting some semantic concepts from photo titles/texts, time concepts from EXIF metadata, and photo classification concepts from the result of face detection algorithms. The accurate annotation layer provides more detailed annotation by allowing users to modify, delete and add the annotation information freely. An ontology based photo management system OntoAlbum is implemented in this paper.

As a major type of social media in Web 2.0, Web forums facilitate intensive interactions among participants. International Jihadist groups often use Web forums to promote violence and distribute propaganda materials. These Dark Web forums are heterogeneous and widely distributed. Therefore, how to access and analyze the forum messages and interactions among participants is becoming an issue. This paper presents a general framework for Web forum data integration. Specifically, a Web-based knowledge portal, the Dark Web Forums Portal, is built based on the framework.

Most of the current social network applications have been designed for high-end mobile devices, and they rely upon features such as GPS, capabilities of the World Wide Web, and rich media support. However, a significant fraction of mobile user base, especially in the developing world, own low-end devices that are only capable of voice and short text messages (SMS). In this context, a natural question is whether one can design meaningful social network-based applications that can work well with these simple devices, and if so, what the real challenges are. Towards answering these questions, this paper presents a social network-based recommender system that has been explicitly designed to work even with devices that just support phone calls and SMS. Our design of the social network based recommender system incorporates three features that complement each other to derive highly targeted ads. First, we analyze information such as customer's address books to estimate the level of social affinity among various users. This social affinity information is used to identify the recommendations to be sent to an individual user. Second, we combine the social affinity information with the spatio-temporal context of users and historical responses of the user to further refine the set of recommendations and to decide when a recommendation would be sent. Third, social affinity computation and spatio-temporal contextual association are continuously tuned through user feedback. We outline the challenges in building such a system, and outline approaches to deal with such challenges.","1551-6245;15516245","POD:978-1-4244-4153-2","10.1109/MDM.2009.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088954","","Business;Conference management;Context-aware services;Global Positioning System;Laboratories;Middleware;Mobile handsets;Recommender systems;Social network services;Spatiotemporal phenomena","Internet;information retrieval;mobile computing;mobile handsets;social networking (online);ubiquitous computing","GPS;World Wide Web;context-aware system;low-end mobile devices;mobile user base;mobile-enabled social networks applications;short text messages;social affinity information;social recommender system;spatio-temporal contextual association","","14","2","17","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When it is used a large amount of semantics of data may be lost during the transformation from the conceptual model to a logical model. As a consequence exchanging/integrating various databases or generating user interfaces for data access become difficult. Ontologies seem an interesting solution to solve these problems, since they allow making explicit the semantics of data. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for designing database applications, and then, for representing explicitly the semantics of data within the database. It consists in extending the ANSI/SPARC architecture with the ontological level. Note that this extension may also be added to existing applications designed according to the ANSI/SPARC architecture, since it preserves an upward compatibility.","","POD:978-1-4244-3467-1","10.1109/DBKDA.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071824","Database;MOF;Meta-modeling;Metadata;OBDB;Ontology;Ontology-Based Databases","Data mining;Data models;Database systems;Design methodology;Joining processes;Memory;Ontologies;Process design;Relational databases;User interfaces","database management systems;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);software architecture;user interfaces","ANSI-SPARC architecture;data access;database applications;ontology-based approach;user interfaces","","3","","18","","","1-6 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Center, IBM, San Jose, CA","2009 Data Compression Conference","20090526","2009","","","442","442","Data deduplication is a popular dictionary based compression method in storage archival and backup. The deduplication efficiency improves for smaller chunk sizes, however the files become highly fragmented requiring many disk accesses during reconstruction or chattiness in a client-server architecture. Within the sequence of chunks that an object (file) is decomposed into, sub-sequences of adjacent chunks tend to repeat. We exploit this insight to optimize the chunk sizes by joining repeated sub-sequences of small chunks into new super chunks with the constraint to achieve practically the same matching performance. We employ suffix arrays to find these repeating sub-sequences and to determine a new encoding that covers the original sequence. With super chunks we significantly reduce fragmentation, improving reconstruction time and the overall deduplication ratio by lowering the amount of metadata. As a result, fewer chunks are used to represent a file, reducing the number of disk accesses needed to reconstruct the file and requiring fewer entries in the chunk dictionary and fewer hashes to encode a file. To encode a sequence of chunks we proved two facts: (1) any subsequence that repeats is part of some super chunk (su- permaximal in Figure 1) - therefore the dictionary contains just supermaximals and non-repeats, and (2) maximals are the only repeats not covered (overlapped) by the containing supermaximals - so once we discover the maximals with the suffix array, and encode them, there is no need for maintaining auxiliary data structures like bit masks, to guarantee the coverage (encoding) of the entire object. Our experimental evaluation (Figure 2) yields a reduction in fragmentation between 89%-97% and a reduction of dictionary metadata (number of entries) between 80%-97%, without increasing the total amount of storage required for unique chunks.","1068-0314;10680314","POD:978-0-7695-3592-0","10.1109/DCC.2009.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976496","Data deduplication;File chunking;Information archiving;Storage backup","Constraint optimization;Data compression;Data structures;Dictionaries;Encoding;Optimization methods;Samarium","client-server systems;data compression;data structures;dictionaries;information retrieval systems;optimisation","auxiliary data structures;block size optimization;client-server architecture;data deduplication;deduplication systems;dictionary based compression method;disk accesses;storage archival","","3","3","","","","16-18 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that grid and cloud technology can provide the crucial technology for building scalable preservation systems. In this paper, we present recent developments on a job submission service that is based on standard grid mechanisms and capable of providing a large cluster of virtual machines. The service allows clients to specify and execute preservation tools on large data sets based on dynamically generated job descriptors. This approach allows us to utilize a cloud infrastructure that is based on platform virtualization as a scaling environment for the execution of preservation workflows.

The light-weight communication style of simple type-and-send-in-real-time is the main reason for online chatting (or instant messages) being favorable. However, similar with other sophisticated social networks, online chatting potentially faces the problem of being utilized by perpetrators or even pedophiles to conduct initial approach to innocent online users, who are in many situations children, which may lead to a dangerous crime. Therefore, in some cases, the investigation of victim's online chatting history may play an important role in identifying potential suspects. In this paper we study the aforementioned problem from the technical perspective and seek to conduct systematic approaches to retrieve user online chatting records from general Internet traces. Specifically, we conduct a preliminary study on identifying different types of Google Talk, one of the most popular online chatting software, by using Wireshark (or Ethereal). We describe in details the pattern of each type of online chat messages, and present the corresponding process of identifying the messages. Our experiments show that unencrypted Google Talk chat messages can be easily identified. This study is an initiation on conducting research to provide simple tools for facilitating online message investigations in the future.","","POD:978-1-4244-4172-3","10.1109/ISI.2009.5137327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137327","","Communication networks;Computer science;Costs;Educational institutions;History;IP networks;Internet telephony;Routing;Social network services;Web and internet services","Internet telephony;cryptography;electronic messaging;information retrieval;social networking (online)","Ethereal chatting software;Facebook;Internet trace;VoIP service;Wireshark chatting software;instant messaging;mySpace;online chatting records retrieval;online social networking;unencrypted Google Talk packet identification","","0","","12","","","8-11 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Impervious surface which is a major component of V-I-S model is one of the important factors affecting urban ecological environment and residential quality. In this paper, taking Land sat TM image as data source, the distribution information of impervious surface of Changchun, China was obtained by spectral unmixing analysis. In the process of study, it was discovered that the spectra of different impervious surfaces had great differences, and the shade and shadow also significantly influenced estimation accuracy. In order to solve these problems, the method of spectrum brightness normalization was utilized. As a result, the differences within impervious surfaces had decreased obviously, while the differences between impervious surface and other land cover types had increased. It is more convenient to extract the impervious surface information. Then the impervious surface fraction image together with vegetation and soil fraction image was gained by using linear spectral unmixing analysis. Accuracy validation shows that the result is reasonable. Finally, post analysis was carried out on the basis of zonal statistics method and the potential residential areas data got from urban master planning map of Changchun (1996-2020).","","POD:978-0-7695-3563-0","10.1109/ETTandGRS.2008.248","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5070276","MNF transformation;Normalization;impervious surface;pixel unmixing;residential quality","Biological system modeling;Brightness;Data mining;Image analysis;Information analysis;Land surface;Soil;Spectral analysis;Statistical analysis;Vegetation mapping","image processing;information retrieval;town and country planning;vegetation mapping","Landsat TM image;V-I-S model;normalized image;residential quality;spectral mixture analysis;surface information extraction;urban ecological environment;urban master planning map;urban surface composition;vegetation-impervious surface-soil","","0","","8","","","21-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A set of computationally efficient algorithms that can be applied to any block matching algorithm and is applied to the DS as a study case achieves higher complexity reduction than DS algorithm without further relative PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) degradation compared to full search (FS). First, dynamic internal stop search (DISS) algorithm is used to reduce the internal redundant SAD (sum of absolute difference) operations between the current and the candidate blocks using an accurate dynamic threshold. Second, a dynamic external stop search (DESS) greatly reduces the unnecessary operations by skipping all the irrelevant blocks in the search area. In addition, early search termination and adaptive pattern selections techniques are applied to the proposed MDS as initialization steps to achieve even higher complexity reduction. The accuracy of the proposed model threshold equations guarantee not to fall into a local minima. Experiments show that the proposed MDS algorithm reduces the computations greatly up to 99% and 20% compared with the conventional FS algorithm and DS respectively with no significant degradation in both the PSNR and the bit-rate.","0271-4302;02714302","POD:978-1-4244-3827-3","10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5118483","Block Matching;Diamond Search;Fast Motion Estimation;H.264/AVC","Automatic voltage control;Computational complexity;Degradation;Equations;Motion estimation;PSNR;Portable computers;Very large scale integration;Video codecs;Video sequences","computational complexity;image matching;information retrieval;motion estimation;video coding","H.264-AVC;adaptive pattern selections techniques;block matching algorithm;complexity reduction;dynamic external stop search;dynamic internal stop search algorithm;early search termination;fast block motion estimation;modified diamond search;sum of absolute difference","","4","","11","","","24-27 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once the content linking device finds documents linked to a discussion about a similar subject in a previous meeting, it assumes they may be relevant for the current discussion as well. We believe that the way these documents are offered to the meeting participants is equally important as the way they are found. We developed a projection based mixed reality user interface that lets the documents appear on the table tops in front of the meeting participants. They can hand them over to others or bring them onto the shared projection screen easily if they consider them relevant for others as well. Yet, irrelevant documents do not draw too much attention from the discussion.

We explore how useful mirror information can be extracted via a theory-driven approach and a range of clustering and sequential pattern mining. The context is a senior software development project where students use the collaboration tool TRAC. We extract patterns distinguishing the better from the weaker groups and get insights in the success factors. The results point to the importance of leadership and group interaction, and give promising indications if they are occurring. Patterns indicating good individual practices were also identified.

To this end, it is essential to understand individual customer preferences for products. In this paper, we present a method for identifying customer preferences and recommending the most appropriate product. The identification and recommendation of such products are all based on the use of customer's real-time web usage behavior, including activities such as viewing, basket placement, and purchasing of products. Therefore, in this approach, we do not force a customer to explicitly express his or her preference information for particular products but rather capture his or her preferences from data that result from such activities. Information on the web usage behavior for the products determines the ordinal relationships among the products, which express that certain product is preferred to other products across the multiple aspects. The ordinal relationships among the products and the multiple aspects of products lead to the consideration of a multiple-criteria decision-making approach. Thus, the problem eventually results in the identification of weights attached to the multiple criteria in the multidimensional preference space constructed by the ordinal relationships among the products. The derived weights are then used for the prioritization of products that are not included in the navigation behavior due to factors such as time pressure, cognitive burden, and the like.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2018636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4915763","Electronic commerce;fuzzy linguistic quantifier;implicit feedback;multicriteria decision making (MCDM);personalized recommendations","","Internet;customer satisfaction;decision making;electronic commerce;feedback;information retrieval","World Wide Web;customer preferences;electronic commerce;implicit feedback;multicriteria decision approach;multiple-criteria decision-making;navigation behavior","","6","","32","","20090512","July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, it is difficult, if not impossible, for unstructured P2P search protocols to effectively locate items with guaranteed recall rate. Second, existing schemes to improve search successful rate often rely on replicating a large number of item replicas across the wide area network, incurring a large amount of communication and storage cost. In this paper we propose BloomCast, an efficient and effective full-text retrieval scheme, in unstructured P2P networks. BloomCast is effective because it guarantees perfect recall rate with high probability. It is efficient because the overall communication cost of full-text search is reduced below a formal bound. Furthermore, by casting Bloom Filters instead of the raw documents across the network, BloomCast significantly reduces the communication cost and storage cost for replication. We demonstrate the power of BloomCast design through both mathematical proof and comprehensive simulations. Results show that BloomCast outperforms existing schemes in terms of both recall rate and communication cost.","","POD:978-1-4244-3935-5","10.1109/CCGRID.2009.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071854","DHT;Peer-to-Peer;Search;Unstructured Overlay","Casting;Costs;Filters;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Wide area networks","information retrieval;peer-to-peer computing","BloomCast;full-text retrieval;guaranteed recall;peer-to-peer networks","","1","","32","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we define data freshness metrics and propose an adaptive algorithm for the synchronization of the harvester with the repositories. The algorithm is based on meeting a desired level of freshness while incurring the minimum overhead on the harvester.

The system presented in this paper is a following work from our previous works in. This monitoring system is currently being used on real traffic environment in Thailand. The results in this paper confirm the validity of the proposed systems in the real-time traffic monitoring system. In the proposed system, background is modeled by using edge information and this model is used for extracting foreground moving objects. The advantage of using edge information to model the background is that it is more robust to the lighting variation. Moreover, it requires less computing resources than intensity based background model, thus; it is suitable for real-time application. The extracted moving objects are then tracked by using Lukas-Kanade (Pyramid) optical flow algorithm. Only the successfully tracked vehicle will be considered for retrieving traffic information. We embedded all the algorithms into a small module, comprising of hardware such as computer and network equipments. These modules are installed at various places along Northern to Southern major roads in Thailand. These modules are running continuously for a year to report traffic data to the server. These data is also released to the public through the website http://traffic.thai.net. The experimental results show that the traffic characteristic obtained from the proposed system is similar to the actual road traffic. It indicates that the system can be used to monitor the traffic condition, which is useful for traffic planning and automatic accident monitoring.","","POD:978-1-4244-3387-2","10.1109/ECTICON.2009.5137245","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137245","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Data mining;Object detection;Real time systems;Roads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Velocity measurement;Volume measurement","automated highways;computer vision;edge detection;image sequences;information retrieval;monitoring;object detection;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic information systems","Lukas-Kanade optical flow algorithm;Thailand;edge information;foreground moving object extraction;information retrieval;intelligent transportation system;lighting variation;object detection;object tracking;vision-based traffic monitoring system","","8","","7","","","6-9 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the selection process of the HMM initial parameters, the hybrid method adopts GA which uses real number matrix encoding as the representation of the chromosomes and the likelihood values as the fitness values, and then utilizes a modified Baum-Welch algorithm to reevaluate parameters and construct HMM.

Using the existing search capabilities of these online data repositories, however, scientists struggle to quickly locate data that are relevant to their needs or that will integrate with their current data sets. Semantic technologies aim at addressing many of these problems and hold the promise of enabling more powerful ""smart"" searches of online data archives. We describe new semantic search features within the Metacat meta-data system, which is used by many ecological research sites around the world for archiving their data using a standardized metadata format. Our semantic search sys-tem adds to Metacat the ability to store OWL-DL ontologies in addition to semantic annotations that link data set attributes to ontology terms. Our approach also extends Metacat to improve metadata search in multiple ways: (i) by expanding standard keyword searches with ontology term hierarchies; (ii) by allowing keyword searches to be applied to annotations in addition to traditional meta-data; and (iii) by allowing more structured searches over annotations via ontology terms. We describe our implementation of these extensions, and compare and contrast these different types of search for a corpus of annotated documents. As data repositories continue to grow, these tools will be instrumental in helping scientists precisely locate and then interpret data for their research needs.","","POD:978-1-4244-3569-2","10.1109/CISIS.2009.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066940","data;discovery;metadata;ontology;semantic;storage","Biology;Competitive intelligence;Data analysis;Instruments;Intelligent networks;Keyword search;Network synthesis;Ontologies;Software systems;Soil","data mining;ecology;information retrieval systems;knowledge representation languages;meta data;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity;Metacat metadata system;OWL-DL ontologies;annotated documents;data archives;data discovery;metadata repositories;online data repositories;semantic search","","9","","38","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proximity-based, on-demand pairing of patients to records may potentially save time for physicians and nurses, as well as reduce the incidence of error in medication and procedure administration. A cost-effective system has been developed that wirelessly pairs patients with their medical records, and allows confirmation through visual feedback.

Given two raw corpora, one in the general domain, one in an application domain, domain specific verbs connecting different instances are extracted based on syntactic dependency as well as a small set of domain concept instance seeds. Relation types are then discovered based on verb clustering followed by relation instance extraction. The proposed approach requires no predefined relation types, no prior training of domain knowledge, and no need for manually annotated corpora. This method is applicable to any domain corpus and it is especially useful for knowledge-limited and resource-limited domains.

They reveal possible paths an attacker can take to break through security perimeters and traverse a network to reach valuable assets deep inside the network. Although scalability is no longer the main issue, Attack Graphs still have some problems that make them less useful in practice. First, Attack Graphs remain difficult to relate to the network topology. Second, Attack Graphs traditionally only consider the exploitation of vulnerable hosts. Third, Attack Graphs do not rely on automatic identification of potential attack targets. We address these gaps in our MsAMS (Multi-step Attack Modelling and Simulation) tool, based on Mobile Ambients. The tool not only allows the modelling of more static aspects of the network, such as the network topology, but also the dynamics of network attacks. In addition to Mobile Ambients, we use the pagerank algorithm to determine targets and hub scores produced by the HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Search) algorithm to guide the simulation of an attacker searching for targets.","","POD:978-1-4244-3572-2","10.1109/ARES.2009.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066524","Attack Modelling;HITS;Network Security;PageRank;Vulnerability Assessment","Availability;Business;Computer networks;Cost accounting;Explosions;Heuristic algorithms;Network servers;Network topology;Open source software;Scalability","computer networks;graph theory;information retrieval;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","attack graph;computer network security;hypertext induced topic search;mobile ambient;network attack modelling;network attack simulation;network topology;pagerank algorithm","","1","","29","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some architectures, such as X86, allow misaligned data accesses (MDAs), while most modern architectures have the alignment restriction that requires data to be aligned in memory on natural boundaries. In a binary translation system, where the source ISA allows MDA and the target ISA does not, memory operations must be carefully translated to satisfy the alignment restriction. Naive translation will cause frequent misaligned data access traps to occur at runtime on the target machine, and severely slow down the migrated application.This paper evaluates different approaches in handling MDA in binary translation systems. It also proposes a new mechanism to deal with MDAs. Measurements based on SPEC CPU2000 and CPU2006 benchmark show that the proposed approach can significantly outperform existing methods.","","POD:978-0-7695-3576-0","10.1109/CGO.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4907662","binary translation;misaligned memory access;optimization","Application software;Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Computer science;Hardware;Instruction sets;Instruments;Laboratories;Reduced instruction set computing;Runtime","data handling;information retrieval;instruction sets;software architecture;software performance evaluation","CPU2006 benchmark;SPEC CPU2000;dynamic binary translation systems;misaligned data access handling mechanisms;naive translation","","2","","24","","","22-25 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modern advances in measurement and instrumentation have required increasingly sophisticated visual representations, to ensure that scientists can quickly and accurately interpret increasingly complex data. Most recently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as a technology which is capable of collecting a vast amount of data over space and time. The sheer volume of the data makes it difficult to be interpreted by humans into meaningful insights. This presents a number of challenges for developers of visualisation techniques which seek to ``map'' the data sensed by a network. Visualisation techniques helps to turn large amounts of raw data into credible visual information such as graphs, charts, or maps, that can assist in understanding of the meaning of that data. In this paper we propose a map as a suitable data visualisation and extraction tool. We aim to develop an in-network distributed information extraction and visualisation service. Such a service would greatly simplify the production of higher-level information-rich representations suitable for informing other network services and the delivery of field information visualisation.","","POD:978-1-4244-3470-1","10.1109/ICN.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976668","Data Extraction;Interpolation;Mapping Services;Visualisation;Wireless Sensor Networks","Computer networks;Data mining;Data visualization;Humans;Instruments;Monitoring;Production;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Space technology;Wireless sensor networks","cartography;data structures;data visualisation;information retrieval;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","data extraction;data visualisation techniques;in-network distributed information extraction;mapping techniques;network services;planar coordinate systems;visual representations;wireless sensor networks","","1","","21","","","1-6 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of data-rich web pages are generated automatically according to a template. Many solutions, based on wrapper induction techniques have been established to automatically extract data contained in this kind of pages. The solution we propose follows the data extraction phase. It transforms the data into a set of RDF assertions expressed in accordance with an ontology of the domain of interest. Our approach is based on instances. This means that starting from a set of instances we try to find the concept or property of the ontology that has the best match.

The information acquired from RFID tags about the nearest point of interest is processed by the conversational agent that carries a more natural interaction with the user, also exploiting a common sense ontology. The service is accessible using a multimodal browser on personal digital assistants (PDAs); the browser allows the user to interact with the conversational agent by means of spoken language instead of the traditional, keyboard- (or stylus-) based input systems. The resulting system offers a more natural interaction with respect to traditional pre-recorded, audio-visual services, and it is particularly suitable for non technology-skilled users.","","POD:978-1-4244-3569-2","10.1109/CISIS.2009.168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066869","","Animals;Competitive intelligence;Context-aware services;Costs;Humans;Natural languages;Personal digital assistants;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Software systems","information retrieval;notebook computers;radiofrequency identification;telecommunication computing","RFID framework;audiovisual services;common sense ontology;context-aware services;keyboard based input systems;multimodal browser;multimodal information retrieval service;multimodal service provision;personal digital assistants;pervasive services;sensor mesh","","0","","16","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With focus on resource application, this paper studies the problem of resource discovery in broad area. In order to solve problems with centralism and distributional structure for ASP deployment, we propose a multilevel-tree overlay network structure for ASP deployment. Its nodes are highly autonomous and mutually supportive, thus they form tight and flexible information route topology. Among its many enterprise-oriented and application-oriented features, this structure allows for retrieval and multi-spot discovery of resource in broad area. We describe the process of resource discovery based on the structure in detail. Finally, its validity was illustrated with quantified examples and a demo prototype.","","POD:978-0-7695-3635-4","10.1109/ICNDS.2009.128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5116717","application service provider;manufacturing grid;resource discovery;sharing","Application software;Application specific processors;Automotive engineering;Collaboration;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer networks;Electronic mail;Grid computing;Network topology;Resource management","grid computing;information retrieval;manufacturing industries;manufacturing systems","application service provider platform;information route topology;manufacturing grid;manufacturing system;multilevel tree overlay network;resource discovery","","0","","7","","","30-31 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, EST functional relationships can be used to determine a possible gene network for biological processes of interest. In recent years, many researchers have tried to determine EST functional relationships by analyzing the biological literature. However, it has been challenging to find efficient prediction methods. Moreover, an annotated EST is usually associated with many functions, so successful methods must be able to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant functions based on user specifications. This paper proposes a method to discover functional relationships between ESTs of interest by analyzing literature from the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, with user-specified parameters for selecting keywords. This method performs better than the multiple kernel documents method in setting up a specific threshold for gathering materials. The method is also able to uncover known functional relationships, as shown by a comparison with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. The reliable EST relationships predicted by the proposed method can help to construct gene networks for specific biological functions of interest.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2008.2009765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4694115","Expressed sequence tags (ESTs);Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE);functional relationship;literature mining","Biochemistry;Bioinformatics;Biological materials;Biological processes;Couplings;Databases;Encyclopedias;Genomics;Information management;Kernel;Organisms;Prediction methods","bioinformatics;data mining;genetics;genomics;information retrieval systems;molecular biophysics","EST functional relationship;Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database;Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online;expressed sequence tags;gene network;genomic research;literature mining","Algorithms;Expressed Sequence Tags;Information Storage and Retrieval;MEDLINE;Models, Statistical;Random Allocation;Seeds;User-Computer Interface;Vocabulary, Controlled","1","","33","","20081202","April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we present a lexical approach that uses the log-likelihood ratios of word frequencies to automatically provide labels for software components. We present a prototype implementation of our labeling/comparison algorithm and provide examples of its application.

Interferometric methods are used to record and retrieve data by either optical or digital holography for security applications. Digital holograms are widely used in recording and processing three dimensional data, and are attractive for securing three dimensional data. Also, we review optical authentication techniques applied to ID tags with visible and near infrared imaging.

Due to cache size limitations, cache replacement policies are used to find a suitable subset of items for eviction from the cache. The existing policies focus on Euclidean space and consider Euclidean distance as a spatial parameter for eviction. However, in practice the position and movement of objects are constrained to spatial networks where the important distance measure is the network distance. In this paper we propose a cache replacement policy, which considers the network density, network distance and probability of access as important factors for eviction. A series of simulation experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the policy. Results indicate that the proposed cache replacement scheme performs significantly better than the existing policies FAR and PAID.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3721-4; POD:978-1-4244-4484-7","10.1109/MDMW.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4839098","","Computer applications;Computer networks;Costs;Data engineering;Downlink;Educational institutions;Euclidean distance;Global Positioning System;Mathematics;Mobile computing","cache storage;information retrieval;mobile computing","Euclidean space;data caching;location-dependent data;mobile clients;mobile environment;network density;network distance based cache replacement policy","","0","","15","","","27-30 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
