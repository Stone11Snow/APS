A fundamental step for CBPS networks to reach the Internet-scale is to move from the exhaustive filtering service model, where a subscription selects every relevant publication, to a service model capturing the quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity of information consumers' requirements. In previous work, we described a service model allowing information consumers to express the maximum number of publications they would like to receive per service period and how to take advantage of such knowledge to pace the dissemination process. This paper extends by introducing a generic service model that seamlessly supports content-based information retrieval and dissemination and investigates through extensive simulations the performances of six caching policies in terms of consumers satisfaction and bandwidth usage.","1550-3607;15503607","Electronic:978-1-61284-233-2; POD:978-1-61284-232-5","10.1109/icc.2011.5962666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962666","","IEEE Communications Society;Internet;Mediation;Registers;Subscriptions;Topology","Internet;information retrieval","CBPS network;Internet-scale content-based publish-subscribe networks;content-based information dissemination;content-based information retrieval;exhaustive filtering service model;generic service model;qualitative heterogeneity;quantitative heterogeneity","","6","3","13","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some DPA-resistant techniques have been proposed to protect the secret information. However, these techniques require special CADs, which balance wiring capacitance and control the timing to activate the logics for enabling signals. We have proposed a DPA-resistant Domino-RSL technique to design and implement by the standard CAD tool easily. This DPA resistance is achieved by eliminating the correlation between power consumption and cryptography operation. In this paper, the design flow of the Domino-RSL technique is presented and the DPA resistance of a DES circuit, which was designed and fabricated with 0.18μm CMOS technology, is evaluated using the Side-channel Attack Standard Evaluation Board (SASEBO).

Patients are unwilling to accept the EHR system unless their protected health information (PHI) containing highly confidential data is guaranteed proper use and disclosure, which cannot be easily achieved without patients' control over their own PHI. However, cautions must be taken to handle emergencies in which the patient may be physically incompetent to retrieve the controlled PHI for emergency treatment. In this paper, we propose a secure EHR system, HCPP (Healthcaresystem for Patient Privacy), based on cryptographic constructions and existing wireless network infrastructures, to provide privacy protection to patients under any circumstances while enabling timelyPHI retrieval for life-saving treatment in emergency situations. Furthermore, our HCPP system restricts PHI access to authorized (not arbitrary) physicians, who can be traced and held accountable if the accessed PHI is found improperly disclosed. Last but not least, HCPP leverages wireless network access to support efficient and private storage/retrieval of PHI, which underlies a secure and feasible EHR system.","1063-6927;10636927","Electronic:978-0-7695-4364-2; POD:978-1-61284-384-1","10.1109/ICDCS.2011.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5961718","EHR;Emergency;Privacy;Security;Wireless Networks","Encryption;Hospitals;Privacy;Servers","cryptography;data privacy;emergency services;health care;information retrieval;medical information systems;radio networks;telemedicine","HCPP;PHI access;cryptography based secure EHR system;electronic health record;emergency healthcare;healthcaresystem for patient privacy;life-saving treatment;paper record systems;protected health information;timelyPHI retrieval;wireless network infrastructures","","16","","35","","","20-24 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have developed a distributed collaborative mechanism to enable users to provide feedback to ontology authors, to request new terms, and to use provisional terms in their applications. The ontology authors can use the same infrastructure to explore this feedback in their ontology-editing environment, to update the ontology, to record their decisions on the users' requests, and to publish both the updated ontology and the information on how they acted on the requested changes. Specifically, we present the Notes ontology that we use to represent the different types of user feedback and change requests, the service-oriented Notes API to access the information that conforms to this ontology, and the two ontology editing and publishing environments, WebProtege and NCBO BioPortal, that use this API to provide services for their users.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-639-2; POD:978-1-61284-638-5","10.1109/CTS.2011.5928720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928720","Collaborative software;Ontology development;Semantic Web;Web services","Communities;Java;Knowledge based systems;OWL;Ontologies;Proposals;Publishing","Internet;application program interfaces;data handling;electronic publishing;groupware;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","NCBO BioPortal;Notes ontology;WebProtege;data annotation;data integration;distributed collaborative mechanism;feedback;information access;ontology development;ontology editing;ontology editing environment;ontology publishing;semantic infrastructure;service-oriented Notes API","","1","","17","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key enablers are the smart phones (e.g., iPhones and Android phones) equipped with onboard sensors (e.g., cameras, accelerometer, compass, GPS), and various wireless devices (e.g., WiFi and 2/3G). The goal of this paper is to design a scalable sensor networking platform where millions of users on the move can participate in urban sensing and share location-aware information using always-on cellular data connections. We propose a two-tier sensor networking platform called GeoServ where mobile users publish/access sensor data via an Internet-based distributed P2P overlay network. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold: a location-aware sensor data retrieval scheme that supports geographic range queries, and a location-aware publish-subscribe scheme that enables efficient multicast routing over a group of subscribed users.

"Healthcare information behavior: Implicit collaboration with social tagging systems","M. A. Zarro","Drexel University, College of Information Science and Technology, USA","2011 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)","20110711","2011","","","639","639","Healthcare consumers in the United States are increasingly turning to the Internet for health information and advice. A majority of Internet users in the United States use the Web to find healthcare information for themselves or others. They are collaborating with other consumers in ways that were impossible before the advent of broadband connections, social media websites, and Web2.0 technologies. Some collaboration is explicit, like the posting of health topics on question answering sites like Yahoo! Answers, or joining a health maintenance discussion board. Other collaborative behaviors are less obvious and may be considered an implicit part of a healthcare consumer's Web activities. One such implicit collaboration is the use of the website Delicious.com to bookmark and tag Web-based healthcare information resources for organization and future retrieval. Tags assigned by an individual are visible to other users, resulting in a peer-created knowledge organization system of information resources. Tags can be created by the user solely for their own use, yet the community benefits from the aggregation of individual efforts. We explore the implicit collaboration through an examination of user contributed tags for consumer health resources on the social tagging website Delicious.com. This work investigates the characteristics of tags for healthcare resources on the web. Tags were collected using two methods. First, we gathered the top 100 published search terms for the consumer health website MedlinePlus, and used these terms to retrieve search results using the Yahoo! BOSS API. We then collected the most frequent Delicious.com tags for the first URL in each search. Second, human users were asked to perform fictional healthcare searches while evaluating a prototype search engine. Returned with search results were Delicious tags we collected and stored for use in guided search and other healthcare information retrieval systems. Evaluation of tags includes user intervi- - ews and comparisons to existing professional medical vocabularies and emerging resources like the Open Access Consumer Health Vocabulary [3]. In the Web2.0 model, peers have emerged as ""guides"" to health information, minimizing the role of established gatekeepers [4]. Finding credible, high-quality, and comprehensive health information is a continued challenge. Web users also struggle with health literacy and vocabulary gap between clinicians and laypersons. This work may lead to enhanced methods of developing consumer health vocabularies, Web search and browsing guides, and other tools for healthcare information seekers.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-639-2; POD:978-1-61284-638-5","10.1109/CTS.2011.5928752","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928752","Health Information Management;Mashups;Online services;Search methods;Social network services;Tagging","Collaboration;Informatics;Information science;Internet;Medical services;Tagging;Vocabulary","Internet;health care;information retrieval;medical information systems;social networking (online)","Internet users;United States;Yahoo!

The effectiveness of data analysis depends largerly on the data accessibility and transparency of an analytical model of domain. As usual, analytical model of domain is a set of OLAP-models for solving particular problems. The method of constructing a conceptual OLAP-model as an integral analytical model of the domain is proposed. The integral analytical model includes all possible combinations of analyzed objects and gives them the opportunity to be manipulated ad-hoc. The suggested method consists in a formal concept analysis of measures and dimensions based on an expert knowledge about the structure of analyzing objects and their comparability. As a result, conceptual OLAP-model is represented as a concept lattice of multidimensional cubes. Concept lattice features allow the decision maker to discover the nonstandard analytical dependencies on the set of all actual analyzing objects. Conceptual OLAP-model implementation improves the effectiveness of decision making support based on on-line analytical processing of multidimensional data.","","Electronic:978-953-233-059-5; POD:978-1-4577-0996-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5967306","","Analytical models;Context;Decision making;Estimation;Lattices;Organizations;Patents","data mining;decision making;formal concept analysis;information retrieval","analytical decision making support;concept lattice features;data accessibility;data transparency;formal concept analysis;integral OLAP model;multidimensional data processing;nonstandard analytical dependency;online analytical processing","","0","","15","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"3D Visualization of small scale spatial object based on Digital Elevation Model","C. Crysdian","Department of Teknik Informatika - Universitas Islam Negeri Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang Jl.

The motivation is to visualize a small spatial object as detail as possible. Here, small scale spatial object is defined as a spatial object that has a relatively small size such as a city, a volcano, or a lake. To accomplish this task, the research was conducted in three stages i.e. elevation data retrieval, 3D visualization and data enhancements, and the last is definition of object boundary. Elevation data is obtained from SRTM dataset that has 3 arc-second or approximately 90 meters data resolution. Data obtained from SRTM is then visualized in 3D, in which visualization is enriched with view angle setting. Results of visualization show that data enhancement is necessary to be developed to have better presentation of small-scale spatial object in 3D. This paper proposes several methods namely population and neighbors average, to enhance elevation dataset. Comparison among these methods is held to choose the best method to support 3D visualization. Different view angle setting is used in this stage. After having the best method to enhance elevation data set, next stage of the work is to develop spatial object boundary. This step aims to precisely view the object of interest. To develop object boundary, a set of points in term latitude and longitude coordinate is defined and connected by a set of edges computed using linear equation.","","Electronic:978-602-97479-1-1; POD:978-1-4244-9335-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952320","3D Visualization;Digital Elevation Model;Spatial Data","Cities and towns;Data models;Data visualization;Digital elevation models;Earth;Equations;Three dimensional displays","data visualisation;digital elevation models;geographic information systems;information retrieval;solid modelling","3D visualization;data enhancement;digital elevation model;elevation data retrieval;linear equation;small scale spatial object;spatial object boundary","","0","","10","","","2-3 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computer systems are becoming more heterogeneous with increasing node and core-per-node counts. Also, a growing number of data-access mechanisms, of varying characteristics, are supported within a single computer system. We describe a new hierarchical collective communication framework that takes advantage of hardware-specific data-access mechanisms. It is flexible, with run-time hierarchy specification, and sharing of collective communication primitives between collective algorithms. Data buffers are shared between levels in the hierarchy reducing collective communication management overhead. We have implemented several versions of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) collective operations, MPI Barrier() and MPI Bcast(), and run experiments using up to 49, 152 processes on a Cray XT5, and a small InfiniBand based cluster. At 49, 152 processes our barrier implementation outperforms the optimized native implementation by 75%. 32 Byte and one Mega-Byte broadcasts outperform it by 62% and 11%, respectively, with better scalability characteristics.

Google ignores the structure of the expression x(y+x) because Google is not supported with the required tools to increase the accuracy when searching for math expressions. Searching for different kinds of mathematical constructs require special processing and tools because of the nature of those expressions.

In this paper, we investigate the two primary methods for persistent storage on mobile devices and use a battery of tests to evaluate the optimal ways in which to retrieve persistent data from mobile devices. In our investigation, we uncover that if the number of records are less than 1000 then sequential files should be used as the data storage option.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to support cooperative caching in DTNs, which enables the sharing and coordination of cached data among multiple nodes and reduces data access delay. Our basic idea is to intentionally cache data at a set of Network Central Locations (NCLs), which can be easily accessed by other nodes in the network. We propose an effective scheme which ensures appropriate NCL selection based on a probabilistic selection metric, and coordinate multiple caching nodes to optimize trade off between data accessibility and caching overhead.

In most existing implementations, the atomicity requirement is implemented through locking-based schemes, which have proven inefficient, especially for non-contiguous I/O. We claim that using a versioning-enabled storage back-end has the potential to avoid the expensive synchronization induced by locking-based schemes.

Merely sharing the logics across the enterprises entails developers to understand the service logic prior to integration which is complex and time-consuming task. The demand focuses to have a computerized system to integrate diverse services dynamically from different enterprise as per the contract. Prior to the actual process of integration, the individual processes need to be analyzed for extraction of the information as to which basic properties of business logic they hold and must decide on proper approach to merge the selected processes. The features catered by the existing frameworks are not centered on this issue and one such a framework proposed in this paper channelizes its function to extract and integrate the service logics robotically. The proposed framework exposes the requirements as business rules and extracts the required logics in runtime through business logic manager. One of the innovative concepts of the proposed framework is business logic property evaluation system which evaluates the business logics with respect to the run time computational criteria, identifies the dependencies between them and integrates in right way. This allows enterprises to share and integrate the services dynamically without developer's intervention at any stage. Thus this can be used for any IT enterprises in modern service industry to reduce the threshold of development and operation of services.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0590-8; POD:978-1-4577-0588-5","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972336","B2B collaboration;Business logic property evaluation system;Service integration;computational criteria","Authorization;Contracts;Feature extraction;Industries;Web services","commerce;groupware;information retrieval;integrated software;service industries","B2B collaboration;IT enterprises;business enterprises;business logic property evaluation;business logic sharing;computational criteria;diverse services;dynamic market demands;dynamic service integration;information extraction;modern service industry","","0","","11","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The PARAFAC2 is employed to effectively harness the multi-label information for dimensionality reduction. Any vectorized test auditory representation of temporal modulations is first projected onto the semantic space derived via the PARAFAC2 and the coefficient vector is obtained. Then, the annotation vector is obtained by multiplying this coefficient vector by the left singular vectors of the second slice (i.e., the slice associated to the label vector).

In this paper, in order to solve such difficulties and to activate the broad use of the public information, a REST (Representational State Transfer)ful JPIC (Java Public Information Connectivity) SDK (Software Development Kit) is proposed and developed by combining the REST architecture and the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) architecture together. In order for the verification of the developed JPIC SDK, four JPIC drivers are developed for the public information in Korea on the harmful food, public jobs, performances & shows and weather & disaster forecast.

In particular, the assumption underpinning this discipline is the availability of data coming from business process executions. In business process theory, once the process has been defined, it is possible to have a number of instances of the process running at the same time. Usually, the identification of different instances is referred to a specific “case id” field in the log exploited by process mining techniques. The software systems that support the execution of a business process, however, often do not record explicitly such information. This paper presents an approach that faces the absence of the “case id” information: we have a set of extra fields, decorating each single activity log, that are known to carry the information on the process instance. A framework is addressed, based on simple relational algebra notions, to extract the most promising case ids from the extra fields. The work is a generalization of a real business case.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9927-4; POD:978-1-4244-9926-7","10.1109/CIDM.2011.5949450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949450","","Algebra;Buildings;Business;Context;Data mining;Semantics;Software systems","business data processing;data mining;identification;information retrieval;relational algebra","activity log;business process execution;business process modelling;case id information;data mining;decorative attribute;process instance identification;process mining;relational algebra;semiautomated process instance discovery","","1","","14","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A codebook is learned based on the proposed homonym scheme such that its histogram can be used to discriminate objects of different labels.

The importance of a locale semantic search comparing to a classical search method is that most contributors are not formal and well behaved in language structure, using lots of slang and alternative means of communication. As Brazil is a continental country it created several local ways of communications that vary from place to place creating additional difficulties for a search tool.

Numerous on-line music stores account for a growing share of record sales. The widespread adoption of digital audio on home computers and especially mobile devices, and numerous on-line music stores show the size of this market. Handling the ever growing size of both private and commercial collections however becomes increasingly difficult. Computer algorithms that can understand and interpret characteristics of music, and organise and recommend them for and to their users can be of great assistance. Music is an inherently multi-modal type of data, and the lyrics associated with the music are as essential to the reception and the message of a song as is the audio. Album covers are carefully designed by artists to convey a message consistent with the music and image of a band. Music videos, fan sites and other sources of information add to that in a usually coherent manner. In this paper, we focus on exploring the lyrics domain of music, and how this information can be combined with the acoustic domain. We evaluate our approach by means of a common task in music information retrieval, musical genre classification.

However it is time-consuming and tedious to read and understand whole documents even if the documents can be accessed easily. In addition, what most people want from meeting minutes is to catch the main issues of the meeting and to understand its contexts rather than to know whole discussions of the meetings. Existing text summarization techniques applied to this problem often fail because they are developed without considering the characteristics of the meeting minutes. In order to improve the performance of summarization of meeting minutes, this paper proposes a novel method for summarizing documents based-on two-step sentence extraction. It first extracts the sentences which are addressing the main issues. For each issue expressed in the extracted sentences, the sentences related with the issue are then extracted in the second step. Then, by transforming the extracted sentences into a tree-structure form, the results of the proposed method can be understood better than existing methods. In the experiments, the proposed method shows remarkable improvement in performance and this result implies that the proposed method is plausible for summarizing meeting minutes.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4367-3; POD:978-1-61284-427-5","10.1109/ITNG.2011.210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945307","Document summarization;Text mining","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Assembly;Dictionaries;Minutes;Silicon;Training","information retrieval;public information systems;text analysis;tree data structures","document access;meeting minutes;organizations;publicly available documents;text summarization;tree-structure form;two-step sentence extraction","","1","","10","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A simple way to answer a conjunctive fuzzy query is to apply one of the existing algorithms for answering classical queries using views in order to determine all the possible rewritings. Then, to compute the satisfaction degree for each rewriting and to keep and run only those with accepted scores. However, this method incurs an unnecessary cost since it determines also the useless query rewritings and waste of resources for useless scores computation. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose in this paper an efficient algorithm to generate the N best query rewritings which are likely to return the top k-tuples fitting with user preferences. The proposed algorithm discards useless rewritings from the query rewritings searching step and hence, generates the likely satisfactory ones ordered according to their satisfaction degrees of the user query. This method accelerates query processing and reduces query running time. We show in this paper the interest of this algorithm in middleware applications by using a case study in middle ware based context-aware pervasive health care where doctors, haven't enough time to fix carefully their queries in some emergency cases, require to flexibly use medical applications and need to quickly receiving best answers while treating patients in the shortest waiting time and to free resources for eventually other urgent requests.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4404-5; POD:978-1-4577-0142-9","10.1109/ICCSA.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959619","Middleware;conjunctive fuzzy query;pervasive healthcare;satisfaction degree;top-K tuples;top-N rewritings algorithm","Algorithm design and analysis;Medical information systems;Medical services;Middleware;Mobile handsets;Personal digital assistants","approximation theory;fuzzy logic;health care;middleware;patient treatment;question answering (information retrieval);rewriting systems;ubiquitous computing","best query rewriting;conjunctive fuzzy query answering;conjunctive fuzzy query rewriting;emergency cases;frequency distribution;histogram approximation;k-tuples fitting;middleware based context aware pervasive health care;patient treatment","","0","","13","","","20-23 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To efficiently provide content access across geographic locations, content storage nodes with limited capacity are conventionally organized in a multi-layer architecture to facilitate vertical as well as horizontal peer content retrievals, each of which may have different bandwidth constraints and transport costs. Content management, i.e., caching strategies, is deployed to efficiently utilize storage nodes and further reduce network retrieval traffic and cost. An optimal system design of such a multi-layer system needs to accommodate the trade-offs between vertical communication, peer communication, storage capacity and the users' retrieval traffic, driven by caching policies. In this paper, we propose a generic optimization framework based on steady-state content diffusion to minimize the total content retrieval cost in multi-layer content distribution systems, while considering the aforementioned trade-offs. The derived optimal content diffusion can evaluate the optimality of caching policies, and dimension the size of the system and the node caching capacity. Furthermore, we develop Peer Aware Content Caching (PACC) policies based on the derived optimal content diffusion. Our simulation results show that PACC effectively caches content and minimizes vertical and horizontal content retrieval costs under different system scenarios.","1550-3607;15503607","Electronic:978-1-61284-233-2; POD:978-1-61284-232-5","10.1109/icc.2011.5962824","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962824","","Bandwidth;Collaboration;Cost function;IEEE Communications Society;Peer to peer computing;Servers","cache storage;content management;information retrieval;optimisation;peer-to-peer computing","content clouds;content management;data sharing;file-sharing networks;horizontal peer content retrievals;multi-layer architecture;multi-layer content distribution systems;on-demand video services;optimization;peer aware content caching;retrieval cost;ubiquitous data access","","2","","18","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, software analyses are offered as Restful web services that can be accessed and composed over the Internet. SOFAS services are accessible through a software analysis catalog where any project stakeholder can, depending on the needs or interests, pick specific analyses, combine them, let them run remotely and then fetch the final results. That way, software developers, testers, architects, or quality assurance experts are given access to quality analysis services.

The problem of automatic musical genre detection has attracted large attention in the last decade, due to the emergence of digital music databases and Internet.

Digital watermarking is a technique in which apiece of digital information is embedded into an image and extracted later for ownership verification. Secret digital data can be embedded either in spatial domain or in frequency domain of the cover data. In this paper, a new singular value decomposition (SVD) and discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) based technique is proposed for hiding watermark in full frequency band of color images (DSFW). The quality of the watermarked image and extracted watermark is measured using peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and normalized correlation (NC) respectively. It is observed that the quality of the watermarked image is maintained with the value of 36dB.

In this work we combine such traditional distance measures for document analysis with link information between documents to improve clustering results. In particular, we test the effectiveness of geodesic distances as similarity measures under the space assumption of spherical geometry in a 0-sphere. Our proposed distance measure is thus a combination of the cosine distance of the term-document matrix and some curvature values in the geodesic distance formula. To estimate these curvature values, we calculate clustering coefficient values for every document from the link graph of the data set and increase their distinctiveness by means of a heuristic as these clustering coefficient values are rough estimates of the curvatures. To evaluate our work, we perform clustering tests with the k-means algorithm on the English Wikipedia hyperlinked data set with both traditional cosine distance and our proposed geodesic distance. The effectiveness of our approach is measured by computing micro-precision values of the clusters based on the provided categorical information of each article.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9927-4; POD:978-1-4244-9926-7","10.1109/CIDM.2011.5949449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949449","","Clustering algorithms;Encyclopedias;Equations;Internet;Level measurement","document handling;information retrieval systems;pattern clustering","English Wikipedia hyperlinked data;Web document clustering;clustering coefficient value;cosine distance;document analysis;geodesic distance;information retrieval systems;k-means algorithm;term-document matrix","","1","","22","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The management of preservation policies for large collections can be an onerous task. Typical policies may control ingest of records, extraction of required provenance information, replication of records, retention and disposition, and validation of assessment criteria. The iRODS (the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System) is an exemplar that provides distributed data management under a policy-oriented framework that can be applied to long-term data archiving.

First, we propose a novel approach, Trustrace, inspired by Web trust models to improve the precision and recall of traceability links: Trustrace uses any traceability recovery approach to obtain a set of traceability links, which rankings are then re-evaluated using a set of other traceability recovery approaches. Second, we propose a novel traceability recovery approach, Histrace, to identify traceability links between requirements and source code through CVS/SVN change logs using a Vector Space Model (VSM). We combine a traditional recovery traceability approach with Histrace to build Trustrace<sup>VSM, Histrace</sup> in which we use Histrace as one expert adding knowledge to the traceability links extracted from CVS/SVN change logs. We apply Trustrace<sup>VSM, Histrace</sup> on two case studies to compare its traceability links with those recovered using only the VSM-based approach, in terms of precision and recall.

In addition, intelligent input, which aims to revolutionize the way people on diet selection, is introduced to reduce the users' efforts in food searching. The intelligent input employs image recognition techniques alongside onboard nutritional information to give feedback as to whether a particular food/dish is appropriate or not for a user on a specific diet.

They have largely relied on the measurement of the sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) and the beta rhythms in electroencephalography (EEG). However, most BCIs of this type have exploited SMR and beta rhythms observed from a few EEG channels over the sensorimotor area. They also extracted movement-related information from each channel independently, without considering connectivity between channels. In this study, we aim to investigate whether we can obtain useful information of movements from the connectivity measures across a wide range of EEG channels, over the whole brain. To address this question, we evaluated a simple connectivity measure - cross-correlation coefficients (CCs) - for twenty-two EEG channels distributed over different brain regions to differentiate four different motor imagery states, including left hand, right hand, both feet, and tongue. The tem oral variations of CCs across twenty-two channels exhibited distinct patterns as to four motor imagery states. It suggests that we may use connectivity as a useful source to derive noninvasive BCIs.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4399-4; POD:978-1-4577-0111-5","10.1109/PRNI.2011.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5961318","brain-computer interfaces;connectivity;correlation coefficients;motor imagery","Brain;Brain computer interfaces;Correlation;Electroencephalography;Image segmentation;Synchronous motors;Tongue","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;information retrieval;neurophysiology","beta rhythm measurement;brain activity;brain-computer interface;cross-correlation coefficients;electroencephalography;interchannel connectivity;motor execution commands;motor imagery EEG signals;movement related information extraction;noninvasive BCI application;sensorimotor rhythm measurement;simple connectivity measure","","1","","21","","","16-18 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The computation requirements are often larger than resources available at hand in an enterprise and it would like to outsource it for high speed computation or data management requirements. In other cases a small enterprise would like to lease computation or data archiving resources as per demand. Cloud computing is a new paradigm which may be used to handle such situations. It offers a virtual environment at a small initial investment by entrepreneurs planning to develop large applications scalable as the scope and workload increases. The computer hardware and software are available in virtualized environments of cloud computing offering Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) through Datacenters and Cloud Service Providers (CSP). The paradigm shift provides elastic infrastructure, efficiency of resource utilization, reduction in upfront capital investment and focus on core activities. A model for cloud computing for telemedic services is being developed to cater for large data archive of Clinical Data Records (CDR), Decision Support Systems (DSS) and event based notification and monitoring system in a typical hospital.

Since vehicles are not critically limited by the storage space, it is a less of a problem which data items to cache. Rather, a critical design issue is how to invalidate them when data items are updated. This is particularly a concern due to vehicles' high-speed mobility. In this paper we proposed a scheme in which we classify data in two categories and use two different Invalidation Reports (IRs) to invalidate them.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4437-3; POD:978-1-4577-0543-4","10.1109/CSNT.2011.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5966421","IR;IVANET;cache invalidation","Ad hoc networks;IP networks;Internet;Mobile communication;Registers;Servers;Vehicles","Internet;cache storage;information retrieval;optimisation;vehicular ad hoc networks","IVANET;Internet;cache invalidation techniques;data access;invalidation reports;optimization;roadside infrastructures;vehicular ad hoc network","","0","","12","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is therefore highly desirable to automatically construct summaries, titles, latent topic trees and key term-based topic labels for these spoken documents to aid the user in browsing. We refer to this as semantic analysis and organization. Also, as network content is both copious and dynamic, with topics and domains changing everyday, the approaches here must be primarily unsupervised. We propose a framework for unsupervised semantic analysis and organization of spoken documents and for this purpose propose two measures derived from latent topic analysis: latent topic significance and latent topic entropy. We show that these can be integrated into an application system, with which the user can more easily navigate archives of spoken documents. Probabilistic latent semantic analysis is used as a typical example approach for unsupervised topic analysis in most experiments, although latent Dirichlet allocation is also used in some experiments to show that the proposed measures are equally applicable for different analysis approaches.

Thus, a novel pitch-estimation method is proposed by integrating temporal-autocorrelation and spectral-salience methods. As a pre-processing block, spectral smoothing is applied to enhance the stationarity of the noisy input signal. To calculate the similarity between the MIDI database and input humming signal, the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is used. Jang's corpus and AURORA2 database are selected as humming and background noise signals, respectively. Compared with the standard pitch estimation algorithm in the ITU-T G.729 speech codec, the proposed pitch estimation method improves the average accuracy by 11.7% for the 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) noise case.

"Dual-Doppler radar three-dimensional wind field retrieval software system and applications","Haiguang Zhou","State Key Laboratory of Severe Weather, Chinese Academy of Meteorological Science, Beijing, China","2011 International Conference on Computer Science and Service System (CSSS)","20110804","2011","","","360","365","Doppler weather radar is a powerful tool to investigate the structure of the convective weather system, because it can provide fine temporal and spatial resolution data. The Doppler velocity is very useful to study the dynamic structure of the severe weather system. But it is more difficult to investigate the three-dimensional (3D) kinematic structure of the severe weather system, because the Doppler velocity is the radial velocity along the weather radar antenna. The dual-Doppler weather radar 3D wind field retrieval algorithm can provide more accurate 3D wind field. It is a very important tool to investigate the 3D fine dynamic structure of the convective weather system. Since 1998, China began to setup the Doppler weather radar network in mainland. Some dual-Doppler radar networks have been established. It is very necessary to develop the dual-Doppler weather radar 3D wind field retrieval software system. It is not only important to investigate the 3D fine kinematic structure of the convective weather system, but also important to improve the nowcasting of the convective weather system. This paper develops the dual-Doppler weather radar wind retrieval software system for the first time in China mainland. It can retrieve the 3D wind filed from the dual-Doppler weather radar volume scan data in real time. The 3D wind field has high temporal and spatial resolution. It is very useful for studying the 3D fine kinematic structure of the convective weather system. The architecture and implement of the software system is presented. The 3D wind field of the snowstorm and squall line were retrieved with the dual-Doppler radar data for the first time in China mainland. It shows that this software system is very useful for studying the 3D fine structure of the severe weather system and improving the severe weather system nowcasting precision.","","DVD:978-1-4244-9761-4; Electronic:978-1-4244-9763-8; POD:978-1-4244-9762-1","10.1109/CSSS.2011.5974436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5974436","dual-Doppler radar;snowstorm;software system;squall line;wind retrieval","Doppler radar;Meteorological radar;Software systems;Three dimensional displays;Wind","Doppler radar;information retrieval;meteorological radar;radar computing","3D fine kinematic structure;3D wind field retrieval algorithm;Doppler weather radar;convective weather system;dual-Doppler radar;snowstorm;three-dimensional wind field retrieval software system","","0","","11","","","27-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Relation of spectrum could accurately extract wide water body such as Tong-Lu canal, but it was difficult to extract a smaller water body. Moreover, relation of spectrum could not extract water information covered by sparse vegetation. In contrast, NDWI and MNDWI did better. The water information by NDWI always mixed with built-up land noise and thus the area of a water body was overestimated. MNDWI could reveal more subtle features such as the distribution of suspended sediment, water quality changes than NDWI. MNDWI could significantly highlight the water information, especially Haohe river that surrounds the city center. MNDWI could depress the buildings' effect while highlighting water information and accurately extract the water information. MNDWI revealed successfully significant non-pollution of the water.

In addition, tag correlation is another useful information for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem.

A new method that uses neighbor and link concepts has more suitable performance than previous methods in this field. Two documents are neighbors if their similarity is more than a defined threshold. If they are neighbors, neighbor matrix element is set to one, otherwise it is set to zero. So we lose some information about documents similarity in it and therefore decrease of accuracy. To overcome this problem, we propose two methods of “discrete correlation” and “fuzzy correlation”, which both of them attempt to accurate neighbor definition more and more and so reach better clustering results.

"Applying Semantic Suffix Net to suffix tree clustering","J. Janruang; S. Guha","Computer Science & Information Management Program, Asian Institute of Technology, Pathumthani, Thailand","2011 3rd Conference on Data Mining and Optimization (DMO)","20110804","2011","","","146","152","In this paper we consider the problem of clustering snippets returned from search engines. We propose a technique to invoke semantic similarity in the clustering process. Our technique improves on the well-known STC method, which is a highly efficient heuristic for clustering web search results. However, a weakness of STC is that it cannot cluster semantic similar documents. To solve this problem, we propose a new data structure to represent suffixes of a single string, called a Semantic Suffix Net (SSN). A generalized semantic suffix net is created to represent suffixes of a set of strings by using a new operator to partially combine nets. A key feature of this new operator is to find a joint point by using semantic similarity and string matching; net pairs combination then begins at that joint point. This logic causes the number of nodes and branches of a generalized semantic suffix net to decrease. The operator then uses the line of suffix links as a boundary to separate the net. A generalized semantic suffix net is then incorporated into the STC algorithm so that it can cluster semantically similar snippets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves upon conventional STC.","2155-6938;21556938","Electronic:978-1-61284-212-7; POD:978-1-61284-211-0","10.1109/DMO.2011.5976519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976519","data mining;semantic suffix net;semantic web search results clustering;text mining","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data structures;Joints;Pediatrics;Semantics","data structures;document handling;information retrieval;pattern clustering;search engines;string matching;trees (mathematics)","STC algorithm;data structure;search engines;semantic similarity;semantic suffix net;string matching;suffix tree clustering","","0","","16","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A knowledge visualization model for evaluating Internet news agencies on conflicting news","I. T. Medeni; S. Peker; M. E. Uyar","&#x00C7;ankaya University Department of Computer Engineering, Ankara, Turkey","2011 Proceedings of the 34th International Convention MIPRO","20110728","2011","","","850","853","With the advent of the Internet, the news agencies have published news on their websites for the internet readers. This improvement enables Internet readers to access news easily and also to gain information and knowledge in real time manner. Since there are many online news agencies and online newspapers, readers generally have difficulty to decide which newspaper or agency provides the most reliable news. The reliability can be defined as using consistent and proper source of news especially on conflicting news but this increases news' source complexity. As a knowledge management technique, knowledge visualization is one of the ways for readers to decrease this complexity level. In this study, we propose a knowledge visualization model to identify success rates of the online news agencies and online newspapers regarding how consistent they are with the concluded actual news content. This model will be a baseline to indicate knowledge management capabilities of the agencies based on conflicted news categories.","","Electronic:978-953-233-059-5; POD:978-1-4577-0996-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5967174","Conflicting News;Knowledge Management;Knowledge Parameters;Knowledge Visualization Model;News Agencies","Accuracy;Artificial intelligence;Data visualization;Internet;Knowledge management;Organizations;Visualization","Internet;Web sites;data visualisation;electronic publishing;information retrieval;knowledge management","Internet news agency;Internet reader;Web sites;knowledge management technique;knowledge visualization model;online newspaper","","0","","14","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
