"Evaluating Temporal Information Understanding with Temporal Question Answering","N. UzZaman; H. Llorens; J.

Given the complexity of temporal QA, most of the efforts have focused, so far, on extracting temporal information, which has been evaluated with corpus-based evaluation. However, the QA task represents a natural way to evaluate temporal information understanding, and creating question sets is less costly for humans than manually annotating temporal information, which is required to perform corpus-based evaluation. Additionally, QA performance better captures the understanding of important temporal information as compared to corpus-based evaluation where all information is equally important for scoring. This paper presents a temporal QA system that performs temporal reasoning. It can be used to answer temporal questions (factoid, list and yes/no), about any document annotated in Time ML. In the paper, we show how this system can be used to evaluate automated temporal information understanding. Our QA-based evaluation results suggest that (i) the available temporal annotations are not complete, and (ii) QA provides a less costly and more reliable way of evaluating temporal understanding systems. To favour replicability, we made the temporal QA system and the question set used in the evaluation available.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4859-3; POD:978-1-4673-4433-3","10.1109/ICSC.2012.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337086","TIPSem;TRIOS;evaluation;question answering;temporal;temporal evaluation;temporal question answering","Cognition;Conferences;Gold;Humans;Semantics;Syntactics","information retrieval;natural language processing","QA;corpus based evaluation;evaluating temporal information understanding;temporal annotation scheme time ML;temporal information extraction;temporal question answering","","2","","14","","","19-21 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a systematic framework from in vitro data collection, histology preparation, IVUS-histology registration along with matching procedure, and finally a robust texture-derived unsupervised atherosclerotic plaque labeling. We have performed our algorithm on in vitro and in vivo images acquired with single-element 40 MHz and 64-elements phased array 20 MHz transducers, respectively. In former case, we have quantified results by local contrasting of constructed tissue colormaps with corresponding histology images employing an independent expert and in the latter case, virtual histology images have been utilized for comparison. We tackle one of the main challenges in the field that is the reliability of tissues behind arc of calcified plaques and validate the results through a novel random walks framework by incorporating underlying physics of ultrasound imaging. We conclude that proposed framework is a formidable approach for retrieving imperative information regarding tissues and building a reliable training dataset for supervised classification and its extension for in vivo applications.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2213338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6269061","Atherosclerosis;histology;intravascular ultrasound (IVUS);plaque characterization;random walks;wavelet packets","Arteries;Atherosclerosis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Filter banks;Reliability;Ultrasonic imaging","biological tissues;biomedical transducers;biomedical ultrasonics;blood vessels;cardiology;diseases;image registration;image segmentation;information retrieval systems;medical image processing;ultrasonic transducer arrays","IVUS-histology registration;calcified plaques;constructed tissue colormaps;coronary arteries;frequency 20 MHz;frequency 40 MHz;image registration;image segmentation;imperative information retrieval;in vitro data collection;interventional cardiology;intravascular ultrasound images;iterative self-organizing atherosclerotic tissue labeling;lesion heterogeneity;phased array transducers;random walks framework;real-time cross-sectional images;reliable training dataset;tissue stringent spatial-spectral behavior;virtual histology","Algorithms;Echocardiography;Histological Techniques;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Myocardium;Plaque, Atherosclerotic;Ultrasonography, Interventional","10","","40","","20120815","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Morphology process takes word in isolation and fails to disambiguate correct sense of a word. Part-Of-Speech Tagging (POST) takes word sequences in to consideration to resolve the correct sense of a word present in the given sentence. Efficient POST have been developed for processing of English, Japanese, and Chinese languages but it is lacking for Indian languages. In this paper our work present simple rule-based POST for Sanskrit language. It uses rule based approach to tag each word of the sentence. These rules are stored in the database. It parses the given Sanskrit sentence and assigns suitable tag to each word automatically.

"A Novel Framework for Outsourcing and Sharing Searchable Encrypted Data on Hybrid Cloud","J. Li; C. Jia; J. Li; Z. Liu","Coll. of Inf. Tech. Sci., Nankai Univ., Tianjin, China","2012 Fourth International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems","20121025","2012","","","1","7","With the rapid growth of data, it is desirable to outsource data on remote storage server. The emergency of cloud computing makes the dream true and more and more sensitive data are being centralized into cloud for sharing. Since the public cloud server cannot be fully trusted in protecting them, encryption is a promising way to keep confidentiality but leads to high communication and computation overhead for some useful data operations. Searchable encryption initiated by Song et al. provides an efficient solution to support for keyword-based search directly on encrypted data. Nevertheless, existing work depends on key sharing among authorized users, which inevitably causes the risks of key exposure and abuse. In this paper, the keyword search over encrypted data with differential privileges is addressed. We provide a novel framework for secure outsourcing and sharing of encrypted data on hybrid cloud. The framework is full-featured: i) it enables authorized users to perform keyword-based search directly on encrypted data without sharing the same private key, ii) it provides two-layered access control to achieve fine-grained sharing of encrypted data. The security analysis shows that the proposed generic construction satisfies the requirements of message privacy and keyword privacy.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2281-2; POD:978-1-4673-2279-9","10.1109/iNCoS.2012.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338036","","Cloud computing;Encryption;Privacy;Public key;Servers","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;information retrieval;outsourcing","cloud computing;computation overhead;fine-grained sharing;hybrid cloud;key sharing;keyword privacy;keyword-based search;message privacy;novel framework;public cloud server;remote storage server;searchable encrypted data;searchable encryption;secure outsourcing;two-layered access control;useful data operations","","5","","14","","","19-21 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This representation separates the content and context and adds a number of semantic structures that encapsulate inferred information. The expanded semantic graph approach facilitates finding additional matches, identifying and eliminating poor matches, and prioritizing matches based on how much new knowledge is provided. By focusing on information of interest, doing pre-processing, and reducing processing requirements, the approach is applicable to problems where related information of interest is sought across a massive body of free text documents. Key aspects of the approach include (1) expanding the nodes and edges through inference using DL-Safe rules, abductive hypotheses, and syntactic patterns, (2) separating semantic content into nodes and semantic context into edges, and (3) applying relatedness measures on a node, edge, and sub graph basis.

First, the sparse and the low-rank subspace clustering is tested for music structure analysis by employing three types of beat-synchronous audio feature sequences. Next, a novel computational efficient subspace clustering method is proposed, that is coined as ridge representation subspace clustering (RRSC). The performance of the aforementioned three subspace clustering methods is assessed by conducting experiments on the manually annotated Beatles benchmark dataset.

In particular, PDR gracefully adapts the cost of successful data retrieval to the number of Byzantine and crash-stop storage nodes. At the core of PDR is an incremental Reed-Solomon decoding (IRD) procedure that is highly computation efficient for data reconstruction. IRD's computation efficiency arises from its ability to utilize intermediate computation results. In addition, we provide an in-depth analysis of PDR and compare it to decentralized erasure coding and decentralized fountain coding algorithms for distributed storage systems. Moreover, our implementation results show that PDR has up to 35 times lower computation time over the state-of-the-art error-erasure decoding scheme for distributed storage systems. In our analysis, we also show that the code structure of PDR and the number of available storage nodes are independent of each other, and they can be used to control both the data dissemination and retrieval complexity.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152094","Fault tolerance;Reed-Solomon codes;byzantine failure;error control codes","Computer crashes;Decoding;Distributed databases;Encoding;Fault tolerance;Reed Solomon codes","Reed-Solomon codes;decoding;digital storage;information dissemination;information retrieval","Byzantine storage nodes;IRD procedure;PDR mechanism;code structure;crash-stop storage nodes;data dissemination;data reconstruction;decentralized erasure coding algorithms;decentralized fountain coding algorithms;distributed networked storage;in-depth analysis;incremental Reed-Solomon decoding procedure;minimum communication cost;progressive data retrieval","","4","","18","","20120214","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Forest/non-forest mapping accuracies were highest using PALSAR data alone. The combined use of C- and L-band data resulted in higher forest/non-forest mapping accuracies compared to using C-band data alone. Attributed largely to an increased capacity for penetration of the vegetation canopy and interaction with woody structures, L-band SAR is most suited to forest cover mapping.

Software engineers have to go through the whole requirements document and look for the requirements that are affected by a change. Consequently, engineers usually apply changes to the implementation directly and leave requirements unchanged. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically detecting outdated requirements based on changes in the code. Our approach first identifies the changes in the code that are likely to affect requirements. Then it extracts a set of keywords describing the changes. These keywords are traced to the requirements specification, using an existing automated traceability tool, to identify affected requirements. Automatically identifying outdated requirements reduces the effort and time needed for the maintenance of requirements specifications significantly and thus helps preserve the knowledge contained in them. We evaluated our approach in a case study where we analyzed two consecutive source code versions and were able to detect 12 requirements-related changes out of 14 with a precision of 79%. Then we traced a set of keywords we extracted from these changes to the requirements specification. In comparison to simply tracing changed classes to requirements, we got better results in most cases.","1090-705X;1090705X","Electronic:978-1-4673-2785-5; POD:978-1-4673-2783-1","10.1109/RE.2012.6345840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345840","requirements update;software evolution;source code changes;traceability","Context;Documentation;Java;Manuals;Prototypes;Software systems","document handling;formal specification;information retrieval;program diagnostics;software maintenance","automated traceability tool;automatic outdated requirement detection;keyword extraction;outdated requirement identification;requirements document;requirements specification maintenance;source code changes","","9","2","19","","","24-28 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When changes are carried out under tough deadlines, software developers often do not follow software engineering principles, which results in deteriorated structure of the software. A badly structured system is difficult to understand for further changes. To improve structure, re-modularisation may be carried out. Clustering techniques have been used to facilitate automatic re-modularisation. However, clusters produced by clustering algorithms are difficult to comprehend unless they are labelled appropriately. Manual assignment of labels is tiresome, thus efforts should be made towards automatic cluster label assignment. In this study, the authors focus on facilitating comprehension of software clustering results by automatically assigning meaningful labels to clusters. To assign labels, the authors use term weighting schemes borrowed from the domain of information retrieval and text categorisation. Although some term weighting schemes have been used by researchers for software cluster labelling, there is a need to analyse the term weighting schemes and related issues to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these schemes for software cluster labelling. In this context, the authors analyse the behaviour of seven well-known term weighting schemes. Also, they perform the experiments on five software systems to identify software characteristics which affect the labelling behaviour of the term weighting schemes.","1751-8806;17518806","","10.1049/iet-sen.2012.0027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6322850","","","formal specification;formal verification;information retrieval;organisational aspects;pattern clustering;text analysis","automatic cluster label assignment;automatic remodularisation;information retrieval;labels manual assignment;organisations change;software characteristics;software cluster labelling;software clustering algorithm;software developers;software engineering principles;software systems;term weighting schemes;text categorisation","","1","","","","","August 2012","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

For data processing operations, several cloud data managements (CDMs), such as HBase and Cassandra, are developed. Such CDMs usually provide key-value storages, where each key is used to access its corresponding value. Both HBase and Cassandra provide some basic operations (e.g., Get, Scan) to retrieve the values via keys specified by users. The exiting CDMs fully inherit the characteristics of cloud computing (i.e., high scalability and availability). With the aforementioned characteristics of cloud computing, CDMs are widely employed for Web data, especially for search engines. However, with the proliferation of smart phones and location-based services, data with spatial information, referring as spatial data, are dramatically increasing. Consequently, how to formulate keys for spatial data in the existing CDMs is a challenge issue. In this paper, we develop several key formulation schemes. In particular, we propose a novel Key formulation scheme based on R<sup>+</sup>-tree (abbreviated as KR<sup>+</sup>-index). With our design for keys of spatial data, the existing CDMs are able to efficiently retrieve spatial data. In light of KR<sup>+</sup>-tree, two spatial queries, k-NN query and range query, are designed. Moreover, we implement the proposed key formulation schemes on HBase and Cassandra, and import real spatial data for spatial queries. The experimental results demonstrate that KR<sup>+</sup>-tree outperforms other existing key formulations and MD-HBase.","1551-6245;15516245","Electronic:978-1-5090-5639-2; POD:978-1-4673-1796-2; USB:978-0-7695-4713-8","10.1109/MDM.2012.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341370","","Cloud computing;Global Positioning System;Indexing;Scalability;Spatial databases","cloud computing;database management systems;indexing;information retrieval","Cassandra;HBase;Web data;cloud computing scalability;cloud data management;data processing operation;k-NN query;key formulation scheme;key value storage;large scale data analysis;location based services;range query;search engines;smart phones;spatial data retrieval;spatial index;spatial information;spatial queries","","10","","15","","","23-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the impact of coherence traffic and snoop filtering on parallel program scalability has not attracted sufficient attention. We experimentally analyze the shared data access patterns of four typical applications having different memory layout. An OpenMp optimized execution model is derived for each application with emphasis on data dependencies and implied coherence messages. Using an 8-core SMP we present the obtained speedups versus change in the number of cores and problem scale. A discussion of potential limitation on scalability due to the application or SMP is presented. To assess the coherence behavior and its impact on scalability of parallel programs, a synthetic benchmark which alternates the data block ownership among two cores of the same or different processors is presented. It is found that coherence overheads including snoop filtering are responsible of significant limitation on parallel program scalability. For 8-core SMPs, speedup can be reduced by factors of 2.5 and 5 for row-major and column-major access patterns as compared to the use of private data, respectively.

This style of service provisioning enables users to freely move between geographical areas and to continuously access information and conduct online transactions. However, such a high mobility may cause performance and reliability problems during the execution of transactions. For example, the unavailability of sufficient bandwidth can result in failure of transactions when users move from one area (cell) to another. We present a context-aware transaction model that dynamically adapts to the users' needs and execution environments. Accordingly, we develop a new mobility management scheme that ensures seamless connectivity and reliable execution of context-aware transactions during mobility of users. The proposed scheme is designed and developed using a combination of different queuing models.

"Mixed scheme based multimodal medical image fusion using Daubechies Complex Wavelet Transform","R. Singh; R. Srivastava; O. Prakash; A.

Image fusion can be performed using either spatial or transform domain methods. Limitations of spatial domain fusion methods led to transform domain methods. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based fusion is one of the most widely used transform domain method. But it suffers from shift sensitivity and does not provide any phase information. These disadvantages of DWT motivated us to use complex wavelet transform. In the present work, we have proposed a new multimodal medical image fusion method using Daubechies complex wavelet transform (DCxWT) which applies two separate fusion rules for approximation and detail coefficients. Shift invariance, availability of phase information and multiscale edge information properties of DCxWT improves the quality of fused image. We have compared the proposed method with spatial domain fusion methods (PCA and linear fusion) and transform domain fusion methods (discrete and lifting wavelet transforms). Comparison of results has been done qualitatively as well as by using different fusion metrics (entropy, standard deviation, fusion factor, fusion symmetry and Q<sub>AB</sub><sup>F</sup>). On the basis of qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained results, the proposed method is found to be better than spatial domain fusion methods (PCA and linear fusion) and transform domain fusion methods (discrete and lifting wavelet transforms).","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1154-0; POD:978-1-4673-1153-3","10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6317394","","Biology;Biomedical imaging;Discrete wavelet transforms;Multiresolution analysis;Wavelet domain","biomedical MRI;discrete wavelet transforms;entropy;image fusion;image retrieval;information retrieval;medical image processing;sensitivity","Daubechies complex wavelet transform;MRI;complementary information retrieval;complex wavelet transform;discrete wavelet transform based fusion;entropy;fusion factor;fusion metrics;fusion symmetry;lifting wavelet transforms;mixed scheme based multimodal medical image fusion;multiscale edge information properties;phase information;qualitative analysis;quantitative analysis;shift sensitivity;spatial domain methods;standard deviation;transform domain methods","","8","","24","","","18-19 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet, the data access patterns of LBS typically possess spatial locality. Therefore, a dedicated spatial cache which provides efficient access to the data currently needed may considerably reduce this load. To ensure high throughput throughout the entire execution, previous work introduced an elastic load-balancing mechanism for multiple cache nodes that collaborate in a distributed spatial cache overlay. However, calibrating such a load-balancing mechanism is a non-trivial task, as several parameters influence such a system. We demonstrate a simulation platform (SimPl) for elastic load-balancing. SimPl enables a network administrator to set up several overlay topologies and calibrate their system parameters using different spatial data access patterns.

In the present study, we verified whether the CRR's learning ability influenced the efficiency with which children acquire new knowledge. We conducted a field experiment in an actual classroom at an English language school for Japanese children. The target participants were children between 4-8 years old who attended the school. The participants attempted drawing various shapes along with the robot in order to enhance their knowledge of English words for these shapes (drawing game). The experiment was carried out under three conditions of the CRR's learning ability as follows: an excellent robot that could answer all the questions correctly; a CRR that was capable of learning; and a CRR that was not capable of learning at all. From the experiment, it was found that the CRR that was capable of learning helped children learn unknown English words for shapes. In addition, correct demonstrations by the robot had a greater impact than that had been expected on children's learning ability.

However, the screen constraints on mobile devices significantly increases the mode-switching between panning and zooming when trying to retrieve map data which negatively affects the user experience. The Anchored Zoom (AZ) is one of the techniques that have been proposed to overcome this problem, but it has some limitations concerning the use of its anchor point, i.e. a point of reference that serves as a major tool to control zooming in this technique. This paper presents the Anchored Zoom with Anchor Management (AZAM), a new technique that extends AZ by adding an anchor management to it, i.e., by adding new features that better exploit the use of anchors, improving the choice of new anchors and access to the previous ones. We evaluated both techniques, AZ and AZAM, and we also investigated their relevance in comparison with the popular Pinch to Zoom (PZ) technique. The study reveals that AZAM is superior to AZ in perceived satisfaction and that it serves as a complement to PZ during visual search tasks.","0730-3157;07303157","Electronic:978-1-5090-5637-8; POD:978-1-4673-1990-4; USB:978-0-7695-4736-7","10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6340215","automatic zoom;map navigation;mobile interaction;mobile map-based applications","Context;Fingers;Image color analysis;Mobile communication;Navigation;Standards;Switches","cartography;information retrieval;mobile computing;screens (display)","AZ;AZAM;PZ technique;anchor point;anchored navigation;anchored zoom with anchor management;map-based services;mobile devices;mobile maps;mode-switching;panning;perceived satisfaction;pinch to zoom technique;screen constraints;visual search tasks;zooming","","0","","16","","","16-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we develop a method to systematically aggregate the web pages into groups by exploiting the sparsity inherent in the web. For each group, an aggregated PageRank value is computed, which can then be distributed among the group members. We provide a distributed update scheme for the aggregated PageRank along with an analysis on its convergence properties.

These programs are planned according to the type and degree of the disorder, age, characteristics, and needs of the children. Families prefer Internet to search resources about related educational methods (and associated activity/game) and materials. However, syntactic search in today's Internet is insufficient because of its static base and the search results are not sufficient enough to offer desired relevant results corresponding to a child's needs. With the help of Semantic Web-based agents an intelligent system able to identify the suitable educational methods and material, will contribute to the development of children with disorders, and support education specialists in this process. In addition it will be extremely useful for the families of these children in need of assisting and monitoring their child's development. In this article, an Educational Activity Finder (EAF) is being proposed. The architecture of EAF is structured after semantic Web technology so that it can find and propose semantically relevant suitable educational methods (i.e., activities to carry out) and material for use by children with disorders. The knowledge base of EAF keeps educational methods using the OWL language. All related concepts, attributes, and relations between these concepts and features about pervasive developmental disorders are defined through ontology. EAF is structured to recognize a pervasive developmental disorder, sort out symptoms and anomalies, suggest activities, compile performance scores, and decide on new activity based on user preferences by utilizing the semantic descriptions of available methods and activities. Strength of EAF is demonstrated through sample scenarios. EAF may be used by parents, pre-school educators, primary schools, special educational institutions and experts working for these institutions, university stude- ts studying in related fields, and individuals interested in pervasive developmental disorders.","0730-3157;07303157","Electronic:978-1-5090-5637-8; POD:978-1-4673-1990-4; USB:978-0-7695-4736-7","10.1109/COMPSAC.2012.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6340200","Asperger's Syndrome;Atypical Autism;Autism;Disintegrative Disorder of Childhood;Ontology;Pervasive Developmental Disorders;Rett Syndrome;Semantic Search Systems;Semantic Web","Autism;Educational activities;Educational institutions;Games;Ontologies;Semantics","educational institutions;handicapped aids;information retrieval;knowledge representation languages;medical disorders;multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","EAF architecture;EAF knowledge base;Internet;OWL language;anomaly sorting;child age;child characteristics;child development assistance;child development monitoring;child needs;education program planning;education specialists;educational activity;educational activity finder;educational game;educational institutions;educational materials;intelligent system;parents;performance score compilation;pervasive developmental disorder children;preschool educators;primary schools;semantic Web-based agents;semantic resource search system;symptom sorting;university students;user preferences","","0","","12","","","16-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the existing approaches for mining these behavior patterns are not practical in mobile environments due to limited computing resources on mobile devices. To fulfill this crucial void, we investigate optimizing strategies which can be used for improving the efficiency of behavior pattern mining in terms of computing and memory needs. Specifically, we examine typical optimizing strategies for association rule mining and study the feasibility of applying them to behavior pattern mining, since these two problems are similar in many aspects. Moreover, we develop an efficient algorithm, named BP-Growth, for behavior pattern mining by combining two promising strategies. Finally, experimental results show that BP-Growth outperforms benchmark methods with a significant margin in terms of both computing and memory cost.","1551-6245;15516245","Electronic:978-1-5090-5639-2; POD:978-1-4673-1796-2; USB:978-0-7695-4713-8","10.1109/MDM.2012.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341395","behavior pattern mining;optimizing strategies","Association rules;Context;Itemsets;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets","behavioural sciences computing;data mining;human computer interaction;information retrieval;mobile computing;mobile radio","BP-growth;association rule mining;behavior pattern growth;mobile device;mobile user;optimizing strategy;personalized intelligence service;searching strategy;user behavior pattern mining;user habit mining;user interaction;user understanding","","4","","14","","","23-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A set of metadata elements from ISO19115 are selected and their searching and usage strategies are developed. The standardized metadata helps to improve the searching efficiency by adding constraints for intelligently filtering data that matches the characteristics of the reference RS data.

We used an eye tracker to better understand why participants with a variant of a tabular visualization called `SimulSort' outperformed ones with a conventional table and typical one-column sorting feature (i.e., Typical Sorting). The collected eye-tracking data certainly shed light on the detailed cognitive processes of the participants; SimulSort helped with decision-making tasks by promoting efficient browsing behavior and compensatory decision-making strategies. However, more interestingly, we also found unexpected eye-tracking patterns with Simul- Sort. We investigated the cause of the unexpected patterns through a crowdsourcing-based study (i.e., Experiment 2), which elicited an important limitation of the eye tracking method: incapability of capturing peripheral vision. This particular result would be a caveat for other visualization researchers who plan to use an eye tracker in their studies. In addition, the method to use a testing stimulus (i.e., influential column) in Experiment 2 to verify the existence of such limitations would be useful for researchers who would like to verify their eye tracking results.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327247","Visualized decision making;crowdsourcing;eye tracking;limitations;peripheral vision;quantitative empirical study","Crowdsourcing;Data visualization;Decision making;Market research;Research and development;Tracking","cognitive systems;data visualisation;decision making;eye;information retrieval","SimulSort;browsing behavior;cognitive process;decision making;eye movements;eye tracker;information visualization;peripheral vision;tabular visualization","0","8","","55","","","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As part of the activities of Coming Home, we implemented an ambitious storytelling activity that reinforces the positive ideals for which a warrior stands, by presenting historical figures from the past that illustrate those qualities. The storytelling includes scenes from a warrior's life, and a conversational avatar agent that can answer questions about the historical parts of the story.

Although visualized and experienced in world, the authoring tools and repository for most of the narrative content are web-based.

The main difficulty in building a KB for a chat bot is to handwrite all possible question-answer pairs that constitute the KB. The proposed approach simplifies the chat bot realization thanks to two solutions. The first one uses an ontology, which is exploited in a twofold manner: to construct dynamic answers as a result of an inference process about the domain, and to automatically populate, off-line, the chat bot KB with sentences that can be derived from the ontology, describing properties and relations between concepts involved in the dialogue. The second one is to preprocess user sentences, and to reduce them to a simpler structure that can be referred to existing elements of the chat bot KB. The enhanced symbolic reduction of user questions and the automatic population of question templates in the chat bot KB from domain ontology have been implemented as two computational services (external modules).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4859-3; POD:978-1-4673-4433-3","10.1109/ICSC.2012.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337103","","Engines;Knowledge based systems;Natural languages;Ontologies;Pattern matching;Semantics;Standards","inference mechanisms;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;question answering (information retrieval);semantic networks;user interfaces","FRASI project;chatbot semantic maintainability;chatbot semantic power;computational services;domain ontology;domain-oriented question-answering system;enhanced symbolic reduction;industrial project;inference process;pattern-matching chat bot technology;semantic enhancement;user sentence preprocessing","","2","","19","","","19-21 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If we develop a website that automatically collects such questions and asks for answers, other people who know the answers to these questions can respond efficiently. Hence, we have developed a method to semi-automatically collect questions from blogs and tweets, and we have built a website to display these questions. The proposed data collection method consists of two steps: (1) submission of words (to a search engine) that are characteristic to questions in order to obtain blog articles and tweets that are likely to contain questions, and (2) the use of automatic text classification to extract articles and tweets containing the questions. Through step (1), we extract characteristic words from 400 articles and tweets. In step (2), we adopt four classification methods (support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, decision tree, and boosting) and compare their effectiveness by using 1,900 articles and tweets. It is found that (1) the characteristic words ""taitoru-ga-omoidase-nai"" produce the best precision (16% for Google Blog Search and 13% for Twitter Search) and (2) boosting and decision tree methods produce the best classification for blogs and Twitter (their F values are 0.943 and 0.941, respectively).

During both work and leisure, we increasingly interact with information spaces that contain multiple facets and relations, such as authors, keywords, and citations of academic publications, or actors and genres of movies. To navigate these interlinked resources today, one typically selects items from facet lists resulting in abrupt changes from one subset of data to another. While filtering is useful to retrieve results matching specific criteria, it can be difficult to see how facets and items relate and to comprehend the effect of filter operations. In contrast, the PivotPaths interface exposes faceted relations as visual paths in arrangements that invite the viewer to `take a stroll' through an information space. PivotPaths supports pivot operations as lightweight interaction techniques that trigger gradual transitions between views. We designed the interface to allow for casual traversal of large collections in an aesthetically pleasing manner that encourages exploration and serendipitous discoveries. This paper shares the findings from our iterative design-and-evaluation process that included semi-structured interviews and a two-week deployment of PivotPaths applied to a large database of academic publications.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327277","Information visualization;animation;exploratory search;information seeking;interactivity;node-link diagrams","Context;Facial animation;Information services;Layout;Motion pictures;Navigation;Visualization","information filters;information resources;information retrieval","PivotPaths;academic publications;facet lists;faceted information resources;filter operations;interactive visualization;iterative design-and-evaluation process","","36","","24","","","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Another crucial issue to increase the semantic aspect of web is to enrich the level of expressivity of database related data. Nowadays, databases are the primary source of information for dynamical web sites. The linguistic data used to build the database structure could be relevant for extracting meaningful information. In most cases, this type of information is not used for information retrieval. The work presented in this paper deals with an attempt to enrich a database structure using linguistic information. The purpose is twofold: the proposed approach can be used either to validate the database structure linguistically or at least to enrich information retrieval with structural information.

This paper introduces a QoS framework for flash based storage arrays. Our framework provides deterministic and statistical response time guarantees through a combination of techniques including replication, data mining, and online retrieval. We evaluated the framework using synthetic and real-world traces. The QoS performance of the system is compared to the existing high-throughput RAID designs. Numerical results show that under the synthetic traces, QoS performance of the proposed system outperforms the existing high performance RAID designs.

The mentioned method which is named TagAssessment computes the figure of relationship between the contents and the user's tags and utilizes the obtained results for learner assessment. In this regard, the semantic distance between the tags associated to the content, and the concepts covered by the same content is calculated using WordNet tree ontology. In the evaluation process, ninety learners were asked to place their tags on the contents related to a BSc course to create a data set for further evaluation.

Although, some ones conclude acceptable results, the incidence of noise and silence affect severely the pertinence of returned results. The indexing process produce at the end set of independents terms (bag of words), without any semantic relationship. Our work proposes an approach to perform semantic annotation.

In this paper, a novel support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is used in Web mining, in order to find potential customers who visit the Web sites. And those potential customers are divided into two classes. Support Vector Machine (SVM) constructs an optimal hyperplane utilizing a small set of vectors near boundary. However, when the two-class problem samples are very unbalanced, PSVM tends to fit better the class with more samples and has high error in the class with fewer samples. To address the problem, an improved SVM algorithm, DFP-PSVM is presented in this paper.

Information-intensive university search plays an important role in making a successful eco-system that can positively empower the inter-disciplines and cooperative potential of the university management, academic staff members, researchers and students. This can be achieved through adaptive, personalized, context-aware information dissemination program tool. This paper presents a novel application of smart location-based services for developing a smart university Geographic Information System (GIS) solution based on mobile and wireless network technologies. The proposed approach allows users to conduct search at the university campus based on GIS as well as supporting the regular search to identify researchers and departmental Information content, activities, projects, services, tools, knowledge, events, etc. It allows users to select among three search options that are; keyword-based search, location-based search, and user profile-based search. The novel approach described in this paper combines users mobility, including their location, with the adaptive user profile or selected keyword search to determine researchers and departments profiles, and displaying the relevant result on user's terminals dynamically. The user mobile location is determined according to the IP sub-netting at the university campus as an alternative to Global Positioning System (GPS) solution in order to provide an easy and flexible solution for establishing a social and professional network among university researchers and stakeholders.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1520-3; POD:978-1-4673-1518-0","10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6320141","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6320141","Context-aware;Database;Eco-system;Location-based Services;University Smart GIS","Adaptive systems;Buildings;Context-aware services;Databases;Educational institutions;Geographic information systems;Mobile communication","IP networks;educational administrative data processing;educational institutions;geographic information systems;information dissemination;information retrieval;mobile computing;radio networks","GIS;GPS;Global Positioning System;IP subnetting;SCASUC;academic environment;academic staff members;adaptive user profile;context-aware information dissemination program tool;information-intensive university search;keyword search selection;keyword-based search;location-based search;mobile network technology;profile-based search;researchers;science park stakeholder;smart and context aware search for university campus;smart location-based services;smart university geographic information system solution;students;university management;users mobility;wireless network technology","","0","","20","","","10-12 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a new method in extracting semantic feature for 3D model is proposed. It can get high-level semantic information automatically from low-level. First, invariant descriptors are extracted from 3D models to efficient semantic annotation. An unsupervised learning method to describe the semantics of the 3D models is proposed. Second, and based on the resulting semantic annotation, 3D models are semantically classified. Finally, spatial relationships are used to derive other high-level semantic features to augment our knowledge base and to improve the retrieval accuracy.

In this paper, we depart from the traditional document search paradigm to move onto the construction of a collection navigation strategy. We thus detail a model where user clicks are taken as expression of interest rather than positive search feedback. In terms of the interpretation of user interaction, our model is close to the recommendation paradigm. However, it exploits user feedback in a navigational procedure to perform an approximation of interactive metric learning procedures. Our model is directly compatible with distributed data indexing and is therefore inherently built to cope with scalability issues. The evaluation of such models is discussed and implemented over the context of an image collection. Experiments are presented where the user browses a collection of images with changing center of focus in the course of the browsing operations. Results show that our model is effectively able to recommend the user a relevant path through the collection and to adapt according to variable expressed interests.","1529-4188;15294188","Electronic:978-0-7695-4801-2; POD:978-1-4673-2621-6","10.1109/DEXA.2012.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327407","Mumtimedia navigation;information processing;recommendation;user interaction","Adaptation models;Conferences;Context;History;Indexing;Measurement;Navigation","approximation theory;document image processing;information retrieval;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems","SwiftLink;adaptive access strategies;approximation;browsing operations;collection navigation strategy;distributed data indexing;document search paradigm;image collection;interactive metric learning procedures;large-scale document collections;positive search feedback;recommendation paradigm;serendipitous navigation strategy;user feedback","","0","","24","","","3-7 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, the point cloud data that obtained by this system are dense and very huge. Secondly, if we just use one 3D index, we can not search the three-dimensional cloud-points effectively. A method is researched that knowledge of common 3D index and the characteristic of three-dimensional cloud-points is represented by object oriental technique and that the mixed indexing models are derived by inference, and then, the mixed indexing model of octree and R+ tree is built and used for three-dimensional cloud-points searching.

However, the efficiency of database searching is facing a serious challenge, due to the ever fast growth of protein and peptide databases resulted from genome translations, enzymatic digestions, and post-translational modifications (PTMs). On the other hand, as a general-purpose and high performance parallel hardware, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) develop continuously and provide another promising platform for parallelizing database searching based protein identification. It becomes very important to study how to speed up database search engines by GPUs for protein identification. In this paper, we mainly utilize GPUs to accelerate the scoring module, which is the most time-consuming component. Specifically, we study two popular scoring method: spectral dot product based method, which is used by X!Tandem, and kernel spectral dot product, which is used by pFind.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4749-7; POD:978-1-4673-2164-8","10.1109/HPCC.2012.194","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332330","GPU computing;protein identification;spectral dot product","Databases;Graphics processing unit;Kernel;Peptides;Proteins;Search engines;Vectors","genomics;graphics processing units;information retrieval;mass spectroscopy;medical information systems;parallel processing;proteins;proteomics;search engines","GPU;PTM;X!Tandem;database search engines;database searching-based protein identification parallelization;enzymatic digestions;general-purpose parallel hardware;genome translations;graphics processing units;high-performance parallel hardware;kernel spectral dot product;mass spectrometry-based protein identification;pFind;peptide databases;posttranslational modifications;protein databases;scoring module;shotgun proteomics;spectral dot product-based method","","0","","35","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fusion schemes include linear, adaptive and nonlinear methods. A machine learning approach, where training of the features is performed, was also applied for the purpose of comparison with the proposed technique. For the evaluation of the algorithm we use audio data taken from movies and we show that nonlinear fusion schemes perform best. The results are reported on the MovSum database, using objective evaluations (against ground-truth denoting the perceptually important audio events). Analysis of the selected audio segments is also performed against a labeled database in respect to audio categories, while a method for fine-tuning of the selected audio events is proposed.","2219-5491;22195491","Electronic:978-1-5090-5635-4; POD:978-1-4673-1068-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6334317","audio summarization;modulation model;monomodal audio saliency","Computational modeling;Databases;Event detection;Feature extraction;Frequency modulation;Motion pictures;Speech","audio databases;audio streaming;classification;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);modulation;sensor fusion","MovSum database;adaptive method;audio categories;audio data;audio event detection;audio segment selection;audio streams;audio summarization problem;labeled database;linear method;machine learning;modulation model;nonlinear fusion schemes;nonlinear methods;saliency-based approach","","1","","9","","","27-31 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
