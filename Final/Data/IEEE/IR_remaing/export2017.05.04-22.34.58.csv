By using the proposed architecture, the viewers will be able to see the real world interaction devices and control them through interactive applications using specific APIs to each broadcast system. So this approach is able to manage the devices in the network despite of the physical layer used to communicate, allowing them to communicate to each other and to be controlled by external applications. Afterwards, by using the architecture, we can allow viewers to control or access data from entities which compound the network through distributed communication processes and control applications.

Many internet users are not only information consumers but also information providers. There are lots of information in the Web and most people can find what they want by searching the Web. One problem of the large number of data in the Web is that we often spend most of our time to find a correct result from search results. Thus, people start looking for a better system that can suggest relevant information instead of letting users go through all search results: We call such systems recommendation systems. A recommendation system is often based on collaborative filtering (CF). A traditional CF approach requires lots if user data so that a recommendation system can compute the similarity of user preferences and suggest items based on the computed preferences between users. This approach has two problems: sparsity and cold start. We propose a different CF approach based on the category correlation of contents. First, we show how to compute the category correlations of contents. Then, we design a new recommendation algorithm based on the category correlations to a user with certain preferences. Note that our approach does not require computing the preference similarity between users.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4181-5; POD:978-1-4244-8068-5","10.1109/ICCGI.2010.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5628890","category correlation;collaborative filtering;recommendation system","Collaboration;Correlation;Databases;Equations;Filtering;Mathematical model;Motion pictures","Internet;information retrieval;recommender systems","Internet;Web 2.0;category correlations;collaborative filtering;content recommendation system;preference similarity;user preferences","","3","","10","","","20-25 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of information technology by the government, business corporations, academic institutions, and the general public results in staggering amounts of digital-born materials requiring long-term preservation and access. Organizations in different domains have to cope with the daunting task of storing and providing access to the growing amount of digital data. In many cases data heterogeneity, which ranges from office automation and geospatial images, to multimedia artifacts, adds to the challenge. In response to these challenges, we propose a Content Server Architecture Pattern. Content Server Architecture Pattern can be applied for instantiation of data-centric architecture, service-centric architecture, storage technology-centric architecture or an architecture that is some hybrid of that set to implement a Content Server Repository portion of a digital preservation system.

Moreover, heuristics, a simplified information research method, is proposed to extend information searches. 500 investors with investment experiment from financial holding companies were surveyed and structural equation modeling was employed. We expected that the results could provide empirical support for (1) greatly expanding our understanding for the heuristics reliance in information search, and (2) validating the usefulness of the mediated model which views information search as a mediator of effects on higher risk investment preferences, especially in the mediating role of professional advice and heuristics.

Different from previous approaches that have mostly treated product feature and opinion extraction as two independent tasks, we merge them together in a unified process by using probabilistic models. Specifically, we treat the problem of product feature and opinion extraction as a sequence labeling task and adopt Conditional Random Fields models to accomplish it. As part of our work, we develop a computational approach to construct domain specific sentiment lexicon by combining semi-structured reviews with general sentiment lexicon, which helps to identify the sentiment orientations of opinions.

Automatic Metadata Generation (AMG) algorithms could perform similar metadata generation efforts in seconds without the need for human efforts. Submission of conference proceedings commonly includes specifying an extensive range of metadata. Conference proceedings are based on a specific document template with strict usage regulations making them a prime candidate for AMG efforts. This paper evaluates usage of AMG to generate metadata from papers based the MS Word-based IEEE & ACM conference proceedings templates. This enables this research to evaluate if the templates enable efficient AMG efforts, and if the desired paper content is actually retrieved.

Zero hits are naturally undesirable, while too many hits are likely to be overwhelming and of low precision. We present an approach for predicting the number of hits for a given set of query terms. Using word frequencies derived from a large corpus, we construct random samples of combinations of these words as search terms. Then we derive a correlation function between the computed probabilities of search terms and the observed hit counts for them. This regression function is used to predict the hit counts for a user's new searches, with the intention of avoiding information overload. We report the results of experiments with Google, Yahoo! and Bing to validate our methodology. We further investigate the monotonicity of search results for negative search terms by those three search engines.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4191-4; POD:978-1-4244-8482-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616242","","","Internet;content-based retrieval;information retrieval;regression analysis;search engines","Bing;Google;Web search hit count;Yahoo;keyword-based search engine;query term;regression function","","1","1","21","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, this task can be approached by applying domain specific ontologies, but a review of the literature shows that there is no universal dictionary, or ontology for this domain. To address this issue, we manually construct an ontology for extracting entities such as: animal disease names, viruses and serotypes. We then use an automated ontology expansion approach to extract semantic relationships between concepts. Such relationships include asserted synonymy, hyponymy and causality. Specifically, these relationships are extracted by using a set of syntactic patterns and part-of-speech tagging. The resulting ontology contains richer semantics compared to the manually constructed ontology. We compare our approach for extracting synonyms, hyponyms and other disease related concepts, with an approach where the ontology is expanded using GoogleSets, on the veterinary medicine entity extraction task. Experimental results show that our semantic relationship extraction approach produces a significant increase in precision and recall as compared to the GoogleSets approach.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4191-4; POD:978-1-4244-8482-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616554","entity extraction;semantic relation discovery;text mining","","diseases;document handling;information networks;information retrieval;medical computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);veterinary medicine","Googlesets approach;asserted synonymy;automated ontology expansion;biomedical entity extraction;part of speech tagging;semantic relation discovery;syntactic pattern;universal dictionary;unstructured Web document;veterinary medicine domain","","0","","22","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To organize this information and make it accessible via current search technology, tagging systems have gained tremendous popularity. Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords (tags) which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval. To support the user in choosing the right keywords, tag recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this setting, not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the user's preferences. In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user. As models we investigate simple language models as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extensive experiments on a real world dataset crawled from a big tagging system show that personalization improves tag recommendation, and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4191-4; POD:978-1-4244-8482-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616206","Clustering;Data mining;Personalization","","Internet;data mining;information retrieval;probability;recommender systems;text analysis","Web;data mining;language models;latent Dirichlet allocation;probabilistic model;search technology;tag recommendation algorithms;tagging system;tagging systems;text-based information retrieval;topic models","","3","","27","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wikipedia is a goldmine of information; not just for its many readers, but also for the growing community of researchers who recognize it as a resource of exceptional scale and utility. It represents a vast investment of manual effort and judgment: a huge, constantly evolving tapestry of concepts and relations that is being applied to a host of tasks. This talk focuses on the process of ""wikification""; that is, automatically and judiciously augmenting a plain-text document with pertinent hyperlinks to Wikipedia articles as though the document were itself a Wikipedia article. I first describe how Wikipedia can be used to determine semantic relatedness between concepts. Then I explain how to wikify documents by exploiting Wikipedia's internal hyperlinks for relational information and their anchor texts as lexical information. Data mining techniques are used throughout to optimize the models involved. I will discuss applications to knowledge-based information retrieval, topic indexing, document tagging, and document clustering. Some of these perform at human levels. For example, on CiteULike data, automatically extracted tags are competitive with tag sets assigned by the best human taggers, according to a measure of consistency with other human taggers. All this work uses English, but involves no syntactic parsing, so the techniques are language independent.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4191-4; POD:978-1-4244-8482-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615840","","","data mining;document handling;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;pattern clustering;search engines","CiteULike data;Wikipedia internal hyperlinks;data mining techniques;document clustering;document tagging;knowledge-based information retrieval;lexical information;relational information;semantic document representation;topic indexing","","0","","","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two main types of overlay topologies: structured and unstructured. The unstructured networks have excessive lookup costs, while the structured networks have many restraints between the shared data placement and topology characteristics of P2P networks. Hybrid peer-to-peer (P2P) networks that construct overlay topology structured among several super-peers who have great potential in that they can give the benefits such as search efficiency, latency and network traffic, and organize normal peers unstructured, can combine the advantages of structured and unstructured overlay networks. In this paper, a hybrid P2P overlay topology is designed. The major goal of the design is to enhance the efficiency of P2P search. To do so, the proposed hybrid P2P overlay consists of an unstructured overlay and a structured overlay based on tree and ring which can facilitate reliable and efficient message dissemination for search. Experimental results show that compared to the unstructured P2P overlay topology, the hybrid topology proposed here can perform much better in success rate and message overhead, especially for rare resources.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6928-4; POD:978-1-4244-6927-7","10.1109/ICIFE.2010.5609293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5609293","efficiency;overhead;peer-to-peer (P2P) network;search;super-peer","Distributed databases;Fault tolerance;Maintenance engineering;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Topology","information dissemination;information retrieval;network topology;peer-to-peer computing;search problems;trees (mathematics)","high efficient search;hybrid P2P network;message dissemination;overlay topology;peer to peer research;structured overlay network;unstructured overlay network","","2","","17","","","17-19 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then describe a formal model through which users can retrieve object-oriented data. The retrieved data is then directly associated with record or aggregate templates to be visualized.

In this paper, we propose to improve the basic topic detection model by combining domain knowledge. The domain knowledge can be automatically extracted from a collection of external knowledge sources and applied to the content analysis of the threads. Two approaches, i.e. the LDA and the Concept Mapping, are proposed to implement the knowledge extraction and integration.

In our system a user can perform an ordinary keyword search and browse relevant pages but is also given the ability to broaden the search to more general topics and narrow it to more specific topics.

As there are many natural language processing tasks which can be improved by applying disambiguation to the text, fast and high quality tagging algorithms are a crucial task in information retrieval and question answering. Tagging aims to assigning to each word of a text its correct tag according to the context in which the word is used. Part Of Speech (POS) tagging is a difficult problem by itself, since many words has a number of possible tags associated to it. In this paper we present a novel algorithm that deals with POS-tagging problem based on Harmony Search (HS) optimization method. This paper analyzes the relative advantages of HS metaheuristic approache to the well-known natural language processing problem of POS-tagging. In the experiments we conducted, we applied the proposed algorithm on linguistic corpora and compared the results obtained against other optimization methods such as genetic and simulated annealing algorithms.

However, most of current systems suffer the following problems: (1) Constructing the mappings between documents and concepts in ontology requires the training of robust hierarchical classifiers; it's difficult to build such classifiers for large-scale documents corpus due to the time-efficiency and precision issues. (2) The traditional Browsing Hierarchical System ignores the distribution of documents over concepts, which is not realistic when a large number of documents distributed biasly on certain concepts. Browsing documents such concepts becomes time-consuming and unpractical for users. Therefore, further splitting these concepts into sub-categories is necessary and critical for organizing documents in the browsing system. Aiming at building the Hierarchical Browsing System more realistically and accurately, we propose an adaptive Hierarchical Browsing System framework in this paper, which is designed to build a Browsing Hierarchy for CiteSeer<sup>x</sup>. In this framework, we first investigate the supervised learning approaches to classify documents into existing predefined concepts of ontology and compare their performance on different datasets of CiteSeer<sup>x</sup>.

That is, to recommend products that the end-user likes, but that are not generally popular. To achieve this goal, in this paper we propose two strategies to identify relevant but niche products. The first strategy computes an inverse item popularity and applies it during the steps of top-N recommendation. Given a prior probability distribution of relevance based on item popularity, and a user-specific relevance probability, the other strategy uses a number of scores based on distance measures between these two distributions. We emphasize that the problem is to recommend relevant items from the user's broader range of tastes. Hence, in evaluation a concentration index is calculated to measure the extent to which the recommendation is spread to the user's niche tastes in conjunction with the standard precision metric which measures the overall relevance of the recommended set. The methods are evaluated empirically using the Movielens dataset and show a strong performance in niche item retrieval at the cost of a small reduction in precision.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4191-4; POD:978-1-4244-8482-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616197","long-tail;popularity discount;probability distribution;top-N recommendation","","customer satisfaction;information retrieval;personal computing;recommender systems;statistical distributions","Movielens dataset;end-user;niche item retrieval;niche product retrieval;personalised recommender system;probability distribution;standard precision metric;top-N recommendation;user-specific relevance probability","","2","","19","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An event-related fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) experiment was conducted on a simplified Sudoku puzzle problem solving and an ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) cognitive model was developed to simulate the information processing processes of heuristics retrieval to solve the problems. We assume that when participants retrieve heuristics, they may conform to a principle of maximizing the information effectiveness and minimizing the cognitive cost. Based on the assumption, the model was built to predict both behavioral performance and neurophysiologic activities. Compared ACT-R predictions with fMRI results, the difference on response time is 0.287 and the average correlation of BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent) response between them is about 0.95. The high fitness supports our assumption. This study shows that heuristics retrieving in human problem solving is an optimizing process in which appropriate information is selected actively through visual selective attention based on goal-oriented to minimize the cost of time and energy. It may shed light on developing a new heuristic search model based on cognition for Web intelligence.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4191-4; POD:978-1-4244-8482-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616173","","","biomedical MRI;information retrieval;problem solving","ACT-R cognitive model;Sudoku puzzle problem solving;Web intelligence;adaptive control of thought-rational;blood oxygenation level-dependent;computational cognitive model;event-related fMRI;functional magnetic resonance imaging;heuristics retrieval;human problem solving;neuro imaging","","0","","17","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inferring the reason for each tag helps TAM reduce the ambiguity of a document with multiple tags. By introducing noise as a reason, TAM can handle noise tags naturally.

The three pillars of the system consist of prior knowledge, environment model and sensory information. The main pillar is the environment model, which supplies the autonomous system with relevant information about its current environment. For this purpose, an abstract representation of the real world is created, where instances with attributes and relations serve as virtual substitutes of entities (persons and objects) of the real world. The environment model is created based on sensory information about the real world. The gathered sensory information is typically uncertain in a stochastic sense and is represented in the environment model by means of Degree-of-Belief (DoB) distributions. The prior knowledge contains all relevant background knowledge (e. g., concepts organized in ontologies) for creating and maintaining the environment model. The concept of the three pillar information system has previously been published. Therefore this contribution focuses on further central properties of the system. Furthermore, the development status and possible applications as well as evaluation scenarios are discussed.","1944-9429;19449429","Electronic:978-1-4244-5905-6; POD:978-1-4244-5904-9","10.1109/VECIMS.2010.5609350","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5609350","","Humanoid robots;Humans;Information systems;Object oriented modeling;Ontologies;Robot sensing systems","information management;information retrieval systems","autonomous systems;degree-of-belief distributions;environment model;information storage system;pillar information management system;sensory information","","1","","17","","","6-8 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, real-world entities are identified and the relevance of documents is determined using relationships that are known to exist between the entities in a populated ontology. We introduce a measure of relevance that is based on traversal and the semantics of relationships that link entities in an ontology.

In the Vietnamese writing system, most of vowels have diacritical signs. With this special feature, secret information can be embedded into Vietnamese documents by slightly shifting up/down and left/right these signs. The embedded documents are nearly the same as the original ones, and so the reader could not find any differences by eyes. Secret information can be extracted for many purposes such as copyright protection, tampering detection, etc. However, extracting embedded information is a really complicated task. In this paper, we propose a solution to apply Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for effectively extracting hidden information from embedded Vietnamese documents.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8075-3; POD:978-1-4244-8074-6","10.1109/RIVF.2010.5633363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633363","","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Character recognition;Data mining;Feature extraction;Matrix converters;Watermarking","document image processing;information retrieval;neural nets","Vietnamese document image;Vietnamese writing system;artificial neural network;embedded Vietnamese document;hidden information extraction","","0","","26","","","1-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a novel approach to integrating user interests into search within a recommender system that is guided by the semantic representation of the user and the content. In addition, our research tackles two problems of creating any recommender system: (a) the initial stage problem (how to provide recommendations to a user if the system hasn't been used yet) and (b) user context (providing the same user with different recommendations based on the context of their recent activity). Also the design of our recommender system is modular. It integrates and accommodates user's preferences by using User Relevance Feedback. Finally, we describe how the personalization aspects can increase the recommendation quality.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4191-4; POD:978-1-4244-8482-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616263","ontology;recommender search engine;semantic;user relevance feedback","","information retrieval;recommender systems;search engines;semantic Web;user centred design","personalized search engine;semantic representation;user centered recommender engine;user context;user interest;user relevance feedback","","2","","14","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this way it is possible to assess the performance of an approach to opinion mining from that of the overall system and to clarify how relevance and opinion are affected by each other.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4191-4; POD:978-1-4244-8482-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.272","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5614090","evaluation methodologies;opinion retrieval;topic-sentiment analysis","Accuracy;Information services;Internet;Monte Carlo methods;NIST;Special issues and sections;Web sites","Monte Carlo methods;data mining;information retrieval;pattern classification","MAP;Monte Carlo sampling;artificial defined opinion classifiers;evaluation framework;opinion mining;quality assessment;tropical opinion retrieval systems","","0","","10","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
