In our approach, we first investigate the link structure of the network in order to derive a legitimacy score for each node. Then we model these scores as a mixture of beta distributions. The number of components in the mixture is determined by the integrated classification likelihood Bayesian information criterion, while the parameters of each component are estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. This method allows us to automatically discriminate between spam senders and legitimate users. Experimental results show the suitability of the proposed approach and compare its performance to that of a previous fully-supervised method. We also illustrate our approach through a test application to Yahoo!

This leads to the presence of considerable contextual noise in such recordings that makes analysis difficult.

However, it is difficult for Japanese people to create nihonga, because it is necessary to prepare many kinds of expensive art supplies and to master complex classical techniques. Therefore, we developed a system that allows even people who do not have special skill of drawing to create nihonga portraits. Nihonga has contour, little shading, and simple expressions. Because we use these features of nihonga, the user can create a portrait only by combining some images as if they were making a collage, and system processing and interface are very simple. Furthermore, it also allows those who are expert painters to use paintings completed using the system as a reference before creating or repairing actual nihonga portraits.

Two-dimensional velocity can be measured by estimation of the Doppler center frequency and Doppler frequency rate for the range and azimuth velocity component, respectively. The Doppler spectrum along a Doppler phase history line in the time-frequency domain was reconstructed and projected onto the frequency and time dimension. The peak of the frequency-axis projected spectrum corresponds to the Doppler center frequency, while that of the time-axis indicates an azimuth time of closest approach. The Doppler frequency rate is also measured by the slope deviation of the Doppler spectrum. Simulation using TerraSAR-X parameters indicated that the velocity errors were less than 1 m/sec or 5% for moving objects with a velocity higher than 3 m/sec. While the measurement of Doppler center frequency was reliable over the entire velocity range, errors in Doppler frequency rate became large if the velocity was lower than 3 m/sec. An experiment using TerraSAR-X and truck-mounted corner reflectors validated the measurement accuracy of the approach. Absolute and percent errors of the range velocity were 1.4 km/h and 2.8%, respectively, while the azimuth velocity measurement was comparatively accurate under an assumption of zero acceleration. To apply the method to single-look complex data, the full Doppler bandwidth must be preserved. Application of a fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) to the same data is also presented. The FrFT approach significantly improves computational efficiency and is superior to the WVD approach in estimation of Doppler frequency rate.","","Electronic:978-89-93246-17-9; POD:978-1-4577-1351-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6087091","Doppler parameter;Joint time-frequency analysis;Moving object;TerraSAR-X","Azimuth;Doppler effect;History;Spaceborne radar;Time frequency analysis;Velocity measurement","Doppler radar;Fourier transforms;frequency measurement;information retrieval;radar resolution;synthetic aperture radar;time-frequency analysis;velocity measurement","Doppler bandwidth;Doppler center frequency measurement;Doppler frequency rate;TerraSAR-X parameter;WVD approach;azimuth velocity measurement;fractional Fourier transform;frequency-axis projected spectrum;joint time-frequency analysis;measurement accuracy;moving object velocity retrieval;single channel high resolution SAR data;single-look complex data;truck-mounted corner reflector","","0","","6","","","26-30 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The drawback of this approach is that it is not straightforward that a system with a slightly lower WER during tests will adapt properly to new utterances, and this is much more sensible when the baseline system has a big error rate since there are many features that could be improved. This tends to be the case of under-resourced languages, since the lack of resources has a great impact in the performance of the system and not all the standard methods are suitable to any kind of language or task.

But the current status of returned results is still far from satisfaction. Users have to be confronted with searching for a long result list to get the information really wanted. Many works focused on the post processing search results to facilitate users to examine the results. One of the common ways of post processing search result is clustering. Term-based clustering appears as first way to cluster the results. But this method is suffering from the poor quality while the processed pages have little text. Link-based clustering can conquer this problem. But the quality of clusters heavily depends on the number of in-links and out-links in common. In this paper, we propose that the short text attached to in-link is valuable information and it is helpful to reach high clustering quality. To distinguish them with general snippet, we name it as in-snippet. Based on the in-snippet, we propose a new clustering method that combines the links and the in-snippets together. In our method, similarity between pages consists of two parts : link similarity and term similarity. We designed related algorithm to implement clustering. In order to prevent bias from human judgments, the experiment datasets are collected from Open Directory Project(DMOZ). Due to DMOZ is human-edited directory, the datasets from DMOZ has higher quality and larger scale. We use entropy and f-measure to evaluate the quality of the final clusters. By being compared with the link-based and the pure term-based algorithms, our method outperforms others in clustering quality.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4555-4; POD:978-1-4577-1812-0","10.1109/WISA.2011.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6093575","Clustering;Link analysis;Search engine result","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Educational institutions;Entropy;Search engines;Vectors;Web pages","Internet;information retrieval;pattern clustering;search engines","DMOZ;Web search;entropy;f-measure;in-snippet;link similarity;link-based clustering;search engine;term similarity;term-based clustering","","2","","15","","","21-23 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Expanding identifiers to normalize source code vocabulary","D. Lawrie; D.

Effective tools exploit a variety of information and techniques to aid a software maintainer. One area of recent interest in tool development exploits the natural language information found in source code. Such Information Retrieval (IR) based tools compliment traditional static analysis tools and have tackled problems, such as feature location, that otherwise require considerable human effort. To reap the full benefit of IR-based techniques, the language used across all software artifacts (e.g., requirements, design, change requests, tests, and source code) must be consistent. Unfortunately, there is a significant proportion of invented vocabulary in source code. Vocabulary normalization aligns the vocabulary found in the source code with that found in other software artifacts. Most existing work related to normalization has focused on splitting an identifier into its constituent parts. The next step is to expand each part into a (dictionary) word that matches the vocabulary used in other software artifacts. Building on a successful approach to splitting identifiers, an implementation of an expansion algorithm is presented. Experiments on two systems find that up to 66% of identifiers are correctly expanded, which is within about 20% of the current system's best-case performance. Not only is this performance comparable to previous techniques, but the result is achieved in the absence of special purpose rules and not limited to restricted syntactic contexts. Results from these experiments also show the impact that varying levels of documentation (including both internal documentation such as the requirements and design, and external, or user-level, documentation) have on the algorithm's performance.","1063-6773;10636773","Electronic:978-1-4577-0664-6; POD:978-1-4577-0663-9","10.1109/ICSM.2011.6080778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6080778","natural language processing;program comprehension;source code analysis tools","Context;Dictionaries;Documentation;Natural languages;Software;Vocabulary","information retrieval;natural language processing;program diagnostics;software maintenance;source coding;vocabulary","IR-based techniques;feature location;identifier expansion;information retrieval based tools;natural language information;software artifacts;software maintenance;source code vocabulary normalization;splitting identifiers;static analysis tools","","16","","31","","","25-30 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, temporal expressions are often context-dependent, requiring the application of information about the context in order to work out their true values. We describe a representational formalism for temporal information that captures what we call the local semantics of such expressions; this permits a modularity whereby the context-independent contribution to meaning can be computed independently of the global context of interpretation, which may not be immediately or easily available.

Specifically, for C-IOS's two important tasks namely Experts Finding (EF) and Query Answering (QA) are required in collaboration. These two specific tasks facilitate supply-chain mediation and may be subsequent procurement negotiation. EF concerns about finding or match-making the right personnel in an organization as a committee member for fulfilling a part of the job. QA screens initially whether the resources and commitments are potentially available. The two tasks supposedly would have executed prior to any further collaboration, and the communication is cross organizations. This paper contributes a design of C-IOS that supports EF and QA for inter-organizational collaboration. The underlying technical framework is by Rule Responder which is a powerful tool for creating virtual organizations as multi-agent systems that support collaborative teams on the Semantic Web.

How can we find that data? It is tempting to cross the boundaries of development type, location, language, application and hardware to use existing datasets of other organizations. However, prior results caution that using such cross data may not be useful. Aim: We test two conjectures: (1) instance selection can automatically prune irrelevant instances and (2) retrieval from the remaining examples is useful for effort estimation, regardless of their source. Method: We selected 8 cross-within divisions (21 pairs of within-cross subsets) out of 19 datasets and evaluated these divisions under different analogy-based estimation (ABE) methods. Results: Between the within & cross experiments, there were few statistically significant differences in (i) the performance of effort estimators, or (ii) the amount of instances retrieved for estimation. Conclusion: For the purposes of effort estimation, there is little practical difference between cross and within data. After applying instance selection, the remaining examples (be they from within or from cross source divisions) can be used for effort estimation.","1949-3770;19493770","Electronic:978-0-7695-4604-9; POD:978-1-4577-2203-5","10.1109/ESEM.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6092574","cross resource;k-NN;software cost estimation;within resource","Artificial neural networks;Buildings;Data models;Estimation;Organizations;Training;Training data","data handling;estimation theory;information retrieval","ABE;analogy based estimation;cross source divisions;effort estimation;information retrieval;instance selection;relevant data","","12","","31","","","22-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, SIMD execution bottlenecks must be tackled in order to achieve high execution efficiency. We first analyze in this paper the implementation of two major kernel functions of H.264/AVC namely, SATD and subpel interpolation, in conventional SIMD architectures to identify the bottlenecks in traditional approaches. Based on the analysis results, we propose a new SIMD architecture with two novel features: 1) parallel memory structure with variable block size and word length support, and 2) configurable SIMD structure. The proposed parallel memory structure allows great flexibility for programmers to perform data access of different block sizes and different word lengths. The configurable SIMD structure allows almost ‚Äúrandom‚Äù register file access and slightly different operations in ALUs inside SIMD. The new features greatly benefit the realization of H.264/AVC kernel functions. For instance, the fractional motion estimation, particularly the half to quarter pixel interpolation, can now be executed with minimal or no additional memory access. When comparing with the conventional SIMD systems, the proposed SIMD architecture can have a further speedup of 2.1X to 4.6X when implementing H.264/AVC kernel functions. Based on Amdahl's law, the overall speedup of H.264/AVC encoding application can be projected to be 2.46X. We expect significant improvement can also be achieved when applying the proposed architecture to other image and video processing applications.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2130250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734815","Configurable SIMD;SIMD bottlenecks;parallel memory structure;video codec processor","Memory architecture;Parallel processing;Video codecs;Video signal processing","information retrieval;memory architecture;parallel architectures;reconfigurable architectures;video codecs","ALU;Amdahl law;H.264-AVC encoding application;H.264-AVC kernel function;SATD;configurable SIMD structure;data access;data level parallelism;fractional motion estimation;high execution efficiency;high performance video processor;image application;improved SIMD architecture;parallel memory structure;quarter pixel interpolation;random register file access;single instruction multiple data execution;subpel interpolation;video application;word length support","","8","","28","","20110317","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the proposal, each node keeps two pieces of information, one is the hop-limited routing tables, storing the route information to nodes within a small number (say n) hops from each node. The hop-limited routing table is substantially equivalent to the hop-limited shortest path tree, which is made of nodes within limited hop distance from the root. The other is the file list, which is an index over files kept by nodes within n hops from each node. To find a file, a node first checks its file list. If the requested file is found in the list, the node sends a file request message to the file owner, otherwise, it sends a file-search message to a randomly-selected leaf node on the hop-limited shortest path tree rooted at itself. Numerical examples show that our proposal has much smaller search latency and lower file-search failure ratio than the primitive random-walk-based search, while it wastes much less network bandwidth than network-broadcast-based searches.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9640-2; POD:978-1-4577-1448-1","10.1109/3PGCIC.2011.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6103137","P2P;file search;random walk;unstructured","Barium;Indexes;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Routing;Unicast;Vectors","information retrieval;message passing;peer-to-peer computing;random processes;storage management;tree data structures","concatenated hop-limited trees;file list;file request message;file-search failure ratio;file-search message;hop-limited routing tables;hop-limited shortest path tree;random walk-based file search;randomly-selected leaf node;route information storage;search latency;unstructured P2P networks","","0","","22","","","26-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ensuring efficient access to such datasets is hindered by the high latencies of wide-area networks. To speed up access, files can be replicated so a user can access a nearby replica. Much of the work on the replica placement problem in data grids has focused on average system performance and ignored quality assurance issues. In the existing work that considers QoS, a simplified replication model is often assumed, therefore, resulting solutions may not be applicable to real systems. In this paper, we introduce a more realistic model for replica placement in hierarchical Data Grids which determines the positions of a minimum number of replicas expected to satisfy certain quality requirements both from user and system perspectives. Our placement algorithm is based on a highly distributed and decentralized technique that exploits the data access history for popular data files and computes replica locations by minimizing overall replication cost (read and update) while maximizing QoS satisfaction for a given traffic pattern. The problem is formulated using dynamic programming. We assess our algorithm using OptorSim. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our replica placement technique considering various factors such as storage and workload constraints of replica servers, link capacity constraints, user QoS requirements, etc.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9640-2; POD:978-1-4577-1448-1","10.1109/3PGCIC.2011.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6103156","data grids;distributed algorithm;dynamic programming;quality of service;replication;workload and link constraints","Bandwidth;Cost function;Equations;Heuristic algorithms;Mathematical model;Quality of service;Servers","data analysis;distributed algorithms;dynamic programming;grid computing;information retrieval;quality assurance;quality of service;replicated databases;storage management","OptorSim;QoS satisfaction;average system performance;data access history;decentralized technique;distributed data-intensive applications;distributed placement;distributed technique;dynamic programming;hierarchical data grids;link capacity constraints;nearby replica;overall replication cost;placement algorithm;popular data files;quality assurance issues;quality requirements;realistic model;replica locations;replica placement problem;replica placement technique;replica servers;replicas;replication model;system QoS constraints;system perspective;traffic pattern;user QoS constraints;user QoS requirements;user perspective;wide-area networks","","3","","17","","","26-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wu","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, USA","2011 IEEE Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization","20111201","2011","","","65","72","As computing power increases exponentially, vast amount of data is created by many scientific research activities. However, the bandwidth for storing the data to disks and reading the data from disks has been improving at a much slower pace. These two trends produce an ever-widening data access gap. Our work brings together two distinct technologies to address this data access issue: indexing and in situ processing. From decades of database research literature, we know that indexing is an effective way to address the data access issue, particularly for accessing relatively small fraction of data records. As data sets increase in sizes, more and more analysts need to use selective data access, which makes indexing an even more important for improving data access. The challenge is that most implementations of indexing technology are embedded in large database management systems (DBMS), but most scientific datasets are not managed by any DBMS. In this work, we choose to include indexes with the scientific data instead of requiring the data to be loaded into a DBMS.We use compressed bitmap indexes from the FastBit software which are known to be highly effective for query-intensive workloads common to scientific data analysis. To use the indexes, we need to build them first. The index building procedure needs to access the whole data set and may also require a significant amount of compute time. In this work, we adapt the in situ processing technology to generate the indexes, thus removing the need of reading data from disks and to build indexes in parallel. The in situ data processing system used is ADIOS, a middleware for high-performance I/O. Our experimental results show that the indexes can improve the data access time up to 200 times depending on the fraction of data selected, and using in situ data processing system can effectively reduce the time needed to create the indexes, up to 10 times with our in situ technique when using identical parallel settings.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0155-8; POD:978-1-4673-0156-5","10.1109/LDAV.2011.6092319","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6092319","","Buildings;Computational modeling;Data models;Data processing;Indexing;Parallel processing","data analysis;database indexing;database management systems;disc storage;information retrieval;middleware;records management;storage management","DBMS;FastBit software;compressed bitmap indexes;data access;data analysis;data intensive computing;data records;data storage management;database management systems;database research literature;disk storage;middleware;parallel in situ indexing","","8","","22","","","23-24 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the increasing discrepancy between the speed of computation and that of I/O on multi-core machines, the cost of I/O becomes a major bottleneck for out-of-core computation. Among techniques that reduce runtime I/O cost, reordering file layout to increase data locality has become popular in recent years. Better layout optimization relies on the knowledge of the data access pattern, which can be acquired from benchmarking. For streamline computation, we observe that the data access pattern is highly dependent on the flow directions. As a disk I/O request can generally be done more efficiently with shorter seek distances, we propose a novel flow-guided file layout method to improve the I/O performance. With a weighted directed graph to model the data access pattern, the file layout problem can be formulated as a linear graph arrangement problem. The goal is to minimized the sum of the disk seek time based on the linear distances between all pairs of adjacent graph nodes. We use a divide-and-conquer algorithm to approximate the optimal layout. The experimental results show that our flow-guided layout outperforms layouts that use space filling curves and some of the more recent cache-oblivious mesh layout methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0155-8; POD:978-1-4673-0156-5","10.1109/LDAV.2011.6092326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6092326","","Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Data models;Data visualization;Layout;Runtime;Vectors","benchmark testing;data flow computing;divide and conquer methods;file organisation;graphs;information retrieval;multiprocessing systems;optimisation","cache-oblivious mesh layout method;data access pattern;data locality;disk I-O request;divide-and-conquer algorithm;file reordering method;flow direction;flow-guided file layout;layout optimization;linear graph arrangement problem;multicore machine;optimal layout;out-of-core streamline computation;runtime I-O efficiency;space filling curve;streamline computation","","1","","4","","","23-24 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to strict realtime and short wireless transmission range coverage constraints, a heavily overloaded RSU may experience high deadline miss rate in effect of serving too many requests beyond its capacity. In this work, we investigate the vehicle submitted requests are generally two types: delay sensitive and delay tolerant.

Recognition for item information (single words) and associative information (word pairs) was tested using Tulving's (1985) remember/know response procedure.

The provided data set includes a set of photos and the associated information from GPS and orientation sensor. This attached metadata is noisy and lacks precision. Our strategy to correct this uncertain data is based on the data fusion between measurement model, derived from sensor data, and signal model given by the computer vision algorithms. Based on the retrieved information from multiple views of a scene we make a grid of images. Our robust feature detection and matching between images result in finding a reliable transformation. Consequently, relative location and orientation of the data set construct the signal model. On the other hand, information extracted from the single images combined with the measurement data make the measurement model. Finally, Kalman filter is used to fuse these two models iteratively and enhance the estimation of the ground truth(GT) location and orientation. Practically, this approach can help us to design a photo browsing system from a huge collection of photos, enabling 3D navigation and exploration of our huge data set.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1010-0; POD:978-1-4577-1009-4; USB:978-1-4577-1008-7","10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6096689","","Cameras;Computational modeling;Data models;Estimation;Noise;Noise measurement;Uncertainty","Kalman filters;computer vision;feature extraction;image fusion;image matching;image retrieval;information retrieval;iterative methods;meta data","3D geometadata;3D navigation;GPS;GT orientation;Kalman filter;computer vision algorithms;data fusion;data set;ground truth location;image grid;image matching;information extraction;information retrieval;iterative fusion;measurement model;orientation sensor;photo browsing system;photo capture device;photo collections;photo grid;robust correction;robust estimation;robust feature detection;sensor data;signal model","","0","","21","","","9-11 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an approach (Coparvo) complementary to existing trace ability recovery approaches for object-oriented programs. Coparvo reduces false positive links recovered by traditional trace ability recovery processes thus reducing the manual validation effort. Coparvo assumes that information extracted from different entities (i.e., class names, comments, class variables, or methods signatures) are different information sources, they may have different level of reliability in requirements trace ability and each information source may act as a different expert recommending trace ability links. We applied Coparvo on three data sets, Pooka, SIP Communicator, and iTrust, to filter out false positive links recovered via the information retrieval approach, i.e., vector space model. The results show that Coparvo significantly improves the of the recovered links accuracy and also reduces up to 83% effort required to manually remove false positive links.","1095-1350;10951350","Electronic:978-0-7695-4582-0; POD:978-1-4577-1948-6","10.1109/WCRE.2011.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6079774","Object-Oriented;Traceability;experts;requirements;source code;source code partitions","Accuracy;Electronic mail;Java;Manganese;Object oriented modeling;Software;Vectors","information retrieval;object-oriented methods;program diagnostics;systems analysis","Coparvo;information retrieval approach;object oriented systems;requirements traceability;software evolution;source code partitioning;source code portfolio;trace ability recovery approaches","","9","","25","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, little work has been done on better understanding how developers perform feature location tasks. In this paper, we report an exploratory study of feature location process, consisting of two experiments in which developers were given unfamiliar systems and asked to complete six feature location tasks in two hours. Our study suggests that feature location process can be understood hierarchically at three levels of granularities: phase, pattern, and action. Furthermore, our study suggests that these feature-location phases, patterns and actions can be effectively imparted to junior developers and consequently improve their performance on feature location tasks.

The proposed technique utilizes low-level shape features and the keywords are assigned using a graphed-based label transfer mechanism to expand the training dataset. A weighted metric learning method is used to learn the distance measure from the extended dataset. Then multiple semantic annotation task can be completed on the learned distance measure.

All the information about these learning objects (LOs) is described in any metadata labeling standard (LOM, Dublin Core, etc). It is necessary to work and develop solutions that provide efficiency in searching for heterogeneous content and finding distributed context. Distributed information retrieval, or federated search, attempts to respond to the problem of information retrieval in the hidden Web. The main aim of a federated search is to develop models and strategies to get the most benefit from these distributed sources. Thus, users perceive the system as a single point of access to information they require, regardless of the number of sources that exist, its location, or its management mechanism. The process is completely transparent to the user, who does not perceive its complexity and therefore treats any of the information retrieved uniformly. This paper describes an architecture that recovers educational content, called AIREH (Architecture for Intelligent Recovery of Educational content in Heterogeneous Environments), which combines the dynamism and flexibility of multi-agent organizations. The proposal uses systems and mechanisms by which agents acquire roles based on the generation and use of dynamic web services.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1127-5; POD:978-1-4577-1125-1","10.1109/NWeSP.2011.6088166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088166","Federated Search;Learning Object;Repositories","Adaptation models;Atmospheric modeling;Context;Metasearch;Organizations;Standards organizations;Web services","Web services;computer aided instruction;information retrieval;meta data;multi-agent systems","AIREH educational content;architecture for intelligent recovery of educational content in heterogeneous environments;distributed information retrieval;educational content retrieval;federated search;hidden Web;learning object repositories;metadata labeling standard;multi-agent organization;semantic Web service","","0","","12","","","19-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach proposed focuses on primary text sequences labeling first and also gives consideration to repetitive patterns of them as well. We propose a Two-Level extraction model for entity recognition and repetitive pattern extraction algorithm for entity integration. Our approach can effectively reduce the attribute labeling mistakes.

The data harnessed in MIMIC-II were collected from the ICUs of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2001 to 2008 and represent 26,870 adult hospital admissions (version 2.6). MIMIC-II consists of two major components: clinical data and physiological waveforms. The clinical data, which include patient demographics, intravenous medication drip rates, and laboratory test results, were organized into a relational database. The physiological waveforms, including 125 Hz signals recorded at bedside and corresponding vital signs, were stored in an open-source format. MIMIC-II data were also deidentified in order to remove protected health information. Any interested researcher can gain access to MIMIC-II free of charge after signing a data use agreement and completing human subjects training. MIMIC-II can support a wide variety of research studies, ranging from the development of clinical decision support algorithms to retrospective clinical studies.

While nowadays broadcasting channels are keen to monitor online events, identifying topics of interest from huge volume of user uploaded videos and giving recommendation to emerging topics are by no means easy. Specifically, such process involves discovering of new topic, visualization of the topic content, and incremental monitoring of topic evolution. This paper studies the problem from three aspects. First, given a large set of videos collected over months, an efficient algorithm based on salient trajectory extraction on a topic evolution link graph is proposed for topic discovery. Second, topic trajectory is visualized as a temporal graph in 2-D space, with one dimension as time and another as degree of hotness, for depicting the birth, growth, and decay of a topic. Finally, giving the previously discovered topics, an incremental monitoring algorithm is proposed to track newly uploaded videos, while discovering new topics and giving recommendation to potentially hot topics. We demonstrate the application on three months' videos crawled from YouTube during December 2008 to February 2009.

An important class of these systems is body sensor networks (BSNs) where lightweight embedded processors and communication systems are tightly coupled with the human body. BSNs can provide researchers, care providers and clinicians access to tremendously valuable information extracted from data that are collected in users' natural environment. With this information, one can monitor the progression of a disease, identify its early onset, or simply assess user's wellness. One major obstacle is managing repositories that store the large amount of sensing data. To address this issue, we propose a data mining approach inspired by the experience in the areas of text and natural language processing. We represent sensor readings with a sequence of characters, called motion transcripts. Transcripts reduce complexity of the data significantly while maintaining morphological and structural properties of the physiological signals. To further take advantage of the physiological signal's structure, our data mining technique focuses on the characteristic transitions in the signals. These transitions are efficiently captured using the concept of <i>n</i>-grams. To facilitate a lightweight and fast mining approach, we reduce the overwhelmingly large number of <i>n</i>-grams via information gain (IG) feature selection. We report the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of the speed of mining while maintaining an acceptable accuracy in terms of the F-score combining both precision and recall.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2011.2161238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995280","<formula formulatype=""inline""><tex Notation=""TeX"">$n$</tex></formula>-grams;Body sensor networks (BSNs);Patricia tree;data mining;string templates","Biomedical monitoring;Body sensor networks;Cyberspace;Data mining;Data models;Network topology","body sensor networks;data mining;diseases;information retrieval;medical signal processing;natural language processing;patient monitoring;physiological models;text analysis","body sensor network;cyber physical systems;data mining;data repository;disease;feature selection;information extraction;information gain;motion transcripts;n-grams;natural language processing;patient monitoring;physiological signals;text analysis","","3","","48","","20110822","Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present a framework for information extraction that allow to wrap information from different web sources and to generate linked data. Furthermore, we survey a number of approaches in the bibliography to build Enterprise Service Buses in the context of semantic-web technologies, which comprise RDF, RDFS, OWL, and SPARQL languages.

In order to overcome these shortcomings, in this paper, a new fingerprint recognition scheme based on a set of assembled invariant moment (geometric moment and Zernike moment) features to ensure the secure communications is proposed. And the proposed scheme is also based on an effective preprocessing, the extraction of local and global features and a powerful classification tool, thus it is able to handle the various input conditions encountered in the cloud computing communication.

"US IOOS<sup>¬Æ</sup> - from integrated to Interdependent and Indispensible","Z. Willis","US IOOS Program Office, NOAA, Sliver Spring, USA","OCEANS'11 MTS/IEEE KONA","20111219","2011","","","1","4","Integration is defined providing rapid access to multidisciplinary data from many sources and to provide data and information required to achieve multiple goals that historically have been the domain of separate agencies, offices, or programs. There are plenty of examples and efforts underway within US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS<sup>¬Æ</sup>) that are moving us to a fully integrated system. The President's Executive Order 13547, outlines our policy to achieve ‚Äúan America whose stewardship ensures that the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes are healthy and resilient, safe and productive, and understood and treasured so as to promote the wellbeing, prosperity, and security of present and future generations.‚Äù For US IOOS to be a vital contributor to this goal we suggest a need to move beyond Integration to become ‚ÄúInterdependent‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndispensible.‚Äù Given the current fiscal climate, no one agency, entity or program can act alone. The scientific information needed to guide personal and programmatic decisions necessitates taking the next step to interdependence. Are we ready to take that step? Interdependences also refer to the fact that the subsystems can not stand alone. To deliver necessary capabilities IOOS elements must progress from the research and development stages, through efficient test and operational efforts into routine operations. Technologies must be incubated and rapidly inserted to keep the US IOOS system operating effectively and efficiently. Prompt delivery of meaningful output to the end user demands a fully interdependent system. One in which the models and observations are standardized and work seamlessly together to rapidly tailor the output to users' needs. But interdependence also suggests that each partner be it at the Federal, State, Local and Tribal level or the Private sector needs to be the- e for the long term. The analogy is really the three legged stool. Once you become interdependent, if one of the partners pulls back the stool falls when ability for the other partners/legs are unable to support the enterprise. This demands not only policy and technology, but trust. Once partners and programs are fully interdependent they become indispensible. This paper will provide examples within IOOS that suggests the move is underway. The paper will provide an update on the US IOOS Blueprint to Full Capability, will provide examples of observation networks that rely on multiple partnerships to remain viable, and how the information, products and services are now have been fully endorsed by managers and decision makers.","0197-7385;01977385","Electronic:978-0-933957-39-8; Paper:978-1-4577-1427-6","10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6106947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6106947","Integrated Ocean Observing System;Integration;Interdependent;Ocean Observing","Communities;Radar;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Tsunami;US Government agencies","data integration;geophysics computing;information networks;information retrieval;oceanographic techniques","IOOS elements;US IOOS;US Integrated Ocean Observing System;data integration;fully interdependent system;multidisciplinary data;observation networks;rapid data access;scientific information","","0","","","","","19-22 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Web Service search approach based on semantic and search engine","Gao Shu; XiongWei Xu; Huang Hua","School of Computer Science, Wuhan University of Technology, 430063 China","2011 6th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Applications","20111219","2011","","","484","489","Traditional method of Web Service search is based on the UDDI registry. UDDI is very popular in the domain of Web Service publishing, but it's not very suitable for Web Service discovering as it is based on keyword match. In this paper we propose a model to discover Web service based on semantic and search engine, and design its architecture. At the same time, we put forward the algorithm of splitting words and the algorithm of query expansion, develop a Web Service search prototype, give a case study, and discuss the recall, the precision and the efficiency of the prototype.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0208-2; POD:978-1-4577-0209-9","10.1109/ICPCA.2011.6106551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6106551","Web Service search;expansion query;search engine;semantic","Education;HTML;Internet;Microstrip","Web services;information retrieval;search engines","UDDI registry;Web service discovery;Web service publishing;Web service search approach;keyword match;search engine;semantic engine","","0","","10","","","26-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Needs are often met by purchasing separate product suites or packages, which can be incompatible, and contain unused overlapping functionality. In this paper we discuss our experience of applying a more holistic approach. We look at how purchased software can be extended in-house with the help of a program transformation technique, and can then be utilised in a service-oriented architecture for the purposes of information retrieval, data and process integration. By reusing software components for reporting and integration purposes, we have been able to realise savings in all phases of the software lifecycle.","1095-1350;10951350","Electronic:978-0-7695-4582-0; POD:978-1-4577-1948-6","10.1109/WCRE.2011.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6079868","Program transformation;SQR;enterprise application integration;production reporting;service architecture","Generators;Investments;Java;Layout;Software;XML","information retrieval;manufacturing data processing;object-oriented programming;program compilers;service-oriented architecture;software reliability;software reusability","corporate IT;data integration;enterprise application integration;information retrieval;machine-assisted program transformation;process integration;product packages;production integration;production reporting;program transformation technique;purchased software;separate product suites;service-oriented architecture;software components reuse;software lifecycle;unused overlapping functionality","","0","","10","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As each type of question is designed of certain matching rules, if a question and a rule matches, this question belongs to the corresponding answer category. Therefore, the use of this strategy can reduce the search space and improve the efficiency of information retrieval. In particular, using this method in the Tibetan question-answering system can effectively improve people to obtain more accurate information.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4543-1; POD:978-1-4577-1626-3","10.1109/ICINIS.2011.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104730","Tibetan;question classification;question-answering system","Grammar;Information processing;Natural language processing;Search engines;Semantics","natural language processing;pattern classification;question answering (information retrieval)","Tibetan online automatic question-answering system;information retrieval;matching rule;question classification method","","0","","8","","","1-3 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
