We record four observers' eye movements when they are viewing 100 FRGC [1] frontal view face images and find that the observers are highly consistent in the regions fixated. Inspired by the fact that fovea of HVS has a much higher spatial acuity than the periphery, a face recognition algorithm based on spatial variant sampling is proposed to simulate such foveated imaging phenomenon, where more information is reserved for the fixated regions. Moreover, information extracted from glance which adopts the low spatial frequency components of the image is integrated into the face recognition system to elicit a percept that occurs before any fixations. The experimental results on FERET database [2] demonstrate that the proposed method not only reduces the computational cost, but also achieves comparable performance, which shows that the characteristics of the HVS provide valuable insights into face recognition.","","DVD:978-1-4244-9139-1; Electronic:978-1-4244-9141-4; POD:978-1-4244-9140-7","10.1109/FG.2011.5771340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5771340","Face Recognition;Human Visual System","Databases;Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Humans;Observers;Pixel","face recognition;image retrieval;information retrieval","FERET database;attention driven face recognition algorithm;foveated imaging phenomenon;human visual system;information extraction;selective attention;spatial variant fixations","","1","1","20","","","21-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Magnetic Tunneling Junction (MTJ) is the basic building block of the MRAM which is used to store information extracting the two-valued resistance property. With the discovery of Giant Magneto Resistance effect (GMR) and Tunnel Magneto Resistance effect (TMR) phenomenon in the magnetic multilayer of MTJ, the difference between the two resistances is distinct. Writing in MTJ can be carried with superior speed, low power using Spin Transfer Torque (STT) writing technique. The parallel and anti-parallel configurations of the MTJ can be carried out by manipulating the spin of the electrons of the magnetic multilayer. In this paper, we have modelled the Fe-MgO-Fe MTJ in atomic level using the software Atomistix ToolKit (ATK) Virtual NanoLab (VNL) 2008.10. We have analysed the V-I characteristics of the MTJ for the various bias voltages and have obtained the resistance of 5.2 MΩ and 55.7 MΩ for the parallel and anti-parallel configurations respectively. This difference in the two resistances holds good to differentiate the data `0' or `1' stored in the MTJ. The TMR thus calculated is around 950%. Higher the TMR ratio lower is the Resistance Area (RA) product.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8679-3; POD:978-1-4244-8678-6","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5941929","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941929","Giant Magneto Resistance effect (GMR);Magnetic RAM (MRAM);Magnetic Tunneling Junction (MTJ);Spin Transfer Torque (STT);Tunnel Magneto Resistance effect (TMR)","Electrodes;Junctions;Magnetic multilayers;Magnetic tunneling;Resistance;Tunneling magnetoresistance","MRAM devices;giant magnetoresistance;information retrieval;magnetic multilayers;tunnelling magnetoresistance;virtual instrumentation","Atomistix ToolKit software;Virtual NanoLab 2008.10;atomic level;giant magneto resistance effect;information extraction;magnetic RAM;magnetic multilayer;magnetic tunneling junction;nonvolatile memory device;resistance area product;spin transfer torque writing technique;tunnel magneto resistance effect;two-valued resistance property","","0","","14","","","8-10 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Agility (contemporary) versus rigidity (traditional) are approaches that have their trade-offs but to meet the demands and needs of our war-fighters, we must have an ESE process that allows us to deliver quality capabilities to the tactical edge. Governance plays a significant role and testing services needs to be addressed different from the traditional T&E of stovepiped systems. The traditional approach of building systems to deliver a specific function is being changed to an approach of architecting services. ESE utilizes defined processes that use managerial and technical tools to analyze problems and provide structure to the overall process of planning, procuring, designing, implementing and testing an enterprise system. Adding agility and assurance to the traditional and ESE is the process by which we build quality into complex systems while delivering functionality and security of contents in a manageable timeframe and stay flexible to meet emerging requirements. This study is based on architecting the GIG which is the ultimate complex system. Utilizing the DoD's framework to facilitate information sharing; which starts with data discovery and access, we analyzed several concepts to achieve agility and higher level of security in Information Sharing Systems. The concept of the GIG also ensures that systems are not only robust but also incorporate the flexibility needed to satisfy needs that evolve during the system's life.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9493-4; POD:978-1-4244-9494-1","10.1109/SYSCON.2011.5929083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929083","","Distributed databases;Security;Service oriented architecture;Standards;US Department of Defense","grid computing;information retrieval;military computing;safety-critical software;software prototyping;systems engineering","DoD framework;ESE process;GIG;agile development;architecting services;building systems;complex systems;cyber security integration;data access;data discovery;enterprise systems engineering process;governance;information repositories architecture;information sharing systems;manageable timeframe;net centric environment;stovepiped systems;technological advances;testing services;time constrained mission-centric environment;ultimate complex system","","3","","15","","","4-7 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"CubeLSI: An effective and efficient method for searching resources in social tagging systems","B. Bi; S. D. Lee; B. Kao; R. Cheng","The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","2011 IEEE 27th International Conference on Data Engineering","20110516","2011","","","27","38","In a social tagging system, resources (such as photos, video and web pages) are associated with tags. These tags allow the resources to be effectively searched through tag-based keyword matching using traditional IR techniques. We note that in many such systems, tags of a resource are often assigned by a diverse audience of causal users (taggers). This leads to two issues that gravely affect the effectiveness of resource retrieval: (1) Noise: tags are picked from an uncontrolled vocabulary and are assigned by untrained taggers. The tags are thus noisy features in resource retrieval. (2) A multitude of aspects: different taggers focus on different aspects of a resource. Representing a resource using a flattened bag of tags ignores this important diversity of taggers. To improve the effectiveness of resource retrieval in social tagging systems, we propose CubeLSI - a technique that extends traditional LSI to include taggers as another dimension of feature space of resources. We compare CubeLSI against a number of other tag-based retrieval models and show that CubeLSI significantly outperforms the other models in terms of retrieval accuracy. We also prove two interesting theorems that allow CubeLSI to be very efficiently computed despite the much enlarged feature space it employs.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4244-8960-2; POD:978-1-4244-8959-6; USB:978-1-4244-8958-9","10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5767863","","Large scale integration;Matrix decomposition;Portable computers;Semantics;Tagging;Tensile stress;Vocabulary","identification technology;information retrieval;social networking (online);string matching;vocabulary","CubeLSI;IR technique;resource retrieval;social tagging system;tag based keyword matching;tag based retrieval model;uncontrolled vocabulary","","3","","32","","","11-16 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classical data integration systems rely on a mediated schema created by human experts through an intensive design process. Automatic generation of mediated schemas is still a goal to be achieved. We generate mediated schemas by merging multiple source schemas interrelated by tuple-generating dependencies (tgds). Schema merging is the process to consolidate multiple schemas into a unified view. The task becomes particularly challenging when the schemas are highly heterogeneous and autonomous. Existing approaches fall short in various aspects, such as restricted expressiveness of input mappings, lacking data level interpretation, the output mapping is not in a logical language (or not given at all), and being confined to binary merging. We present here a novel system which is able to perform native n-ary schema merging using P2P style tgds as input. Suited in the scenario of generating mediated schemas for data integration, the system opts for a minimal schema signature retaining all certain answers of conjunctive queries. Logical output mappings are generated to support the mediated schemas, which enable query answering and, in some cases, query rewriting.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4244-8960-2; POD:978-1-4244-8959-6; USB:978-1-4244-8958-9","10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5767913","","Cognition;Engines;Joints;Merging;Query processing;Semantics","data handling;peer-to-peer computing;query processing;question answering (information retrieval)","P2P style;conjunctive queries;data dependencies;data integration architecture;input mapping restricted expressiveness;lacking data level interpretation;logical output mappings;mediated schema automatic generation;multiple source schema merging;n-ary schema merging;query answering;query rewriting;tuple-generating dependencies","","2","","15","","","11-16 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Answering such queries is important in many applications such as data cleaning and record linkage, where errors could occur in queries as well as the data. Many existing algorithms have focused on in-memory indexes. In this paper we investigate how to efficiently answer such queries in a disk-based setting, by systematically studying the effects of storing data and indexes on disk. We devise a novel physical layout for an inverted index to answer queries and we study how to construct it with limited buffer space. To answer queries, we develop a cost-based, adaptive algorithm that balances the I/O costs of retrieving candidate matches and accessing inverted lists. Experiments on large, real datasets verify that simply adapting existing algorithms to a disk-based setting does not work well and that our new techniques answer queries efficiently.

The approach presented in this paper attempts to identify such information using the queries posed in the past as they can serve as useful indicators of the queries likely to be posed in future. The approach uses queries posed in the past to create subject specific domains in a data warehouse. This is followed by identifying the frequent queries from amongst them.

Our goal is to optimize in-network caching in order to reduce the number of retrieval attempts for each content request. Therefore, we design two distributed caching techniques: in last router caching, a router caches a file only when it detects that the end user has disconnected; in price based caching, users tag their files with a maximum acceptable caching price while routers individually establish caching price to ensure that the average cache holding time is longer than the duration of user disconnection. In both approaches, the least recently used (LRU) cache replacement policy is employed and a reconnecting mobile user seeks the closest cached file copy. Using simple analytic models to set caching prices, we compare these techniques against baseline methods that either perform no caching, or cache files at every intermediate router, or make random caching decisions at each router. Simulation results suggest that our proposed methods reduce the number of retrieval attempts of highly mobile users, without penalizing stationary users.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-680-4; POD:978-1-61284-681-1","10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876480","","Electronic mail;Internet;Mobile communication;Nickel;Pricing;Routing protocols;Servers","decision making;file organisation;information retrieval;mobile computing;telecommunication network routing","LRU cache replacement policy;cached file copy;content request retrieval;distributed caching technique;en-route personal content caching;in-network caching optimization;intermediate router;intermittently connected mobile user;least recently used cache replacement policy;price based caching;random caching decision making;user tag","","0","","22","","","3-4 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to compute the web ranking, the web-link graph structure is to be processed to analyze the importance of the linkage. The time and space complexity for web ranking can be enormous as the number of web grows rapidly. Peer-to-peer (P2P) network computational models are an important approach to process such task efficiently. However, as mentioned that number of webs is increased continuously, a web ranking algorithm that considers the web-link graph as a static set of data may not be appropriated. When a snapshot of the web-link graph is being processed, the new change can occur. Thus, the ranking result can be inaccurate. In this paper, we proposed an efficient approach to incrementally compute web rankings on a P2P network. The proposed approach processes almost only the changed part of the web-link graph in the distributed manner, thus it performs the web ranking efficiently. Our experiment results show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the computational cost as well as the communication cost.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-840-2; POD:978-1-61284-839-6","10.1109/ICCRD.2011.5763901","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763901","","Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Measurement;Merging;Partitioning algorithms;Peer to peer computing;Web search","Web services;computational complexity;information retrieval;peer-to-peer computing","P2P networks;Web search services;Web-link graph structure;incremental Web ranking;space complexity;time complexity","","1","","13","","","11-13 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, we define graph pattern matching based on a revised notion of graph simulation. On graphs in emerging applications such as social networks, we show that these queries are capable of finding more sensible information than their traditional counterparts. Better still, their increased expressive power does not come with extra complexity. Indeed, (1) we investigate their containment and minimization problems, and show that these fundamental problems are in quadratic time for reachability queries and are in cubic time for pattern queries. (2) We develop an algorithm for answering reachability queries, in quadratic time as for their traditional counterpart.

In this paper we focus on the important part of transforming unstructured information from Web pages into structured relations. Relation extraction systems capture information from natural language text on Web pages, called Web text. However, extraction is quite costly and time consuming. Worse, many Web pages may not contain a textual representation of a relation that the extractor can capture. As a result many irrelevant pages are processed by relation extractors. We propose a relation predictor to filter out irrelevant pages and substantially speed up the overall information extraction process. As a classifier, we trained a support vector machine (SVM). We evaluate pages on a sentence level, where each sentence is transformed into a token representation of shallow text features. We evaluate our relation predictor on 18 different relation extractors. Extractors vary in their number of attributes and their extraction domain. Our evaluation corpus contains more than six million sentences from several hundred thousand pages. We report a prediction time of tens of milliseconds per page and observe high recall across domains. Our experimental study shows that the relation predictor effectively forwards only relevant pages to the relation extractor. We report a speedup of at least factor two while discarding only a minimal amount of relations. If only fixed amount e.g. 10% of the pages in the corpus are processed, the predictor drastically increases the recall by a factor of five on average.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9196-4; POD:978-1-4244-9195-7; USB:978-1-4244-9194-0","10.1109/ICDEW.2011.5767644","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5767644","","Data mining;Encoding;Feature extraction;Pipelines;Semantics;Training;Web pages","Internet;data mining;information retrieval;pattern classification;support vector machines","Web pages;Web text;classification algorithms;information extraction process;knowledge discovery;natural language text;relation extraction systems;relation prediction;support vector machine;unstructured information transformation","","0","","21","","","11-16 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the explosive growth of digital music available on the Web, automatic audio tagging, which can be used to annotate unknown music or retrieve desirable music, is becoming increasingly important. This can be achieved by training a binary classifier for each tag based on the labeled music data. Our method that won the MIREX 2009 audio tagging competition is one of this kind of methods. However, since social tags are usually assigned by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation information is useful for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem and propose two solutions to solve it.

This research, address the confidentiality issue by designing and developing new model for data confidentiality. It provides a view of data sensitivity and suggests areas in cryptography to protect data at different sensitivity levels. The proposed model protects transmitting data using role-base security policy and cryptographic system. We classified related information into several sensitivity levels.

"Minimizing retrieval latency for content cloud","M. Björkqvist; L. Y. Chen; M. Vukolić; Xi Zhang","IBM Research Zurich Laboratory, Switzerland","2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","20110630","2011","","","1080","1088","Content cloud systems, e.g. CloudFront and CloudBurst, in which content items are retrieved by end-users from the edge nodes of the cloud, are becoming increasingly popular. The retrieval latency in content clouds depends on content availability in the edge nodes, which in turn depends on the caching policy at the edge nodes. In case of local content unavailability (i.e., a cache miss), edge nodes resort to source selection strategies to retrieve the content items either vertically from the central server, or horizontally from other edge nodes. Consequently, managing the latency in content clouds needs to take into account several interrelated issues: asymmetric bandwidth and caching capacity for both source types as well as edge node heterogeneity in terms of caching policies and source selection strategies applied. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the retrieval latency considering both caching and retrieval capacity of the edge nodes and server simultaneously. We derive analytical models to evaluate the content retrieval latency under two source selection strategies, i.e., Random and Shortest-Queue, and three caching policies: selfish, collective, and a novel caching policy that we call the adaptive caching policy. Our analysis allows the quantification of the interrelated performance impacts of caching and retrieval capacity and the exploration of the corresponding design space. In particular, we show that the adaptive caching policy combined with Shortest-Queue selection scales well with various network configurations and adapts to the load changes in our simulation and analytical results.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4244-9921-2; POD:978-1-4244-9919-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934883","","Adaptive systems;Bandwidth;Collaboration;Gold;Peer to peer computing;Servers;Silver","cloud computing;information retrieval","CloudBurst;CloudFront;adaptive caching policy;collective caching policy;content cloud systems;edge node caching capacity;edge node retrieval capacity;random source selection strategy;retrieval latency minimization;selfish caching policy;shortest-queue source selection strategy;source selection strategy","","17","","23","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A standard imager is mounted next to a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) on a Pan-Tilt Unit. The output of the DVS is fed to an event-based Selective Attention Chip that implements a Winner-Take-All network with inhibition of return, to identify and sequentially select the most salient regions in the visual input space, and drive the Pan-Tilt Unit accordingly.

Since television has a proven impact on consumer purchase behaviors, there is commercial interest in technologies that model viewers' intent, interests and engagement. However, the ecosystem currently faces two challenges - audience fragmentation and a lack of integrated search features. Both have an impact on content providers' ability to track and profile their consumers and are thus critical to personalizing and monetizing content-related services. In this paper, we introduce CollecTV, a social search solution for TV and video queries that can mitigate these concerns by incentivizing the consumer to adopt consistent identities across three screens while also providing finer-grained attention and engagement analytics to content providers. We give an overview of the architecture and describe the evolution of the system from a TV-centric solution to a 3-screen model with native mobile and browser clients to maximize its usage and utility. We conclude by reviewing relevant research and outlining challenges and opportunities for further exploration in this space.","","Electronic:978-0-9845893-2-6","10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5767036","collaborative question-answering;interactive television;recommender systems;social search","Biological system modeling;Browsers;Communities;Context;Engines;Mobile communication;TV","interactive television;query processing;question answering (information retrieval);recommender systems;social networking (online)","3-screen model;3-screen social search system;CollecTV intelligence;TV query;TV-centric solution;audience fragmentation;browser client;consumer purchase behaviors;content providers ability;content-related services;ecosystem;engagement analytics;finer-grained attention;integrated search features;mobile client;social search solution;video query","","1","1","13","","","9-12 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the ether hand, data suggests that users are becoming increasingly disenchanted with search engines that don't actually search the Web, but rather search records of the Web sites their robots have visited. Some online merchants (Victoria's Secret, for example) don't even enable keyword searches on their sites. The Web's increasingly dynamic nature complicates searching.

Therefore, the need to provide information that is significant to the user arises, which leads to the use of information adaptation, process in which a service is enriched with a set of characteristics. This process tailors information obtained from the context in which the interaction between the user and the system is taking place. However, it is difficult to find a generic environment that allows the mentioned process in any kind of scenario because it generally depends on the user's needs and on the conditions present in his/her interaction with the system. Due to adaptation, the user can receive in the most appropriate way information when and where he/she needs it.

These approaches, however, assume that sensors are uniformly distributed in the sensor field, which is seldom true in real applications. Also they do not allow tuning the redundancy level in the storage according to the importance of the data to be stored. To deal with these issues, we propose an approach based on two mechanisms. The first is aimed at estimating the real network distribution. The second exploits data dispersal method based on the estimated network distribution.

"Use of Artificial Neural Networks to Retrieve TOA SW Radiative Fluxes for the EarthCARE Mission","C. Domenech; T.

The fundamental mission objective is to constrain retrievals of cloud and aerosol properties such that their impact on top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes can be determined with an accuracy of 10 W · m<sup>-2</sup>. However, TOA fluxes cannot be measured instantaneously from a satellite. For the EarthCARE mission, fluxes will be estimated from the observed solar and thermal radiances measured by the Broadband Radiometer (BBR). This paper describes an approach to obtain shortwave (SW) fluxes from BBR radiance measurements. The retrieval algorithms are developed relying on the angular distribution models (ADMs) employed by Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument. The solar radiance-to-flux conversion for the BBR is performed by simulating the Terra CERES ADMs us ing a backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The ANN performance is optimized by testing different architectures, namely, feedforward, cascade forward, and a customized forward network. A large data set of CERES measurements used to resemble the forthcoming BBR acquisitions has been collected.

"NextGen and SESAR moving towards ontology-based software development","E. Gringinger; D. Eier; D. Merkl","FREQUENTIS AG, Vienna, Austria","2011 Integrated Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance Conference Proceedings","20110630","2011","","","H3-1","H3-10","The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and EUROCONTROL's Single European Sky ATM Research Program (SESAR) are transforming the global Air Traffic Management (ATM) as we know it today and will break up with existing roles predicated by 50 year old technology. Similar to SESAR, NextGen right now runs the risk to specify ATM systems based on architectures already out-of-date. While current functionality is based on historical grown technical restrictions, a performance-based and most efficient approach requires new paradigms and eventually has to lead to a balanced approach to prevent over-optimizing one area at the expense of others. The new approach should be based on semantically enriched service models allowing easier development and modular applications for multiple domains. This paper describes an ontology based multi-domain software development approach called Ontology-Based-Control-Room-Framework (ONTOCOR) featuring high software code re-usage and rapid development. It focuses on improving efficiency and increasing the code reusability in order to achieve SESAR's and NextGen's claim for a performance-based and cost-efficient system. The main goal is using semantic technologies to enhance software development in ATM and further, to define tasks with enough similarity to allow applicability in different domains. ONTOCOR uses semantic standards and tools, and seamless information interchange. As described in the European Air Traffic Management Master Plan, “The Information Management Work Package (...) defines the ATM Information Reference Model and the Information Service model (...) by establishing a framework, which defines seamless information interchange between all providers and users of shared ATM information”. A specific example to implement inter domain, is the European ATM Information Reference Model (AIRM). In general, domain independent implementation of components is a future- - goal and EUROCONTROL defines AIRM as a model, which contains all of the ATM information to be shared in a semantic way. The paper will discuss a first case study for ontology-based modeling and development, a service for digital notices to airmen (NOTAM). Fast information distribution and retrieval are key elements together with service modeling and definitions according to Enterprise Architecture (EA) and SOA principles. Aeronautical Information Management (AIM) using ontologies, provides the benefit of fast ramp up of on-the-spot services, reduced development efforts and additional defined data as source for collaborative decision making within the System-Wide Information Management (SWIM). Such services deployed in NextGen and SESAR will optimize operations workflow, communication needs, and information sharing.","2155-4943;21554943","Electronic:978-1-4577-0592-2; POD:978-1-4577-0593-9","10.1109/ICNSURV.2011.5935286","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935286","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Atmospheric modeling;OWL;Ontologies;Programming;Semantics;Software","aerospace computing;air traffic;avionics;electronic data interchange;groupware;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);program compilers;software architecture;software performance evaluation;software reusability;workflow management software","AIM;AIRM;ATM systems;EUROCONTROL;European ATM information reference model;European air traffic management master plan;Federal Aviation Administration;NOTAM;NextGen;ONTOCOR;SESAR;SOA;SWIM;Single European Sky ATM Research Program;aeronautical information management;code reusability;collaborative decision making;communication needs;cost-efficient system;digital notices to airmen;domain independent implementation;enterprise architecture;global air traffic management;historical grown technical restrictions;inforation retrieval;information distribution;information management work package;information service model;information sharing;next generation air transportation system;ontology based multidomain software development approach;ontology-based modeling and development;ontology-based software development;ontology-based-control-room-framework;operations workflow;performance-based system;rapid development;seamless information interchange;semantic standards;semantic technology;semantic tools;semantically enriched service models;service modeling;software code reusage;system-wide information management","","5","","38","","","10-12 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The temperature is measured in the real time by the sensor boards that sample and send the data to the monitoring computer through a base station or gateway. This paper proposes how such monitoring system can be setup emphasizing on the aspects of low cost, energy-efficient, easy ad-hoc installation and easy handling and maintenance. This paper focuses on the overall potential of wireless sensor nodes and networking in industrial applications. A specific case study is given for the measurement of temperature (with thermistor or thermocouple), humidity, light and the health of the WSN. The focus was not on these four types of measurements and analysis but rather on the design of a communication protocol and building of an HMI software for monitoring.

However, amid all these advances, performance of clouds and cloud services continues to present challenges. Access latencies to the information on the cloud due to variable bandwidth continues to be a serious problem of research; more so in environments requiring mobile devices to stay connected to the cloud. One way to smooth out bumps in bandwidth available is to use anticipatory retrieval of data, and to cache data that is likely to be requested later. The proposed anticipatory retrieval and caching system is a solution that takes this path. It offers a better experience to those mobile users who are connected to a cloud and make frequent access to the cloud's datastore. The proposed method aims to provide ubiquitous access to data on clouds regardless of the bandwidth levels. This is done by locally caching all the one-hop related item-sets I<sub>1</sub>; I<sub>2</sub>; ... ; I<sub>k</sub> semantically belonging to (or semantically linked to) a particular item-set I'. Caching is done asynchronously in the background during times of high bandwidth. The proposed algorithms assess the semantic relevance of the data using semantic distances along with user priorities and availability of bandwidth, and then prioritizes anticipatory data downloads on to the cloud's storage based on the relevance quotient.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9493-4; POD:978-1-4244-9494-1","10.1109/SYSCON.2011.5929049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929049","anticipatory downloads;cloud computing;data cloud;mobile systems;semantic link network;variable bandwidth","Availability;Bandwidth;Data models;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Prefetching;Semantics","cache storage;cloud computing;information retrieval;mobile computing","anticipatory retrieval;cloud computing;cloud services;data caching;data retrieval;mobile device;ubiquitous access;variable bandwidth environment","","4","1","14","","","4-7 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a security property on the where-dimension of declassification and present an enforcement based on automated verification. The approach automatically transforms the abstract model with a variant of self-composition, and checks the reachability of illegal-flow state of the model after transformation. The self-composition is equipped with a store-match pattern to reduce the state space and to model the equivalence of declassified expressions in the premise of property.

A simple approach to this problem would be to recompute the best path for all queries on arrival of every delay update. However, such a naive approach scales poorly when there are many users who have requested routes in the system. Instead, we propose two new classes of approximate techniques - K-paths and proximity measures to substantially speed up processing of the set of designated routes specified by continuous route planning queries in the face of incoming traffic delay updates. Our techniques work through a combination of pre-computation of likely good paths and by avoiding complete recalculations on every delay update, instead only sending the user new routes when delays change significantly. Based on an experimental evaluation with 7,000 drives from real taxi cabs, we found that the routes delivered by our techniques are within 5% of the best shortest path and have run times an order of magnitude or less compared to a naive approach.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4244-8960-2; POD:978-1-4244-8959-6; USB:978-1-4244-8958-9","10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5767844","","Delay;Heuristic algorithms;Monitoring;Planning;Real time systems;Roads;Routing","question answering (information retrieval);road traffic;traffic engineering computing","K-path technique;continuous route planning query answering system;dynamic route planning;proximity measures;road network;traffic delay updates","","9","","39","","","11-16 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DHT can retrieve the records from database, only when an exact match is found and complex queries are not supported. One of the solutions to support complex queries is to build Index on the top of DHTs. But the existing Indexing-Based DHT such as Prefix Hash Tree (PHT) also suffer from query inefficiency and high maintenance cost. An efficient indexing scheme namely LIGhtweight Hash Tree (LIGHT) is proposed here for supporting complex queries.

However, it is difficult for users to retrieve relevant teaching material in cloud environments by submitting a few keywords. We propose a search mechanism based on social networks. Furthermore, the issues of availability and trustworthiness have to be considered in teaching material retrieval process, in order to improve the retrieval performance. Current P2P file sharing applications focus on exact matching and ignore the dynamic nature inherent in P2P networks, which might degrade the retrieval performance in terms of precision and response time. Our idea is to appropriately set the due time to improve response time of P2P teaching material retrieval without sacrificing much precision. In this study, we formulate the due time setting problem as a bi-objective optimization problem and approximately solve it by an interaction-based heuristic method. The proposed approach consists of two phases: construction phase and sharing phase. In construction phase, peer information is acquired and managed in a decentralized manner. In sharing phase, the due time is interactively determined and the results are retrieved. A prototype of cloud platform has been constructed and experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the approach. The experimental results show that the interactive algorithm performs well in P2P networks with low trust and availability. Also, a survey of satisfaction shows that the proposed method is more user-friendly.","2162-9048;21629048","Electronic:978-1-4244-9224-4; POD:978-1-4244-9222-0; USB:978-1-4244-9223-7","10.1109/ICISA.2011.5772397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5772397","","Availability;Education;Materials;Peer to peer computing;Social network services;Time factors","cloud computing;information retrieval;optimisation;peer-to-peer computing","P2P file sharing applications;biobjective optimization problem;cloud computing environments;educational videos;peer-to-peer retrieval;social networks;teaching material;teaching material retrieval process","","1","","20","","","26-29 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Resolution enhancement algorithms designed for QuikSCAT allow for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) (2.5 km) simultaneous wind and rain (SWR) retrieval. The principle advantage of UHR SWR estimation is that compared to conventional resolution, the higher resolution allows for identification of much smaller rain events and their effects on the wind field. To enable SWR retrieval, we adjust the geophysical model function to account for rain effects such as attenuation and increased backscatter due to increased surface roughness. Two possible rain models are proposed, a phenomenological rain model and an effective rain model. Both models are compared by evaluating data fit and rain estimation performance. Comparisons of a co-located data set show that QuikSCAT UHR SWR integrated rain rates are comparable to those from tropical rain measuring mission precipitation radar (TRMM PR) but have higher variance. Buoy comparisons reveal improved wind estimates in the presence of rain. The theoretic estimator bounds are compared to both the simulated estimator variance and the actual estimator variance. The estimator bounds indicate that despite high-noise levels, wind and rain information is still retrievable at UHR, although certain directions have degraded estimator bounds. Both rain models are compared to truth data and are shown to have comparable performance for most rain rates. Comparison with buoy measurements shows that in the presence of rain, QuikSCAT UHR SWR wind estimates have less bias and variability than wind-only estimates. Although QuikSCAT UHR SWR rain estimates are noisier than TRMM PR rain rates, they provide a useful rain flag for QuikSCAT winds.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2102361","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710413","QuikSCAT;resolution enhancement;scatterometry;simultaneous wind/rain retrieval;wind retrieval","Antenna measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Attenuation;Backscatter;Geophysical measurements;Rain;Spatial resolution","atmospheric measuring apparatus;information retrieval;rain;remote sensing by radar;surface roughness;wind","QuikSCAT UHR SWR rain estimates;TRMM PR rain rates;Tropical Rain Measuring Mission precipitation radar;attenuation;backscatter;effective rain model;phenomenological rain model;rain flag;resolution enhancement algorithms;simultaneous wind-rain retrieval;surface roughness;ultra-high resolution QuikSCAT scatterometer;wind field","","10","","25","","20110207","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the research line of Computational Theory of Perceptions, we have created the Granular Linguistic Model of a Phenomenon. It is a data structure that allows computational systems to generate linguistic descriptions of input data. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of using OLAP to navigate in this structure of information. Inspired in the way humans use NL, we adapt the typical operations in OLAP, namely, drilling, rolling and slicing/dicing, to navigate by hierarchical granular structures of fuzzy perceptions. The long term aim is to create a new type of human computer interface that will assist users in the analysis of the likely huge amount of available information about relevant phenomena.

Encryption is a well established technology for protecting sensitive data. But it gives some new problems: how data owner and storage service provider to operate on encrypted data? How to reduce data owner's workload of data management and support data sharing at the same time? If they can't be easy to resolved, encryption will bring a lot of troubles to people. In this paper, we design a privacy-preserving cloud storage framework to solve those problems. We design an interaction protocol among participants, adopt key derivation algorithm to generate and manage keys, use the combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption to hide the sensitive data of users, and apply Bloom filter to realize cipher text retrieval.

In each case, overall system performance can be improved significantly by first identifying and then exploiting the structure of community's data access patterns. We propose a novel perspective for analyzing data access workloads that considers the implicit relationships that form among users based on the data they access. We propose a new structure-the interest-sharing graph-that captures common user interests in data and justify its utility with studies on four data-sharing systems: a high-energy physics collaboration, the Web, the Kazaa peer-to-peer network, and a BitTorrent file-sharing community. We find small-world patterns in the interest-sharing graphs of all four communities. We investigate analytically and experimentally some of the potential causes that lead to this pattern and conclude that user preferences play a major role. The significance of small-world patterns is twofold: it provides a rigorous support to intuition and it suggests the potential to exploit these naturally emerging patterns. As a proof of concept, we design and evaluate an information dissemination system that exploits the small-world interest-sharing graphs by building an interest-aware network overlay. We show that this approach leads to improved information dissemination performance.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601708","File sharing;peer-to-peer systems.;self-organization;small-world graphs;workload characterization","Collaboration;Communities;Distributed databases;Internet;Peer to peer computing;Physics;Protocols","Internet;information dissemination;information retrieval;peer-to-peer computing","BitTorrent file-sharing community;Kazaa peer-to-peer network;Web caches;community data access patterns;content distribution networks;data grids;distributed file systems;high-energy physics collaboration;information dissemination system;interest-aware network overlay;interest-sharing graph;peer-to-peer file-sharing networks","","20","","64","","20101014","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the unpredictable cost of data access in large-scale computing infrastructures can lead to severe performance bottlenecks. Providing predictability in data access is, thus, essential to accommodate the large set of newly emerging large-scale, data-intensive computing applications. In this regard, accurate estimation of network performance is crucial to meeting the performance goals of such applications. Passive estimation based on past measurements is attractive for its relatively small overhead compared to relying on explicit probing. In this paper, we take a passive approach for network performance estimation. Our approach is different from existing passive techniques that rely either on past direct measurements of pairs of nodes or on topological similarities. Instead, we exploit secondhand measurements collected by other nodes without any topological restrictions. In this paper, we present Overlay Passive Estimation of Network performance (OPEN), a scalable framework providing end-to-end network performance estimation based on secondhand measurements, and discuss how OPEN achieves cost-effective estimation in a large-scale infrastructure. Our extensive experimental results show that OPEN estimation can be applicable for replica and resource selections commonly used in distributed computing.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5629337","Network performance estimation;data-intensive computing;replica selection;resource selection.;secondhand estimation","Distributed databases;Estimation;Extraterrestrial measurements;Optimization;Peer to peer computing;Servers","information retrieval;parallel processing","OPEN;data access;data intensive computing;distributed computing applications;distributed data sources;end-to-end network performance estimation;large-scale computing infrastructure;overlay passive estimation of network performance;passive network performance estimation;performance bottlenecks","","3","","34","","20101111","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence, in this paper, we propose a feature selection method for detecting music mood scores. In the proposed method, features which have strong correlation with mood scores are selected from a lot of features. Then, these are input into Multi-Layer Neural Networks (MLNNs) and mood scores are detected every mood labels.
