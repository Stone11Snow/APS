To address this issue, we analyzed three years of filelevel activities from the NCAR mass storage system, providing valuable insight into a large-scale scientific archive with over 1600 users, tens of millions of files, and petabytes of data. Our examination of system usage showed that, while a subset of users were responsible for most of the activity, this activity was widely distributed at the file level. We also show that the physical grouping of files and directories on media can improve archival storage system performance.

However, existing ESN platforms do not have good support to this process. In this paper, we propose a method to better support question & answer on ESN, purely by using a graph analysis approach. Based on the questioner's initial input list of potential answerers, it can extract a shared-interest group of people, whose interest is close to the initial list of potential answerers, and sort the group of people according to a score of interest distance, and then recommend them to the questioner. To evaluate its applicability, the method is implemented in KDWeibo the most popular ESN platform in China, and the results are promising.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4897-5; POD:978-1-4673-4825-6","10.1109/APSCC.2012.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6478210","Enterprise Social Network;Graph Analysis;Question &amp; Answer;Recommender System;Shared Interest","Algorithm design and analysis;Blogs;Collaboration;Companies;Engines;Social network services;User interfaces","business data processing;graph theory;question answering (information retrieval);recommender systems;social networking (online)","China;ESN service;KDWeibo;enterprise social network;graph analysis approach;question-and-answer;score-of-interest distance;shared-interest group","","1","","28","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Next, non-month words are segmented into individual components and classified into one of alphabet, digit or punctuation. Using this information of word and character level components, the date patterns are searched first using voting approach and then we detect the candidate lines for numeric and semi-numeric date using regular expression.

Besides defining an ontology in terms of concepts and relations, the actual process of populating an ontology with individuals has become a more and more time-consuming task due to the multitude of information sources. Therefore, the extraction of proper individuals may be very difficult when one is dealing with such amount of information freely available on the web and with so many classes within the hierarchy. On the other side, the classical approach of populating ontologies consists of parsing the input and matching it against certain regular expressions. Due to its intrinsic limitations, we propose a novel approach based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm that is used to create rules by reading the predefined ontologies (mostly generated via expert knowledge) and later to apply them on the given text. The ants build individuals iteratively by searching keywords in the text that better fit as values for the attributes defined within each ontology class. The validation results prove that our method provides more specific individuals than classic pattern matching techniques as the algorithm scans every word from the text in order to compare it against a list of keywords.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4934-7; POD:978-1-4673-5026-6","10.1109/SYNASC.2012.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6481034","Ant Colony Optimization;data mining;ontology;pattern matching","Ant colony optimization;Classification algorithms;Context;Data mining;Ontologies;Pattern matching;Semantics","ant colony optimisation;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;semantic Web;social networking (online);text analysis","ACO algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithm;automatic evaluation;automatic ontology populating;individual extraction;information retrieval systems;information sources;information structuring;keyword searching;knowledge bases;ontology class;pattern matching techniques;semantic repositories;semantic web;social Web;text scanning algorithm;time-consuming task","","0","","11","","","26-29 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtual honeypots replicating those systems are then created and deployed on the network. Suspicious traffic destined for the target system is then redirected to the newly created honeypot. Dormant honeypots are deleted periodically. Honeydoop can also be used to analyze existing honeypot logs.","","Electronic:978-1-908320-08-7; POD:978-1-4673-5325-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470917","Hadoop;Honeypots;Virtual Honeypots","Databases;Organizations;Switches","data analysis;information retrieval;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Honeydoop;IDS alerts;data analyzer Hadoop;dormant honeypots;information analysis;information retrieval;network traffic analysis;on-demand virtual high interaction honeypots;virtual honeypots","","1","","7","","","10-12 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the abundant existing works on (high-probability) completion time of gossiping processes, it remains an interesting, important, and largely unaddressed problem how to select the initial information sources for gossiping, so as to maximize the expected spreading or minimize the expected completion time. In this paper, we deal with problems related to selecting influential information sources, which are initially informed nodes in a network for gossiping. The considered problems include the gossip spreading maximization problem (GSMP) and the completion time minimization problem (CTMP). Both problems are conjectured to be at least NP-hard, whereas a greedy algorithm for GSMP is proposed to guarantee an approximation factor of (1-1/e), due to the inherent submodularity property of GSMP. Additionally, based on an all-ordered-pair matrix, three heuristics are proposed for solving CTMP. Throughout the analysis and development, a key observation is that there exists an equivalent view that relates the expected gossiping time to the expected shortest path length in a random weighted directed graph induced by virtual coupon collectors run at each node in the network graph.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4539-2; POD:978-1-4673-4537-8","10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483387","","Approximation methods;Complexity theory;Delays;Greedy algorithms;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Sociology","approximation theory;communication complexity;directed graphs;greedy algorithms;information dissemination;information retrieval;minimisation;network theory (graphs);next generation networks;probability","CTMP;GSMP;NP-hard;all-ordered-pair matrix;approximation factor;completion time minimization problem;gossip spreading maximization problem;gossiping process;gossiping time;gossiping-based scheme;greedy algorithm;heuristics;high-probability completion time;information dissemination;information source extraction;network graph;next generation network;random weighted directed graph;rumor spreading;shortest path length;submodularity property;virtual coupon collector","","1","","20","","","1-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The data harvested from the CRDW is obtained by cleansing transactional clinical databases (TCD) used for daily clinical activities. Traditionally, TCD schema and CRDW data models only capture conceptual patient data, often neglecting to address the contextual and semantic information attached to such data that is crucial for clinical analysis.

As different organizations share their resources and skills in a disaster situation, the concepts related to collaborative networks become more relevant. Under such conditions, one of the issues is related to the efficient partner or team member selection as applicable in the case of collaborative networks. Although different partner selection mechanisms have been proposed in the literature of collaborative networks but considering the dynamic context of trust, these cannot be applied directly in the disaster management situation. Trust and reputation have been identified as one of the important factors for the efficient disaster management in the related literature. The current work focuses on the development of a reputation management system for efficient selection of disaster management team. For this, a framework identifies important factors having impact on the reputation and trust of a particular partner working in collaboration with other organizations, proposes a Service Oriented Architecture to extract information from information sources and finally proposes an algorithm for calculating the reputation score.

This paper introduces FAST (Fingergestures Authentication System using Touchscreen), a novel touchscreen based authentication approach on mobile devices. Besides extracting touch data from touchscreen equipped smartphones, FAST complements and validates this data using a digital sensor glove that we have built using off-the-shelf components. FAST leverages state-of-the-art classification algorithms to provide transparent and continuous mobile system protection. A notable feature is FAST 's continuous, user transparent post-login authentication. We use touch data collected from 40 users to show that FAST achieves a False Accept Rate (FAR) of 4.66% and False Reject Rate of 0.13% for the continuous post-login user authentication. The low FAR and FRR values indicate that FAST provides excellent post-login access security, without disturbing the honest mobile users.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2709-1; POD:978-1-4673-2708-4","10.1109/THS.2012.6459891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459891","Hand-held device;touch-screen;user-authentication","Authentication;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Mobile communication;Smart phones","authorisation;data gloves;gesture recognition;information retrieval;mobile computing;mobile handsets;pattern classification;touch sensitive screens","FAR values;FAST complements;FAST continuous user transparent post-login authentication;FRR values;continuous mobile authentication;continuous mobile system protection;continuous post-login user authentication;data validation;digital sensor glove;false accept rate;false reject rate;finger-gestures authentication system using touchscreen;honest mobile users;off-the-shelf components;post-login access security;sensitive data access;sensitive data storage;state-of-the-art classification algorithms;touchscreen equipped smart phones;touchscreen gestures;touchscreen-based user authentication approach;transparent mobile system protection","","64","2","21","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Relevant feature extraction is the foremost problem in the preprocessing stage. SentiWordNet is an ontology that includes numeric scores related to the positive or negative aspects of the words. The work in this paper explores the use of SentiWordNet to extract sentiment features of the words in the song lyrics. The experiments are carried out on a collection of 185 lyrics each belonging to one of the four classes. Three classification algorithms namely, Naïve Bayesian (NB), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) using six measures for attribute relevance analysis namely, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Chi-Square (CS), Information Gain (IG), GINI Index (GI) and Gain Ratio (GR) have been applied to model the classifiers. The experiments examine the relevance of the sentiment features for classification. The ratio of the positive and negative scores, normalized ratio, and average of the positive and negative scores are three sentiment features. The experimental results indicate that the Naïve Bayesian classifier using the average of the positive and negative score as sentiment feature, and gain ratio as feature selection criteria achieve 78.27% accuracy based on top 10% of the features. The second best accuracy has been achieved by SVM-based classifiers using the average of the positive and negative score as sentiment feature and top 10% features applying all feature selection criteria except CS.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2907-1; POD:978-1-4673-2906-4","10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466307","Feature Reduction;Lyrics;Mood Classification;SentiWordNet;Sentiment Feature","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computers;Feature extraction;Mood;Niobium;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;feature extraction;information retrieval;music;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;principal component analysis;support vector machines;text analysis","Chi-Square classifiers;GINI index;KNN classifiers;LSA;Naive Bayesian classifier;SVM-based classifiers;SentiWordNet;attribute relevance analysis;classification algorithms;document classification;feature selection criteria;gain ratio;information gain;k-nearest neighbor classifiers;latent semantic analysis;lyrics mood classification;numeric scores;ontology;principal component analysis;sentiment feature extraction;support vector machine;text data","","1","","19","","","4-6 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The three distances between each SSs couple are used in searching and in the voting process. The barycenter of the motif is assigned as the Reference Point (RP). All motif triangles are compared with all possible triangles in the macromolecule. The lengths of triangle edges are used as selective parameters. For every correspondence a vote is given to the point which is figured out as motif barycenter with a special mapping rule and the point having most votes is determined as candidate RP. In this paper we made some experiments for retrieval of four- and five-SSs motif from the macromolecule.

Several global data sets are available for this purpose. They are produced using different algorithms and/or satellite sensors. This paper compares and analyzes three multitemporal fAPAR data sets derived from SPOT-VEGETATION instrument by explicitly distinguishing between spatial and temporal agreement. The first two data sets are currently used by the Joint Research Centre-Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS Unit (JRC-MARS) for operational yield forecasting and food security assessments. The third time series (named GEOV1) is from a new processing algorithm developed within the European FP7 Geoland2 project. The comparative analysis was conducted for the years 2003 and 2004 over three 10° × 10° regions with different eco-climatic characteristics (Niger, Brazil, and France). Our study revealed that GEOV1 fAPAR estimates were systematically higher than those of JRC-MARS. The spatial analysis showed moderate to high agreement between data sets with specific seasonality in the three study regions. The temporal agreement showed spatial (and land cover-related) variability spanning from very low to almost perfect. Large differences were observed in regions and periods with large cloud occurrence where GEOV1 provides more reliable and smooth temporal profiles due to improved cloud screening and longer compositing periods. Other sources of disagreement between data sets were identified in differences in the fAPAR retrieval algorithm definitions.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2212447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6311460","CYCLight;GEOV1-Geoland2;JRC-FAPAR;SPOT-VEGETATION (VGT);fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR);multitemporal remote sensing (RS) data","Monitoring;Photosynthetically active radiation;Radiation;Satellite communication;Sensors;Time series analysis;Vegetation mapping","clouds;geophysics computing;information retrieval;remote sensing;time series;vegetation;vegetation mapping","AD 2003 to 2004;Brazil;European FP7 Geoland2 project;France;GEOV1 fAPAR estimates;JRC-MARS;Niger;absorbed photosynthetically active radiation;cloud screening;compositing periods;ecoclimatic characteristics;fAPAR retrieval algorithm definitions;food security assessments;global data sets;joint research centre-monitoring agricultural resources unit;land cover-related variability;multitemporal fAPAR data sets;operational yield forecasting;processing algorithm;satellite-derived time series;space remote sensing spot-vegetation fAPAR time series;spatial agreement;spatial variability;specific seasonality;temporal agreement;vegetation anomalies;vegetation dynamics","","20","","45","","20120924","April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A good example of this can be seen in Flickr, in general and Flickr Group in particular where users can comment on or “like” an image contributed by another user. This paper looks at utilizing this within group user-user interaction information, along with image meta-data to discover user communities (user-subgroups) that contribute content around specific topics (subgroup-themes) at specific points in time. A good example of this is a group of users (e.g sports fans) contributing content and interacting with each other only at specific times of the year (e.g close to their favorite sporting event).

Based on the needs, this paper introduces a novel approach of amplitude independent content-based retrieval system for audio format through speech data. In this study, the input is audio query which is getting through real time or existing data. According to the previous studies, speech retrieval is done with the help of transcribed units, which causes lack of system accuracy. This research work is proposed to increase the efficiency of the retrieval system. Features are used to match the acoustic similarities between the queries with existing documents in the corpus. Furthermore, to fulfill the system efficiency and accuracy requirements, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and formant feature extraction will be used for feature extraction. The resultant average output of these features will be provided to support vector machine for classification purpose, by considering every average value as a single feature value.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2925-5; POD:978-1-4673-2922-4","10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449936","formatting;insert;style;styling","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Robustness;Speech;Support vector machines","audio signal processing;feature extraction;information retrieval;multimedia systems;speech processing","amplitude independent feature extraction;audio format;digital data;formant feature extraction;mel frequency cepstral coefficients;multimedia format;speech retrieval;spoken word retrieval","","0","","13","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed method, a research ontology is firstly constructed to standardize research keywords. Secondly, frequent item sets with different support degrees are extracted from research proposals based on research ontology. Thirdly, a new measure of similarity degree between two research proposals is developed and then a clustering algorithm is proposed to classify research proposals based on the similarity degree, in which some parameters are discussed, and the proper parameters are selected. Finally, when the number of research proposals in some clusters is still large, research proposals are further divided into small groups, in which the number of research proposals is approximately equal. The proposed method is validated based on the selection process at the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC).

Our puppet interface does not require any special devices and any type of puppet can be used. The puppet interface is developed by attaching ten visible markers onto a puppet. The user can manipulate the pose of the puppet interface to produce the desired motion in front of a camera. The puppet's joint angle information is captured by the camera and used to retrieve a suitable motion from a motion database. The retrieved motion data is transferred to a 3D character model to generate an animation. To avoid the occlusion problem, we propose an algorithm that estimates the joint angle by determining the position and rotation of markers adjacent to the occluded marker. Experiments confirmed that our proposed algorithm can generate correct results, although some occluded markers remained.","1051-4651;10514651","Electronic:978-4-9906441-0-9; POD:978-1-4673-2216-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6460829","","Animation;Databases;Equations;Joints;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Vectors","cameras;computer animation;information retrieval;pose estimation","3D character model;camera;intuitive computer animation system development;joint angle estimatation;motion data retrieval;motion database;puppet interface;puppet joint angle information;puppet pose manipulation;visible marker position determination;visible marker rotation determination","","0","","12","","","11-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We especially searched for the phrases, such as “vision sensor”, “motion tracking”, “gait disorder”, and “rehabilitation” in the title, abstract, or keywords sections. Besides, some common synonyms of these phrases, along with the logical words, like “and”, “or”, and “not” were also used in the article searching procedure. From among the 37 articles found, this review identified 25 articles, which utilized the marker during video recording for motion tracking of the subject; whereas about 10 articles did not utilize any marker, 1 article utilized both marker-based and markerless, and another 1 articles were unrelated to the motion tracking but related to the gait disorder. Moreover, through this literature, we presented a strong evidence that enabled the analysis of motion tracking by the help of vision sensor for the rehabilitation systems of gait disorder.

Protein structure comparison is important for understanding the evolutionary relationships among proteins, predicting protein functions, and predicting protein structures from the chemical composition. In this paper we propose a new approach for structural block retrieval based on the Generalized Hough Transform (GHT). A first technique uses as primitives the single Secondary Structure (SS), an alternative adopts co-occurrence of SSs couple, the third approach uses SSs triplets, and finally the primitive can be an entire block.

The DCS scheme, however, might incur high update traffic due to the lack of an optimally synchronized routing algorithm. This paper presents a new distributed Sector Based Distance (SBD) routing algorithm that has been designed for a low power DCS implementation. In order to guarantee reliability and minimizing end-to-end latency, a simple Grid Coloring Algorithm (GCA) is used to derive the time division multiple access (TDMA) schedules. The GCA uses a slot reuse concept to achieve minimum TDMA frame length. Extensive simulations demonstrate that SBD yields significant improvement in achieving high reliability and low latency while providing optimal energy consumption.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4723-5; POD:978-1-4673-4721-1","10.1109/NESEA.2012.6474019","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474019","Data Centric Storage;Energy Consumption;Local Update;Remote Update;Sector Head","Algorithm design and analysis;Energy consumption;Routing;Routing protocols;Time division multiple access;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","information retrieval systems;synchronisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;time division multiple access;wireless sensor networks","data centric storage;distributed sector based distance routing algorithm;end-to-end latency;external storage;grid coloring algorithm;local storage;low power DCS implementation;minimum TDMA frame length;optimal energy consumption;optimally synchronized routing algorithm;optimized TDMA based distance routing;slot reuse concept;time division multiple access schedules;wireless sensor network","","2","","19","","","13-14 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MapReduce not only can be used as an ETL tool, it can do even much more. The technique has been applied to SQL summation, OLAP, data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, multimedia data processing, science data processing etc. Basically MapReduce is a general purpose parallel computing framework for large dataset processing. A big data analytics ecosystem built around MapReduce is emerging alongside the traditional one built around RDBMS. The objectives of RDBMS and MapReduce, as well as the ecosystems built around them, overlap much really, in some sense they do the same thing and MapReduce can accomplish more works, such as graph processing, which RDBMS can not handle well. RBDMS enjoys high performance of relational data processing, which MapReduce needs to catch up. The authors envision that the two techniques are fusing into a unified system for big data analytics. With the ongoing endeavor to build up the system, much of the groundwork has been laid while some critical issues are still unresolved, we try to identify some of them.

The approach is based on the Analytical Network Process, which is a popular approach in Operational Research, but never applied for fusion before. The approach benefits from two major ideas; interdependency between classes and dependency of classes on the features. Experiments conducted on CCV dataset demonstrate that proposed approach outperforms linear combination and other simple approaches, moreover it is less-dependent on the selection of weights.","1051-4651;10514651","Electronic:978-4-9906441-0-9; POD:978-1-4673-2216-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6460115","","Accuracy;Ear;Educational institutions;Linearity;Multimedia communication;Support vector machines;Training","information retrieval;operations research;sensor fusion","CCV dataset;analytical network process;linear combination;multimodal information fusion;nonlinear extension;nonlinear weighted average;operational research;weight selection","","0","","13","","","11-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the traditional encryption schemes are inadequate since they make the application of indexing and searching operations more challenging tasks. Accordingly, searchable encryption systems are developed to conduct search operations over a set of encrypted data. Unfortunately, these systems only allow their clients to perform an exact search but not approximate search, an important need for all the current information retrieval systems. Recently, an increased attention has been paid to the approximate searchable encryption systems to find keywords that match the submitted queries approximately. Our work focuses on constructing a flexible secure index that allows the cloud server to perform the approximate search operations without revealing the content of the query trapdoor or the index content. Specifically, the most recently cryptographic primitive, order preserving symmetric encryption (OPSE), has been employed to protect our keywords. Our proposed scheme divides the search operation into two steps. The first step finds the candidate list in terms of secure pruning codes. In particular, we have developed two methods to construct these pruning codes. The second step uses a semi honest third party to determine the best matching keyword depending on secure similarity function. We intend to reveal as little information as possible to that third party. We hope that developing such a system will enhance the utilization of retrieval information systems and make these systems more user-friendly.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4809-8; POD:978-1-4673-2601-8","10.1109/ICEBE.2012.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6468245","Cloud security;encryption;order preserving symmetric encryption;privacy protection","Encryption;Indexes;Public key;Servers;Vectors","approximation theory;cloud computing;cryptography;information retrieval systems;search problems","OPSE;approximate keyword based search;cloud data encryption;cloud outsourcing;cloud server;index content;information retrieval systems;order preserving symmetric encryption;privacy protection;pruning code security;search approximation;search operation;search operations;searchable encryption systems;sensitive data","","1","","21","","","9-11 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important element in supporting shared access is coordinating the scheduling of the laboratory usage. Optimized scheduling can significantly decrease access waiting times and improve the utilization level of RL resources, with associated reductions in per-use costs. Current RL systems have typically supported scheduling based on either reservations or queuing, though rarely both. In this paper, we investigate issues that arise when a single RL resource (or pool of resources) supports both modes for gaining access, and how these two approaches can be effectively integrated. This research analyzes the scheduling algorithm utilized by the Sahara RL system to investigate any limitations that affect the system utilization. We identify a number of current issues and propose specific modifications to address them.

However, some limitations have been uncovered in the use of a vertical search (especially top-down) to form a set of domain categories. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a horizontal search method, and uses Wikipedia components to measure the similarity between categories. In an experimental evaluation, we confirm that our method shows a wide coverage and high precision for similar (domain) category grouping.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4865-4; POD:978-1-4673-5146-1","10.1109/GreenCom.2012.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6468397","Wikipedia category;category grouping;horizontal search;similarity measure","Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Search methods;Semantic Web;Semantics","Web sites;information retrieval;search problems","category hierarchy;category similarity;data reliability;domain categories;horizontal search method;semantic information processing;similar category grouping;similar domain grouping;wikipedia category grouping","","0","","13","","","20-23 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Storage services such as Dropbox and iCloud enabled us to share files among multiple users or devices. Providing the benefits of network coding in distributed systems such as Peer-to-Peer file sharing and multimedia streaming, researchers have also been trying to apply network coding in storage systems. Existing works have been focusing on mechanisms for preserving the level of redundancy when one or more nodes fail or leave the system. However, file updates, the most frequent operations performed on files, pose challenges in maintaining coded information in the system up to date. In other words, any change in the file will impact all coded blocks in the system, so all traces of the file must be completely replaced. This becomes costly since recomputing coded blocks is very CPU intensive and replacing all the coded blocks consumes an excessive amount of bandwidth. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no work addressing this update problem. To this end, we propose a Differential Update Model (DUM) that will update coded blocks by delivering only the changes in the file. We also present our objective view of the model through a complete analysis on computational complexity and bandwidth saving and simulated experiments.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4539-2; POD:978-1-4673-4537-8","10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483349","","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Encoding;Maintenance engineering;Network coding;Redundancy;Vectors","cloud computing;distributed processing;file organisation;information retrieval systems;information storage;media streaming;multimedia computing;network coding;peer-to-peer computing","Dropbox;bandwidth saving;cloud service;cloud storage system;coded blocks;computational complexity;differential update model;distributed system;file updates;iCloud;multimedia streaming;network coding;peer to peer file sharing;storage service","","2","","32","","","1-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current study has two objectives, first, to conduct a multidimensional analysis of central and physical components of fatigue in drivers during simulated driving session and second, to find the rationality of each assessed parameter to be used for scoring system. Briefly, 12 skilled drivers were subjected to simulated driving session for 32-hours. An EEG and an ECG were obtained from each subject at 3-hours interval to assess central and peripheral components of driver's fatigue respectively. EEG data were analyzed to obtain the variation in relative energy of all frequency bands while ECG data were used to study heart rate variability(HRV) at progressive stages of fatigue. Concurrently, blood samples of each subject were analyzed for key blood biomarkers(random blood sugar, blood urea and creatinine) at 8-hours interval. The relative-energy of θ, α and β-bands increased most significantly at Cz electrode while the variations across the stages was most significant in a derived band i.e. α+θ / δ1-δ2 followed by that of θ-band. The power distribution in high frequency components of ECG showed a distinct decreasing trend with advancing fatigue. All blood biomarkers increased with duration of driving task that was significant across the stages. Thus, an effective scoring of drivers' fatigue can be obtained by integrating EEG parameters with HRV and blood biomarkers that can validate fatigue detecting devices under development.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4369-5; POD:978-1-4673-4367-1","10.1109/IHCI.2012.6481812","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6481812","Blood biomarkers;Driver's fatigue;ECG;EEG;HRV","Biomarkers;Blood;Electrocardiography;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Fatigue;Heart rate variability","blood;driver information systems;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;information retrieval;medical signal processing;road safety","ECG;EEG;biomedical approach;blood biomarkers;blood urea;creatinine;driver fatigue;heart rate variability;information retrieval;random blood sugar;road traffic accident prevention;simulated driving session","","2","","16","","","27-29 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Discovering this kind of causal relationships can help us prevent or correct negative outcomes caused by their antecedents. In this paper, we propose an innovative data mining framework and apply it to mine potential causal associations in electronic patient data sets where the drug-related events of interest occur infrequently. Specifically, we created a novel interestingness measure, exclusive causal-leverage, based on a computational, fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we previously developed. On the basis of this new measure, a data mining algorithm was developed to mine the causal relationship between drugs and their associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The algorithm was tested on real patient data retrieved from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit, Michigan. The retrieved data included 16,206 patients (15,605 male, 601 female). The exclusive causal-leverage was employed to rank the potential causal associations between each of the three selected drugs (i.e., enalapril, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) and 3,954 recorded symptoms, each of which corresponded to a potential ADR. The top 10 drug-symptom pairs for each drug were evaluated by the physicians on our project team. The numbers of symptoms considered as likely real ADRs for enalapril, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin were 8, 7, and 6, respectively. These preliminary results indicate the usefulness of our method in finding potential ADR signal pairs for further analysis (e.g., epidemiology study) and investigation (e.g., case review) by drug safety professionals.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2012.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152107","Adverse drug reactions;association rules;data mining algorithms;interestingness measure;recognition primed decision model","Computational modeling;Data mining;Databases;Drugs;Hidden Markov models;Marine vehicles","data mining;drugs;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;medical information systems","ADR;Veterans Affairs Medical Center;adverse drug reaction;adverse drug reaction signal;causal relationship discovery;computational model;drug related event;drug safety;electronic patient data set;exclusive causal leverage;fuzzy RPD model;infrequent causal association mining;innovative data mining;patient data retrieval;potential causal association rank;recognition primed decision model;symptoms","","11","","54","","20120214","April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper compares the two different search approaches for conducting literature review studies. The comparison is conducted by searching for articles addressing “Agile practices in global software engineering”. The focus of the paper is on evaluating the two different search approaches. Despite the differences in the included papers, the conclusions and the patterns found in both studies are quite similar. The strengths and weaknesses of each first step are discussed separately and in comparison with each other.

Discovery browsing is a type of information seeking behavior where the expert user interacts iteratively with a literature-based discovery system to explore poorly understood relationships with the end goal of formulating a hypothesis or gaining insight by uncovering novel points of view. The mathematical model underlying the IFT is predictive of information seeking behavior of foragers on the World Wide Web (WWW) in a plethora of scenarios. We hypothesize that a discovery browsing system based upon the IFT can assist the user in the process of discovery by automatically making available the concepts to which the user would most likely attend. Given initial terms from a user, the discovery browsing system mines a semantic network of over 26 million object-relation-object pairs from 7.8 million MEDLINE citations and presents a ranked sub-graph, which is the prediction of where the interesting concepts (ideally discoveries) lie. In this work, we present the theoretical foundations and design of the discovery browsing system.

"SALMA: Standard Arabic Language Morphological Analysis","M. Sawalha; E. Atwell; M. A. M. Abushariah","Computer Information Systems Department, King Abdullah II School of Information Technology, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan","2013 1st International Conference on Communications, Signal Processing, and their Applications (ICCSPA)","20130328","2013","","","1","6","Morphological analyzers are preprocessors for text analysis. Many Text Analytics applications need them to perform their tasks. This paper reviews the SALMA-Tools (Standard Arabic Language Morphological Analysis) [1]. The SALMA-Tools is a collection of open-source standards, tools and resources that widen the scope of Arabic word structure analysis - particularly morphological analysis, to process Arabic text corpora of different domains, formats and genres, of both vowelized and non-vowelized text. Tag-assignment is significantly more complex for Arabic than for many languages. The morphological analyzer should add the appropriate linguistic information to each part or morpheme of the word (proclitic, prefix, stem, suffix and enclitic); in effect, instead of a tag for a word, we need a subtag for each part. Very fine-grained distinctions may cause problems for automatic morphosyntactic analysis - particularly probabilistic taggers which require training data, if some words can change grammatical tag depending on function and context; on the other hand, fine-grained distinctions may actually help to disambiguate other words in the local context. The SALMA - Tagger is a fine grained morphological analyzer which is mainly depends on linguistic information extracted from traditional Arabic grammar books and prior-knowledge broad-coverage lexical resources; the SALMA - ABCLexicon. More fine-grained tag sets may be more appropriate for some tasks. The SALMA - Tag Set is a standard tag set for encoding, which captures long-established traditional fine-grained morphological features of Arabic, in a notation format intended to be compact yet transparent.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-2819-7; Electronic:978-1-4673-2821-0; POD:978-1-4673-2820-3","10.1109/ICCSPA.2013.6487311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487311","Fine-grain;Morphological analysis;Tag Set;Traditional Arabic Grammar;Traditional Arabic Lexicons","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Educational institutions;Gold;Morphology;Standards","information retrieval;linguistics;natural language processing;public domain software;text analysis","ABCLexicon;Arabic text corpora;Arabic word structure analysis;SALMA-TagSet;SALMA-Tagger;SALMA-tools;automatic morphosyntactic analysis;fine grained morphological analyzer;fine-grained tag sets;grammatical tag;linguistic information;linguistic information extraction;nonvowelized text;open source standards;prior-knowledge broad-coverage lexical resources;probabilistic taggers;standard Arabic language morphological analysis;tag-assignment;text analysis;text analytics applications;traditional Arabic grammar books;vowelized text;word morpheme","","2","","38","","","12-14 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We solved the problem by a novel principle using a microlens array. The marker displays a changing two-dimensional moiré pattern according to the visual-line direction. We can extract pose information from the pattern by image processing. The developed marker and the processing algorithm enable high-accuracy pose estimation even by observation from frontal direction. We verified its superiority to the conventional method by some validation tests.","1051-4651;10514651","Electronic:978-4-9906441-0-9; POD:978-1-4673-2216-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6460264","","Accuracy;Arrays;Estimation;Image processing;Lenses;Microoptics;Visualization","augmented reality;information retrieval;microlenses;pose estimation","2D Moire pattern;frontal direction;image processing;microlens array;planar visual marker;pose estimation;pose information extraction;visual line direction","","0","","3","","","11-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
