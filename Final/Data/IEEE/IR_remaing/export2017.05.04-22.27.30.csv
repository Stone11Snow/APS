"A hybrid approach to extract scene text from videos","A. Thilagavathy; K. Aarthi; A.

Hauling the scene text from image and video is challenging due to complex background, changeable font size, dissimilar style, unknown layout, poor resolution and blurring, position, viewing angle and so on. The primary objective of the proposed system is to detect and haul out the text from digital videos. Through this paper we propose a hybrid approach to haul out the text from videos by integration of the two popular text extraction methods: region and connected component (CC) based method. Primarily fragment the videos into frames and acquire the key frames. Text region indicator (TRI) is being developed to figure out the text prevailing confidence and candidate region by performing binarization. Artificial Neural network (ANN) is used as the classifier to filter out the text and non-text components where Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used for verification. Text is grouped by constructing the minimum spanning tree using the bounding box (BB) distance.","","DVD:978-1-4673-0210-4; Electronic:978-1-4673-0212-8; POD:978-1-4673-0211-1","10.1109/ICCEET.2012.6203930","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6203930","Caption text;Preprocessing;Scene text;Text extraction;Text grouping;Video frame extraction","Biomedical imaging;Detectors;Image recognition;Image segmentation;Optical character recognition software;Videos","indexing;information retrieval;neural nets;optical character recognition;text detection;video signal processing","ANN;BB distance;OCR;TRI;artificial neural network;bounding box distance;connected component;information indexing;information retrieval;optical character recognition;scene text extraction;text region indicator;videos","","4","","19","","","21-22 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a method based on question focus, which combines advantages of both rule based methods and statistical methods. The question focus is the kernel of a question and represents the form and content of the doubt. Firstly, question focus definition is given according to linguistics and extraction method is described based on dependency analysis and semantic role labeling on which both depends statistical machine learning. And then, classifying questions with same focus to one category, finer question taxonomy without unreliable human effects is introduced with support of domain ontology. In order to evaluate contributions of question focus, a classifier using question focus is designed and implemented in a practical QA system in restricted domain of computer hardware. Experimental result shows efficiency of question focus and contributions to improve accuracy of question classification and the overall performance of QA.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4692-6; POD:978-1-4673-1538-8","10.1109/CSNT.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200705","component;dependency analysis;ontology;question classification;question focus;semantic role","Accuracy;Computer crashes;Computers;Labeling;Ontologies;Semantics;Taxonomy","classification;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);question answering (information retrieval)","QA system;dependency analysis;domain ontology;question answer system;question classification;question focus;question taxonomy;rule based methods;semantic role labeling;statistical machine learning;statistical methods","","0","","12","","","11-13 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A multidimensional database serves the need of decision making on the basis of a knowledge discovery. This research work presents an integrated approach of knowledge discovery process and Multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP) tool. The initial step is creating a framework of computation models that formulate hybridized perceptron with fuzzification for multidimensional database management system (MDBMS) to produce crisp dataset to MOLAP. The data retrieved from multidimensional database (MDBMS), upon a structured query to MOLAP, explores the relational model for knowledge discovery process. The information retrieved thus represents a data cube for decision making. The experimental results of the proposed model have proven results for both supervised and unsupervised learning network. The approach has been adopted to serve the need of business logics and business intelligence in various knowledge discovery and hence to create an effective decision making system.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1601-9; POD:978-1-4673-1599-9","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206745","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206745","","Business;Data mining;Data models;Data warehouses;Distributed databases;Neurons","data mining;database management systems;decision making;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","MDBMS;MOLAP;business intelligence;business logics;data cube representation;data retrieval;decision making process;error tolerance;hybridized perceptron;integrated framework;knowledge discovery;multidimensional OLAP;multidimensional database management system;neurofuzzy inference system;structured query;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","","0","","5","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Boeing AATM has been receiving live Aircraft Situation Display to Industry (ASDI) data and archiving it for over two years. At the present time, there is not an easy mechanism to perform analytics on the data. The incoming data is large, compressed, and requires correlation with other flight data before it can be analyzed. The service exposes this data once it has been uncompressed, correlated, and stored in a database for further analysis using a variety of descriptive, predictive, and possibly prescriptive analytics tools. The service is being built partially in response to requests from Boeing Commercial Aviation for analysis of capacity and flow in the US National Airspace System. The service utilizes IBM Warehouse with DB2, WebSphere Message Broker, XML Shredding, and will be used with IBM analytics products.

In our previous work, we discovered that it is almost impossible to detect mimicking attacks from statistics if the number of active bots of a botnet is sufficient (no less than the number of active legitimate users). In this paper, we pointed out that it is usually hard for botnet owners to have sufficient number of active bots in practice.

However, typical screen readers process only one channel of audio and, therefore, convey the information from the web page in single-track, linearized format, stripping from it the two-dimensional spatial information available to sighted users of the same web page. There is an interest in presenting the sound from screen readers in multiple “virtual auditory columns,” aiming to restore the perception of two-dimensional placement of items on contemporary web pages. In this paper, we explore alternative methods to spatialize sound over five horizontal positions, in front of a computer user. An experimental comparison of two of these sound spatialization methods was statistically evaluated.

However, as sensitive cloud data may have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which obsoletes the traditional data utilization service based on plaintext keyword search, how to enable privacy-assured utilization mechanisms for outsourced cloud data is thus of paramount importance. Considering the large number of on-demand data users and huge amount of outsourced data files in cloud, the problem is particularly challenging, as it is extremely difficult to meet also the practical requirements of performance, system usability, and high-level user searching experiences. In this paper, we investigate the problem of secure and efficient similarity search over outsourced cloud data. Similarity search is a fundamental and powerful tool widely used in plaintext information retrieval, but has not been quite explored in the encrypted data domain. Our mechanism design first exploits a suppressing technique to build storage-efficient similarity keyword set from a given document collection, with edit distance as the similarity metric. Based on that, we then build a private trie-traverse searching index, and show it correctly achieves the defined similarity search functionality with constant search time complexity. We formally prove the privacy-preserving guarantee of the proposed mechanism under rigorous security treatment. To demonstrate the generality of our mechanism and further enrich the application spectrum, we also show our new construction naturally supports fuzzy search, a previously studied notion aiming only to tolerate typos and representation inconsistencies in the user searching input. The extensive experiments on Amazon cloud platform with real data set further demonstrate the validity and practicality of the p- oposed mechanism.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4673-0775-8; POD:978-1-4673-0773-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195784","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195784","","Encryption;Indexes;Keyword search;Servers;Usability","cloud computing;computational complexity;cryptography;data privacy;document handling;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval","Amazon cloud platform;cloud data outsourcing;data management systems;data utilization service;document collection;edit distance;encryption;fuzzy search;plaintext information retrieval;plaintext keyword search;privacy-assured similarity search;privacy-assured utilization mechanisms;private trie-traverse searching index;sensitive cloud data;similarity metric;similarity search usability;storage-efficient similarity keyword set;suppressing technique;time complexity","","54","2","23","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to address this problem, this paper analyzes how security requirements of each paper could be different by comparing with two schemes: Agrawal et al.'s scheme OPES (Order Preserving Encryption Scheme) and Zdonik et al.'s FCE (Fast Comparison Encryption) Zdonik et al. have formally disproved the security of Agrawal et al.'s scheme OPES. Thereafter, some scholars have wondered whether the OPES can guarantee its applicability in a real world for its insecurity or not. However, the analysis by Zdonik et al. does not have valid objectivity because they used the security model INFO-CPA-DB for their scheme FCE to analyze Agrawal et al.'s scheme OPES, in spite of the differences between two schemes. In order to analyze any scheme correctly and apply it to a real world properly, the analysis tool should be comprehensively standardized. We re-analyze Zdonik et al.'s analysis for OPES and then propose general formalizations of security and privacy for all of the encrypted retrieval systems. Finally, we recommend the minimum level of security requirements under our formal definitions. Additional considerations should be also supplemented in accordance with the conditions of each system.","","Electronic:978-89-88678-53-4; POD:978-1-4577-0471-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6222138","","Access control;Authentication;Databases;Encryption;Servers","cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;information retrieval","FCE;INFO-CPA-DB security model;OPES;attack protection;encrypted database;encrypted retrieval system;fast comparison encryption;insecurity;order preserving encryption scheme;privacy;security requirement;threat protection","","0","","21","","","Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Networking allows for easy monitoring of critical data of each motor or load connected to the intelligent motor control center, enabling precise process control at all times. With this information, plant staff can respond to potential problems proactively. Real-time access to information and records of last faults allow for simplified diagnostics and reduced downtime. However, the intelligent motor control center concept isn't a new approach.

The crawler is an important module of a web search engine. The quality of a crawler directly affects the searching quality of such web search engines. Such a web crawler may interact with millions of hosts over a period of weeks or months, and thus issues of robustness, flexibility, and manageability are of major importance. Given some URLs, the crawler should retrieve the web pages of those URLs, parse the HTML files, add new URLs into its queue and go back to the first phase of this cycle. The crawler also can retrieve some other information from the HTML files as it is parsing them to get the new URLs. This paper proposes a framework and algorithm, TOPCRAWL for mining. The proposed TOPCRAWL algorithm is a new crawling method which emphasis on topic relevancy and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with respect to recall values achievable within a given period of time.

Although these descriptions intuitively have less discriminatory capability than traditional biometric approaches, they are able to retrieve and recognize subjects based solely on a human description. To permit soft biometric identification the human description must be accurate, yet conventional human descriptions comprising of absolute labels and estimations are often unreliable. In this paper we introduce a novel method of human description which utilizes comparative descriptors derived from visual comparisons between subjects. This innovative approach to obtaining human descriptions has been shown to counter many problems associated with absolute categorical labels. Comparative categorical labels are objective and can be used to infer descriptive continuous relative measurements. The resulting biometric signatures have been demonstrated to differ significantly from absolute descriptions allowing improved retrieval of subjects and could even be used to increase the accuracy of witness description in crime analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-84919-565-2","10.1049/ic.2011.0111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6203662","","","biometrics (access control);digital signatures;information retrieval;object detection","biometric signatures;crime analysis;human description;human identification;soft biometric identification;subjects retrieval;witness description","","0","","","","","3-4 Nov. 2011","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

In order to effectively utilize a composite service, the users require a convenient user friendly interface to invoke services which is natural language interface.

To accomplish this task, the IC uses a couple of radio channels for communicating with the Alarms Center (AC, also known as Emergency Operation Center) and the resources assigned to such emergency. Although radio-based communication has brought several benefits, it also has drawbacks for sending, sharing, updating, and saving geospatial information. This paper presents the extension to a mobile collaborative tool called “MobileMap”, which complements the radio system. The tool helps to increase the availability of the most frequently requested information for the IC and firefighters in the field. The system design was based on a study of relevant information that the IC requires on-site for an efficient and effective decision-making. The results highlight that using MobileMap makes it possible to reduce the radio channels usage time by approximately 20%. Furthermore, the information shared through the application improves the IC decision-making process during an emergency.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1212-7; POD:978-1-4673-1211-0","10.1109/CSCWD.2012.6221843","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6221843","Mobile collaborative application;communication support;information availability;urban emergencies","Companies;Fires;Mobile communication;Radio frequency;Simple object access protocol;Tsunami;XML","alarm systems;decision making;emergency services;fires;geographic information systems;groupware;information management;information retrieval;mobile computing;telecommunication traffic;wireless channels","MobileMap;alarms center;decision making;emergency operation center;firefighter incident commander;geospatial information saving;geospatial information sharing;mobile collaborative application;mobile collaborative tool;radio channels;radio traffic reduction;radio-based communication;urban emergencies","","1","","23","","","23-25 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web Services technologies responded quickly to help such evolution and in many situations the Web Services application is driving businesses and dictating a new way of doing business. In this paper, we present an ideal model for developing web servers for small organizations by including search engine optimization techniques such as the best set of keywords from the search results of the Top-k Keyword Proximity Organic Searches and from the results of Similar Keyword Searches and Image Searches. We analyze the database of the web services to discover the customers' preferences, demographics, and demand patterns and trends. Also, we discuss the Quality of Services (QoS) of the Web services including the areas of Trust and Reputation, Security, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), and the Reliability and Performance. Our prototypes and studies could be applied to improve the global Search Marketing (SM) of enterprise websites in small organizations in areas of business, health, government, education, library and many others. Furthermore, we address the future trends of the Web Server developments as the Internet of Things (IOT) or Machine to Machine (M2M) in contrast with the existing Internet for the connection of people.

To substantiate our position, we present a refinement of a recent QIF metric that appears in the literature. Our refinement is based on slight changes we bring into the design of that metric. These changes do not affect the theoretical premises onto which the original metric is laid. However, they enable the natural association between flow results and the exhaustive search effort needed to uncover a program's secret information (or the residual secret part of that information) to be clearly established.

This has resulted in the need to develop automatic methods for retrieving learning materials and ranking them corresponding to their significance to the specified query yet again from the e-learning perspective. Ranking of documents is known to be an essential process in information retrieval (IR) where retrieved documents are projected in the order of their expected level of significance to the query. Conventional document ranking methods are depends upon the essential measurements of similarity between documents and query. However from the e-learning viewpoint, the significance to the query is depends upon the relevancy of the document to the topic of the query and hence retrieval needs to be based on the query, an essence of the topic related to the query and the documents themselves. This work presents a topic profile based query expansion and re-ranking system that aims at retrieving and ranking documents from the web that would be suitable to extract learning material for an e-learning scenario. Topic profile contains chapters, topics and annotation terms represented as a hierarchical representation of keywords for a particular topic. This topic profile is designed for a particular course (subject), incorporating details from more than one curriculum and is a representation of the topic from a learning viewpoint. The topic profile is used for two purposes; one to generate queries to discover documents missed out from the topic profile and second to re-rank documents based on topic profile. Thus the topic profile is used for organizing learning materials from search engines to maximize topic coverage and minimize redundancy among retrieved results.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1601-9; POD:978-1-4673-1599-9","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206770","Elearning;Re-ranking;topic learning terms;topic profile","Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Google;Materials;Search engines;Web search","computer aided instruction;document handling;information retrieval","IR;automatic methods;discovering content;document discovery;document ranking methods;document retreival;e-learning content;e-learning perspective;educational material reranking;information retrieval;learning material retreival;query expansion;rerank documents;topic profile","","0","","11","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Term Discrimination Values (TDVs) are better measures compared to frequency or term weights to select the keywords. Terms with high TDVs will generate good keywords. Hamdouchi, P. Willet and Carolyn J Crouch have developed various algorithms to generate TDVs. In earlier days frequency or weighted frequency was used to compute TDVs. But these simple or weighted frequencies are not enough for retrieving relevant documents. Here we use some new features, connected with the distribution of terms within the document, called distributional features, to compute the TDVs. Distributional features such as First Appearance, Last Appearance, Compactness on number of parts, distance between first and last occurrence and on variance of positions of term occurrences etc. are pointers to the importance of the term in a document.

Through this work we also could prove that it is correct in the case of generating keywords. An additional overhead in storage and time is compensated by this efficient output.

Information technology plays a major role in the future of education, as they break geographical barriers and make educational content widely available. Knowledge collaboration is possible by creating virtual classrooms by interconnecting lecturers to geographically scattered students. Making educational material, such as tutorials and recorded lectures, available worldwide through high-storage infrastructures. Digitalizing and making books available through high-storage infrastructures. But this E-learning system requires huge investment for high-storage infrastructure. Some educational organizations and research institutes cannot afford expensive investments. On the other hand, in most of the organizations, there are large amounts of underutilized computing power and storage existing. Data Grid connects underutilized secondary storage of machines and provides huge secondary storage. It enables resource sharing among the geographically distributed users and resources. Therefore the institutes which do not have sufficient budget can make use of Data Grid efficiently. In this paper we have presented that how Grid computing can be used for inexpensive collaborative E-learning. Data replication increases availability, reliability of data and allows fast access to data. Replication reduces bandwidth consumption and congestion over communication line. Therefore replication is the major issue in Data Grid. Replication strategies determine when and where to create a replica of the data. A good replication strategy should ideally minimize file access time, reduce network congestion and minimize job execution time to improve performance of Data Grid. We strongly believe that the technological revolution that the grid is about to bring will definitely change the way that people dea- with information and, ultimately, knowledge.

Indeed, today's mobile devices often support multiple communication technologies for accessing Internet services. For users the accessing of these data hungry services means that the mobile device has to be charged more often. Energy efficiency in mobile device communication has been considered to be out of users hands. The concept of Always Best Connected (ABC) allows a person to connect applications using the devices and access technologies that best suit to his or her needs, thereby combining the features of access technologies to provide an enhanced user experience for future Internet. This Always Best Connected scenario can make mobile device more energy efficient by using always the most energy efficient connection. Mobile communication networks and connected devices consume a small fraction of the global energy supply. However, meeting the rapidly increasing demand for more capacity in wireless broadband access will further increase the energy consumption. For example Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast 2010-2015 expects compound annual growth rate of 92 percent during 2010 to 2015 Operators are now facing both investing in denser and denser networks as well as increased energy cost. Current cellular systems based on Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and Long Term Evolution (LTE) is characterized by high spectrum efficiency, but low energy efficiency. In urban areas as well as in homes and offices alongside cellular networks IEEE 802.11 (WLAN in this papers context) networks are available. In this heterogeneous network environment the communication energy efficiency can make significant difference when considering how often the user has to recharge the mobile device. In this article we analyze energy efficiency of Always-Best-Connected solution. The appli- ation is used in measurements in a various real-life use-cases. The results are showing that algorithm can improve overall energy efficiency without compromising the user experience.","2157-4952;21574952","Electronic:978-1-4673-0229-6; POD:978-1-4673-0228-9; USB:978-1-4673-0227-2","10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208701","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208701","","3G mobile communication;Current measurement;IP networks;Mobile handsets;Power demand;Wireless LAN","3G mobile communication;Internet;Long Term Evolution;broadband networks;cellular radio;energy conservation;information retrieval;mobile handsets;mobility management (mobile radio);power consumption;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;LTE;UMTS;access technology;always best connected;cellular network;data access;data hungry service;energy consumption;energy efficiency;long term evolution;mobile Internet;mobile device communication;power consumption;spectrum efficiency;universal mobile telecommunications system;user equipment;wireless broadband access","","4","","9","","","7-10 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Srivastava","Department of Foundations of Education, Faculty of Education, Dayalbagh Educational Institute, Dayalbagh, Agra, India","2012 IEEE International Conference on Technology Enhanced Education (ICTEE)","20120531","2012","","","1","5","In present scenario we are facing a time of information evolution, in the ever changing world our teachers and students requires the right information from the right sources today. The present world is changing rapidly and the field of education is experiencing these changes in particular as it applies to Media Services. The old days of an educational institution having an isolated audio-visual department are long gone! The growth in use of multimedia within the education sector has accelerated in recent years, and looks set for continued expansion in the future. Teachers primarily require access to learning resources, which can support concept development by learners in a variety of ways to meet individual learning needs. The development of multimedia technologies for learning offers new ways in which learning can take place in schools and the home. Enabling teachers to have access to multimedia learning resources, which support constructive concept development, allows the teacher to focus more on being a facilitator of learning while working with individual students. Extending the use of multimedia learning resources to the home represents an educational opportunity with the potential to improve student learning. The elements used in multimedia have all existed before. Multimedia simply combines these elements into a powerful new tool, especially in the hands of teachers and students. Interactive multimedia weaves five basic types of media into the learning environment: text, video, sound, graphics and animation. Since the mode of learning is interactive and not linear, a student or teacher can choose what to investigate next. For example, one does not start on the first page of a linear document and read to the end. Interactive multimedia learning mode is more like constructing a spider's web, with one idea linked to another, allowing choices in the learner's path. The multimedia technologies that have had the greatest impact in education are those that augmen- the existing curriculum, allowing both immediate enhancement and encouraging further curriculum development. For example, the WWW serves as a storehouse of information that individual learners can search for subject matter content that specifically fits their learning agendas. In the context of the present study, the concept of smart classrooms does not completely do away with the traditional method of teaching. Rather it seeks to club the use of technology with conventional methods of teaching. The resultant product is a harmonious blend of the modern and the traditional. For instance, the teacher while teaching a lesson on volcanoes will supplement the information given in books by showing a video of how a volcano erupts. Educomp smart class is one of the applications of the ICT. Educomp smart class is transforming the way teachers teach and students learn. Educomp smart class is a digital initiative pioneered and invented by Educomp. Smart class provides a very systematic way of learning through curriculum and well equipped computer classes. Educomp smart class also provides a large repository of 3D animated modules and videos mapped to school curriculum. Frame by frame, with engaging and instructionally sound animated set of visuals while retaining complete control on the pace of delivery. The curriculum reach unfolds from kindergarten to grade twelve covering subjects like Mathematics, Science, English, EVS, Social Studies, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, Economics and Business Studies. The Educomp Smart Class programme has an overall positive impact on students more in terms of generating curiosity and grasping complex concepts rather than capturing attention, while it helps teachers in managing time.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0726-1; POD:978-1-4577-0725-4","10.1109/ICTEE.2012.6208606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208606","Digital Initiative;Educomp Smart Class;ICT;Multimedia Technology;Teacher as a facilitator","Computers;Educational institutions;Media;Multimedia communication;Streaming media","audio-visual systems;computer animation;courseware;educational institutions;information retrieval;interactive video;multimedia systems;psychology;teaching","3D animated modules;EVS education;Educomp Smart Class programme;Educomp smart class;English;ICT;WWW;animation;audio-visual department;biology education;business studies;chemistry education;concept development;curriculum development;economics education;education sector;educational institution;geography education;graphics media;history education;individual learning needs;information storage;interactive multimedia learning mode;mathematics education;media services;multimedia learning resource access;multimedia technologies;physics education;school curriculum;science education;smart classrooms;social studies;sound media;student attitude;teaching method;text media;video media","","1","","12","","","3-5 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multilevel hash table scheme we propose gets a good consequence in the case where we spend a little more resource but much less total numbers of access than traditional schemes.","","DVD:978-1-4577-1413-9; Electronic:978-1-4577-1415-3; POD:978-1-4577-1414-6","10.1109/CECNet.2012.6201540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6201540","bloom structure;calculable;high speed access;multiple-hash","Computer aided manufacturing;Data processing;Filtering algorithms;Hardware;High-speed networks;Table lookup;Writing","cryptography;information retrieval;resource allocation","bloom structure;d-left;d-random;flow store;hash table scheme;high speed access;multiple-choice hashing","","0","","6","","","21-23 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a framework which allows for an efficient video archive forensic search and data exploration in an interactive manner, and exploiting hardware accelerated video analytics at the same time. Furthermore we present a query concept to facilitate and improve the search for a specific person in large video surveillance archives using a synthetic human model in a query-by-example manner.

Vehicles may not find suitable resources because sharing information could quickly become obsolete or irrelevant resources. This paper proposes an efficient geo-aware Peer-to-Peer (P2P) search mechanism to enable resource discovery and sharing in VANETs. We propose discovery and sharing schemes based on the virtual backbone architecture, and then limit the data exchanging region to reduce unnecessary message transmissions. Because the resource node changes very fast, the coordinator must be set to maintain the local node of geographic information in the network. In this scheme, coordinators are established to store information and manage local resource information. In order to ensure dissemination performance, it must guarantee that vehicles possess enough resource pieces to allow efficient bartering. Furthermore, three kinds of piece selection mechanisms, including Nearest-First, Rarest-First, and In-Order are proposed to download resource pieces from other vehicles and to improve the dissemination efficiency. Experiment results demonstrate that our searching and sharing schemes are efficient and outperforms other schemes in terms of satisfactory ratio and download time.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4654-4; POD:978-1-4673-0798-7","10.1109/ITNG.2012.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209124","Vehicular ad-hoc networks;peer-to-peer;piece selection policy;resource discovery and sharing","Ad hoc networks;Availability;Mobile communication;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Servers;Vehicles","geographic information systems;information dissemination;information management;information retrieval;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation;telecommunication network topology;traffic information systems;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET topology;data exchanging region;downloading time;geo-aware peer-to-peer search mechanism;geographic information;in-order piece selection mechanism;information sharing;message transmission;nearest-first piece selection mechanism;rarest-first piece selection mechanism;resource discovery;resource node;resource pieces downloading;resource sharing scheme;vehicular ad-hoc networks","","0","","16","","","16-18 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to further improve the effect of the semantic block segmentation, combining DOM structure and tree edit distance, the optimization algorithm of the semantic block is given.

This paper analyses the concept of provenance and discusses how the establishment of personalized provenance recording and retrieval systems can be used to increase the utility of data and engender user trust in complex service-based systems. An overview of current provenance research is presented, and a real-world project to address the abstract concepts of trust and data quality in industrial and clinical settings is presented.

However, the capacity of those high speed links is still much less than the aggregate bandwidth of all compute nodes. In Data Parallel Systems such as GFS/MapReduce, clusters are built with commodity hardware and each node takes the roles of both computation and storage, which makes it possible to bring compute to data. Data locality is a significant advantage of data parallel systems over traditional HPC systems. Good data locality reduces cross-switch network traffic - one of the bottlenecks in data-intensive computing. In this paper, we investigate data locality in depth. Firstly, we build a mathematical model of scheduling in MapReduce and theoretically analyze the impact on data locality of configuration factors, such as the numbers of nodes and tasks. Secondly, we find the default Hadoop scheduling is non-optimal and propose an algorithm that schedules multiple tasks simultaneously rather than one by one to give optimal data locality. Thirdly, we run extensive experiments to quantify performance improvement of our proposed algorithms, measure how different factors impact data locality, and investigate how data locality influences job execution time in both single-cluster and cross-cluster environments.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4691-9; POD:978-1-4673-1395-7","10.1109/CCGrid.2012.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6217449","Hadoop;MapReduce;data locality;scheduling","Computer architecture;Data models;Optimal scheduling;Schedules;Scheduling;Scheduling algorithms","data handling;information retrieval;parallel processing;processor scheduling;storage management","cross-cluster environments;cross-switch network traffic;data access requirements;data intensive computing;data locality;data parallel systems;default Hadoop scheduling;job execution time;mathematical model;multiuser environments;performance improvement;single cluster environments","","31","3","19","","","13-16 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike the Bag-of-Words (BoW hereafter) approach in most existing work of the problem, our method uses direct feature matching to detect loop closures and therefore avoid the perceptual aliasing problem caused by the vector quantization process of BoW. We show that a tree structure can be efficient in online loop closure detection. In our method, a KD-tree is built over all the key frame features and an indexing table is kept for retrieving relevant key frames. Due to the efficiency of the tree-based feature matching, loop closure detection can be achieved in real-time. To investigate the scalability of the method, we also apply the scale dependent feature selection in our method and show that the run time can be reduced significantly at the expense of sacrificing the performance to some extent. The proposed method is validated on an indoor SLAM dataset with 7,420 images.","1050-4729;10504729","Electronic:978-1-4673-1405-3; POD:978-1-4673-1403-9; USB:978-1-4673-1404-6","10.1109/ICRA.2012.6224741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224741","","Feature extraction;Indexing;Real time systems;Scalability;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Visualization","SLAM (robots);feature extraction;image matching;indexing;information retrieval;mobile robots;object detection;robot vision;tree data structures","KD-tree;appearance-based robot SLAM;direct feature matching;feature selection;frame features;indexing table;indoor SLAM dataset;key frame retrieval;online loop closure detection;real-time loop closure detection;tree structure;tree-based feature matching;visual feature indexing;visual loop closure detection","","5","","18","","","14-18 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the time needed for channel switching can be ignored, a Maximum Matching optimal algorithm is exhibited for LNDR which requires only polynomial time; when the switching time cannot be neglected, LNDR is proven to be NP-hard and a greedy algorithm with constant approximation ratio is developed.

The effective and efficient management of large quantities of data is a common problem found in many industries. An effective Management Information System (MIS) supplies accurate, relevant and timely information to the manager of an organization. Decision making is an important requirement in every organization, where in different types of information obtained from different functional area of management like finance, marketing, production, personal, planning and control etc. This paper discusses the acceptance and usage of Management Information System in 50 organizations consisting of 30 small scale and 20 medium to large scale organizations. The study is exclusively based on the primary data collected through a sample survey. Main emphasis was laid to understand MIS usage and problems which hinder its use. To achieve the objective of the study, the data was collected through a structured and pretested questionnaire. The analysis reveals that only 5 out of 30 small scale organizations and as many as 16 out of 20 medium to large scale organizations are found making use of MIS for supporting decision making process. To find out the possible reasons for inadequate MIS usage in organization, the respondents were requested to provide a feedback on various factors which could be possible causes for non-use of MIS in their respective organizations. In order to increase the usage of MIS in small scale organizations, there is a need to build up computer culture by properly disseminating information about potential computer applications and the benefits thereof. Such information dissemination is required to be made through various seminars/conferences/training programs etc. This in turn, increases the usage of MIS in organizations.","","Electronic:978-81-909042-2-3; POD:978-1-4673-0213-5","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6216230","Acceptance;Information;Management;System;Usage","Industries;Information systems;Materials;Organizations;Planning;Seminars;USA Councils","business data processing;decision making;information dissemination;information retrieval;management information systems;small-to-medium enterprises","MIS acceptance;MIS usage;computer culture;data management;decision making;information dissemination;management information system;medium to large scale industries;relevant information;small scale industries","","0","","12","","","30-31 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to increase search efficiency further, peer groups were studied, and the concept of similar peer groups and a keywords based similarity measuring model between peer groups were proposed. In the model, similarity degrees of each document belonging two peers were first calculated according to the keywords in different peer groups, and then the similarity degree between the two peers was determined by similar documents and their similarity degrees. After that, the two peer groups' similarity degree relied on the amount of the similar pairs and their similarity degrees.

One major challenge in Web interface interpretation is to discover the semantic structure underlying a Web interface. Many heuristic approaches have been developed to discover and group semantically related interface objects. However, those approaches cannot solve the problem of nonuniformity satisfactorily and are not able to tag the semantic role of each object. Distinct from existing approaches, this paper develops a robust and formal approach to recovering interface semantics using graph grammars. Because of the distinct capability of spatial specifications in the abstract syntax, the spatial graph grammar (SGG) is selected to perform the semantic grouping and interpretation of segmented screen objects. Instead of analyzing HTML source codes, we apply an efficient image-processing technology to recognize atomic interface objects from the screenshot of an interface and produce a spatial graph, which records significant spatial relations among recognized objects. A spatial graph is more concise than its corresponding document object model structure and, thus, facilitates interface analysis and interpretation. Based on the spatial graph, the SGG parser recovers the hierarchical relations among interface objects.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2171335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6096442","Data extraction;graph grammar;image processing;page segmentation","Grammar;Graphical user interfaces;HTML;Image segmentation;Semantics;Visualization;Web pages","Internet;document image processing;graph grammars;information retrieval;user interfaces","HTML source codes;Internet;SGG;Web interface interpretation;abstract syntax;atomic interface objects;document object model structure;image-processing technology;segmented screen objects;semantic grouping;spatial graph grammar","","3","","49","","20111207","July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The semantic web brings with it the promise of a web of data (instead of the current web of documents) that will help to lower some of the barriers developers encounter when trying to gather data from multiple sources. Instead of having to resort to brittle screen-scrapping techniques, if data that is already present in web pages is encased in markup (such as RDFa) that makes it meaning explicit, developers can harvest that data directly and without ambiguities, turning human readable into machine readable data without the need to duplicate data. Since most of today's web development is done using web application frameworks that generate pages dynamically, placing that kind of markup unassisted is not feasible. As such there is the need for tools that extend the functionalities provided by web application frameworks in order to be able to add that kind of markup to a dynamically generated page, using the correct information for each item. In this paper we introduce one of those tools, aRDF, a plugin for the Grails web application framework that can be used to generate RDFa enhanced pages based on annotated underlying domain information.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-1012-3; POD:978-1-4503-1012-3","10.1145/2261605.2261622","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218057","Grails;Plugin;RDFa;Semantic Web","Databases;HTML;Layout;Resource description framework;Semantics;Standards;Vocabulary","information retrieval;open systems;semantic Web","Grails Web application framework;RDF-in-attributes;RDFa enhanced page generation;RDFa semantic information;Web of data;Web pages;Web resource;aRDF;data reusability;direct data harvesting;dynamically generated page;interoperability;machine readable data;semantic Web","","0","","26","","","23-25 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The atomic unit of any e-learning environment is a Learning object, a digital entity which can be used in electronic learning environment. These learning objects are stored in repositories and are managed by Learning Management Systems. However, the exponential availability of information leads to a difficult scenario like finding a particular educational resource for a learner, based on the context or based on his/her preferences. The searching through keywords or metadata will result in display of huge quantity of information. Thus there is an earnest need to identify the techniques that can provide more efficient mechanism for information retrieval. In this paper a model is being proposed that can enhance the search and delivery of a relevant learning object to a learner using quality metrics & clustering of learning objects through Self Organising Maps.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0734-5; POD:978-1-4673-0733-8","10.1109/DICTAP.2012.6215396","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215396","Clustering;K-mean;Learning Objects (LO);Quality Metrics;Recommender System;Self Organizing Map","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Electronic learning;Least squares approximation;Measurement;Search problems","information retrieval;pattern clustering","E-learning today;clustering technique;electronic learning environment;information retrieval;learning management system;learning object retrieving;particular educational resource;quality metrics;self organising maps","","5","","46","","","16-18 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Intelligent optimization models for disease diagnosis using a service-oriented architecture and management science","N. El-Bathy; C. Gloster; G. Azar; M. El-Bathy; G. Stein","North Carolina A&T State University","2012 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","20120621","2012","","","1","8","The accuracy of disease diagnosis remains a significant challenge that medical and health care industries experience due to a relative lack of misdiagnosis studies and a difficulty of retrieving patients' information. Validation of diagnosis and certainty of its accuracy is the goal of this research. The research, as reported in this paper introduces an innovative solution to determine the accuracy of disease diagnosis. The solution is based on Intelligent Optimization Models (IOM) using integration of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Management Science (MS). These models enable medical doctors to make inference about disease diagnosis and allow a quick diagnosis of diseases at higher level of accuracy. The models also have the advantage of reducing health risk associated with experimenting with real patients. In particular, bad decisions that cause death or wrong treatment can be avoided. About 44,000 to 98,000 Americans die annually as the result of medical errors. Experimenting with these models requires less time and is less expensive than experimenting with studying patient's condition. In a SOA environment, the study of this research develops new intelligent concepts. These concepts integrate approaches of management science models including linear programming and network, search methodologies, information retrieval, clustering extended genetic algorithm, and intelligent agents. A prototype is created and examined in order to validate the concepts. The proposed concepts strengthen the capacity and quality of STEM undergraduate degree programs. The concepts also promote a vigorous STEM academic environment to increase the number of students entering STEM careers.","2154-0357;21540357","Electronic:978-1-4673-0818-2; POD:978-1-4673-0819-9","10.1109/EIT.2012.6220716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6220716","Clustering Extended Genetic Algorithm;Disease Diagnosis;Management Science;SOA","Accuracy;Diseases;Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Service oriented architecture","diseases;genetic algorithms;health care;information retrieval;linear programming;management science;medical computing;multi-agent systems;patient diagnosis;pattern clustering;service-oriented architecture","IOM;MS;SOA;STEM academic environment;STEM undergraduate degree programs;clustering extended genetic algorithm;disease diagnosis;health care industries;health risk reduction;information retrieval;intelligent agents;intelligent optimization models;linear network;linear programming;management science;medical care industries;search methodologies;service-oriented architecture","","1","","22","","","6-8 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They usually appear on ecommerce websites or any online download market. If some products have a large number of reviews, customer may not have time to read all of them. Therefore, we need to extract software information characteristic from reviews in order to provide product review representation. Customer can further use it to compare one software product attributes and other products' attributes. Software product quality from user point of view may be used to characterize each software product. ISO 9126 is widely used among software engineer to assess software quality in use. It covers software quality model and contains the quality model characteristic from user perspective: effectiveness, productivity, safety and satisfaction. We propose a methodology for software product reviews mining based on software quality ontology constructed from ISO 9126 and a rule-based classification to finally produce software quality in use scores for software product Representation. The quality in use score for each software characteristic can be used to preliminary determine the quality of the software.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0734-5; POD:978-1-4673-0733-8","10.1109/DICTAP.2012.6215397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215397","ontology;opinion mining;rule-based classification;software quality","Data mining;ISO standards;Ontologies;Productivity;Safety;Software quality","Internet;customer satisfaction;data mining;decision making;electronic commerce;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;product quality;software quality;software reviews","ISO 9126;Web site;customer review mining;e-commerce;information characteristic extraction;information decision making;online download market;product review representation;rule-based classification;software engineer;software product acquisition;software product quality;software quality ontology;user effectiveness;user safety;user satisfaction","","5","","16","","","16-18 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
