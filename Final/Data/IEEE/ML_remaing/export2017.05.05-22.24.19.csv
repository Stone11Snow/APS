The framework is designed by considering the following facts: 1) a reference data with labeled samples are utilized, because no prior information is available about the image scene for anomaly detection and 2) pixel pairs are generated to enlarge the sample size, since the advantage of CNN can be realized only if the number of training samples is sufficient. A multilayer CNN is trained by using difference between pixel pairs generated from the reference image scene. Then, for each pixel in the image for anomaly detection, difference between pixel pairs, constructed by combining the center pixel and its surrounding pixels, is classified by the trained CNN with the result of similarity measurement. The detection output is simply generated by averaging these similarity scores. Experimental performance demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the classic Reed-Xiaoli and the state-of-the-art representation-based detectors, such as sparse representation-based detector (SRD) and collaborative representation-based detector.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2017.2657818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875485","Anomaly detection;convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;hyperspectral imagery","Detectors;Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Machine learning;Testing;Training","","","","","","","","20170310","May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, with the development of deep learning, many deep network based speaker recognition algorithms are proposed. However, the evaluations on the speaker recognition algorithms are always performed on a small or middle scale of voiceprint corpus. There are few evaluation reports of speaker recognition on a large scale of voiceprint corpus. In this paper, we try to introduce a deep nonlinear metric learning based speaker identification algorithm and construct a larger scale of voiceprint corpus consisting of about 440 thousand people. We perform the evaluation of the deep nonlinear metric learning based method on the large scale corpus and give the recognition rate results in different scales. The evaluation results prove that, the performance is surely decreased when the scale of the corpus is increased. But for the scale of 400 thousand, the recognition rate of Top 50 is stable at about 95%, which means that it could be used in some real applications.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4294-4; POD:978-1-5090-4295-1","10.1109/ISCSLP.2016.7918405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7918405","deep nonlinear metric learning;large scale of voiceprint corpus;speaker identification","Feature extraction;Machine learning;Measurement;Speaker recognition;Spectrogram;Speech recognition;Training","","","","","","","","","17-20 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A large number of reviews are difficult to evaluate personally. Moreover due to variable nature of reviews it becomes difficult, to compile overall result of reviews, to know which product is better than other. Researchers have already implemented machine learning techniques to analyze sentiment present in the given document. But execution time for these techniques increases due to the increase in feature set of data. Also irrelevant features participate in determining the sentiment of the given document, thereby varying the accuracy of the algorithm. In order to get much better classification, we propose a Biogeography based optimization algorithm to select optimal features set from given data.

Decomposing and reconstructing processes are performed using a 2-D DWT (2D-DWT) and inverse 2D-DWT respectively. The underlying relationships between radar, optical, and terrain data and wet areas are learned by training an SVM at the coarse resolution of the wet-area map.

In this work, a traditional dictionary based algorithm is adopted to analyze text sentiment of these comments. A deep learning method is proposed to analyze the network public sentiment of these comments due to the inherent defects of the traditional method itself. Firstly a convolutional neural network(CNN) model is constructed as sentiment classifier, Secondly the words are translated into a space vector with the aid of Word2Vec. Hence the sentences are converted into a two-dimensional matrix as input of the classifier. Finally the deep learning method and the dictionary method are compared and analyzed.

Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) has been successfully applied on local image patches to estimate image quality, However, existing patch-based IQA approaches require manual patch selection processes as well as possesses high computational complexity. To mitigate such issues, this paper introduces a very-deep no-reference image condition evaluator (VeNICE), which leverages the power of deep learning using very deep neural networks to model the complex relationship between visual content and the perceived quality in a more global manner compared to existing patched-based methods. VeNICE leverages a very deep convolutional neural network architecture with intrinsic image decomposition capabilities, and is trained to learn to assess image quality based on training samples consisting of different distortions and degradation such as blur, Gaussian noise, and compression artifacts.

However, sludge bulking remains a widespread problem in the operation of activated sludge processes, which leads to severe economic and environmental consequences. Sludge volume index (SVI) monitoring is a key challenge that will become even more crucial in the years ahead to quantify sludge bulking. This brief presents a system that consists of online sensors and an SVI predicting plant. The SVI predicting plant uses a hierarchical radial basis function (HRBF) neural network to predict SVI in a wastewater treatment process (WWTP). Then, an approach named extended extreme learning machine (EELM) is proposed for training the weights of HRBF. Unlike conventional single-hidden-layer feedforward networks, this EELM-HRBF is based on the hierarchical structure which is capable of hierarchical learning of sequential information online, and one may only need to adjust the output weights linking the hidden and the output layers. In such EELM-HRBF implementations, the EELM provides better generalization performance during the learning process. Moreover, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. To illustrate the methodology, the proposed predicting plant with the EELM-HRBF has been tested and compared with other methods by applying it to the problem of predicting SVI in a simplified and real WWTP. Experimental results show that the EELM-HRBF can be used to predict the wastewater quality online.

There exists a research trend for computerized analysis of suspicious skin lesions for malignancy using images captured by digital cameras. Analysis of these images is usually challenging due to existence of disturbing factors such as illumination variations and light reflections from skin surface. One important stage in diagnosis of melanoma is segmentation of lesion region from normal skin. In this paper, a method for accurate extraction of lesion region is proposed that is based on deep learning approaches. The input image, after being preprocessed to reduce noisy artifacts, is applied to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN combines local and global contextual information and outputs a label for each pixel, producing a segmentation mask that shows the lesion region. This mask will be further refined by some post processing operations. The experimental results show that our proposed method can outperform the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of segmentation accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4847-2; POD:978-1-5090-4848-9","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7899656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7899656","Melanoma;convolutional neural network;deep learning;medical image segmentation;skin cancer","Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Lesions;Lighting;Machine learning;Malignant tumors;Skin","","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is challenging because the aging variation is specific to a given individual and is determined by not only the person's gene, but also by many external factors, such as exposure, weather conditions (e.g. ambient humidity), health, gender, living style and living location. Age categorization is a multiclass problem. Lack of a good public aging dataset makes it difficult to estimate age from face image. Due to large multiclass nature of human ages, it is difficult to collect large aging database. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to collect high quality aging face images. Application Programming Interface (API) services provided by Microsoft Search Engine Bing are adopted for this purpose. Automatic collection of age-specified query images was implemented in C# programming interface with Microsoft BING API services. The experimental results of age estimation has verified that our approach is a good way to collect aging images in huge volume since internet hosts a large number of images with age labeling. It serves as an alternative cheap platform to gather face images for age classification.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0434-1; POD:978-1-4799-0432-7","10.1109/ICICS.2013.6782962","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6782962","BIF;Extreme learning machines;Facial age estimation;LGBP features;Web mining","Aging;Databases;Estimation;Face;Feature extraction;Internet;Search engines","Internet;application program interfaces;data mining;face recognition;image classification","C# programming interface;Internet;Microsoft BING API services;Web image mining;age categorization;age classification;age labeling;age-specified query images;aging variation;application programming interface;face image based age estimation;face image classification;large aging database collection;public aging dataset","","0","","7","","","10-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to address this problem, this article investigates acoustic modeling through Multi-Task Learning, with two speaker-related auxiliary tasks. Multi-Task Learning is a regularization method which aims at improving the network's generalization ability, by training a unique model to solve several different, but related tasks. In this article, two auxiliary tasks are jointly examined. On the one hand, we consider speaker classification as an auxiliary task by training the acoustic model to recognize the speaker, or find the closest one inside the training set. On the other hand, the acoustic model is also trained to extract i-vectors from the standard acoustic features. I-Vectors are efficiently applied in the speaker identification community in order to characterize a speaker and its acoustic environment. The core idea of using these auxiliary tasks is to give the network an additional inter-speaker awareness, and thus, reduce overfitting.We investigate this Multi-Task Learning setup on the TIMIT database, while the acoustic modeling is performed using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory cells.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4847-2; POD:978-1-5090-4848-9","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900077","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7900077","","Acoustics;Automatic speech recognition;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Speech;Training","","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we firstly propose a two-layered decomposition of bottleneck stage scheduling problem, in which the subproblem of upper layer can be regarded as an expensive-to-evaluate problem, and the subproblem of lower layer is comparatively easy to solve. Then, we present a differential evolution algorithm combined with a surrogate model to solve the upper-layer subproblem, and the lower-layer subproblem is solved by an effective brand and bound algorithm.

In this proposal, the optimum is determined analytically according to the closed-form solution of the ICLS problem estimated from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.

Among the behaviours of attack sources, repeatable and predictable features differ from source of legitimate traffic. In addition, the DDoS defence systems lack the learning ability to fine-tune their accuracy. This paper analyses real trace traffic from publicly available datasets.

An artificial recurrent multilayer neural network that performs supervised Hebbian learning, called probabilistic associative memory (PAM), was recently proposed. PAM is a recurrent multilayer network of processing units (PUs), each processing unit comprising a group of novel artificial neurons, which generate spike trains. PUs are detectors and recognizers of the feature subvectors appearing in their receptive fields. In supervised learning by a PU, the label of the feature subvector is provided from outside PAM. Since the feature subvector may be shared by many causes and may contain parts from many causes, the label of the feature subvector is sometimes difficult to obtain, not to mention the cost, especially if there are many hidden layers and feedbacks. This paper presents an unsupervised learning scheme, which is Hebbian in the following sense: The strength of a synapse increases if the outputs of the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons are identical and decreases otherwise. This unsupervised Hebbian learning capability makes PAM a good functional model of neuronal networks as well as a good learning machine for temporal hierarchical pattern recognition.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7417-2; POD:978-1-4244-7416-5","10.1109/CISS.2010.5464925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464925","Hebbian learning;learning machine;maximal generalization;multilayer neural network;orthogonal expansion;probability distribution;recurrent neural network;spike trains;unsupervised learning","Artificial neural networks;Associative memory;Biological neural networks;Detectors;Hebbian theory;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Neurons;Pattern recognition;Recurrent neural networks","Hebbian learning;pattern classification;recurrent neural nets;unsupervised learning","artificial neurons;biological neural networks;feature subvectors;learning machine;probabilistic associative memory;processing unit;recurrent multilayer neural networks;spike trains;supervised learning;temporal hierarchical pattern recognition;unsupervised Hebbian learning","","0","","27","","","17-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a control scheme based on a combination of discrete PID controller and discrete direct adaptive neural controller is proposed for the active control of a nonlinear base isolated building to reduce superstructure responses and base drifts under near-fault earthquake excitations. Even though the PID controller is a traditional and widely used in many control applications, the performance of PID controller is not satisfactory in time varying and nonlinear systems. But the efficiency of its performance can be enhanced by combining the PID controller along with neural controller. The neural controller is constructed based on a single hidden layer feed forward network and the parameters of the network are modified using extreme learning machine (ELM) - like algorithm. To ensure the stability of the system, unlike original ELM algorithm, Lyapunov update law is used to update the output parameters of the network. This approach is validated by simulating a non-linear three dimensional benchmark base-isolated structure with time history records of three near-fault earthquakes. The performance of the proposed control scheme is measured in terms of a comprehensive set of performance indices. The results show that the proposed neural aided discrete PID active controller is more effective in reducing the superstructure acceleration, inter-storey drifts and base displacement by giving an active feedback control force to the base-isolated structure.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5769-2; POD:978-1-4673-5766-1; USB:978-1-4673-5768-5","10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606161","Base-Isolation;Extreme Learning Machine;Lyapunov;PID;active control;direct adaptive;discrete;neural controller","Acceleration;Actuators;Buildings;Earthquakes;Equations;Force;Mathematical model","adaptive control;buildings (structures);earthquake engineering;feedforward neural nets;learning systems;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;seismology;structural engineering;three-term control","ELM algorithm;Lyapunov update law;active control devices;base displacement;base drifts;discrete direct adaptive neural controller;extreme learning machine;interstorey drifts;near-fault earthquake excitations;neural aided discrete PID active controller;nonlinear hysteretic base-isolation building;nonlinear systems;nonlinear three dimensional benchmark base-isolated structure;performance indices;seismic protection;single hidden layer feedforward network;smart hybrid base-isolation system;structural control community;superstructure acceleration;superstructure response reduction;time varying systems","","2","","17","","","23-26 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, fault diagnosis used to find clues as to root causes remains a challenging area. In particular, process monitoring using neural networks has been employed to only a limited extent because it is a black box model, making the relationships between input data and output results difficult to interpret in actual manufacturing settings, despite its high classification performance. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, named FDC-CNN, in which a receptive field tailored to multivariate sensor signals slides along the time axis, to extract fault features. This approach enables the association of the output of the first convolutional layer with the structural meaning of the raw data, making it possible to locate the variable and time information that represents process faults.

Approximate algorithms are necessary for graph matching due to its NP-complete nature. Inspired by the usage in network-related tasks, random walk is generalized to graph matching as a type of approximate algorithm. However, it may be inappropriate for the previous random walk-based graph matching algorithms to utilize continuous techniques without considering the discrete property. In this paper, we propose a novel random walk-based graph matching algorithm by incorporating both continuous and discrete constraints in the optimization process. Specifically, after interpreting graph matching by random walk, the continuous constraints are directly embedded in the random walk constraint in each iteration. Further, both the assignment matrix (vector) and the pairwise similarity measure between graphs are iteratively updated according the discrete constraints, which automatically leads the continuous solution to the discrete domain. Comparisons on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2017.2693029","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911332","Feature correspondence;feature extraction;graph matching;image registration;image representation","Approximation algorithms;Computer science;Cybernetics;Linear programming;Machine learning algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Optimization","","","","","","","","20170425","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Unfortunately, the experimental methods for identifying PPIs are both time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is important to develop computational approaches for predicting PPIs. In the present work, we propose a method for PPI prediction using only the information of protein sequences. This method was developed based on learning algorithm-Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) combined with a novel representation of local protein sequence descriptors. The local descriptors account for the interactions between residues in both continuous and discontinuous regions of a protein sequence, thus this method enables us to extract more PPI information from the protein sequences. ELM is a kind of accurate and fast-learning innovative classification method based on the random generation of the input-to-hidden-units weights followed by the resolution of the linear equations to obtain the hidden-to-output weights. When performed on the PPI data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the proposed method achieved 89.09% prediction accuracy with 89.25% sensitivity at the precision of 88.96%. Extensive experiments are performed to compare our method with state-of-the-art techniques Support Vector Machine (SVM). Achieved results show that the proposed approach is very promising for predicting PPI, and it can be a helpful supplement for PPIs prediction.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-3143-2; POD:978-1-4673-3142-5","10.1109/ICCSCE.2012.6487143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487143","extreme learning machine;local descripter;protein sequence;protein-protein interaction","","biology computing;cellular biophysics;learning (artificial intelligence);microorganisms;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;pattern classification;proteins","DNA replication;DNA transcription;ELM;PPI data;PPI information;PPI prediction;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;cellular process;computational approach;continuous regions;discontinuous regions;extreme learning machine;fast-learning innovative classification method;learning algorithm;linear equations;local protein sequence descriptors;metabolic cycles;protein sequence information;protein-protein interactions;random input-to-hidden-unit weights generation;signaling cascades","","0","","23","","","23-25 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical brain decoding paradigm, different types of stimuli are shown to the participant of the neuroimaging experiment, while his/her concurrent brain activity is captured using neuroimaging techniques. Then a machine learning algorithm is employed to categorize the measured brain signal into the target stimuli classes. Accurate prediction of the stimulus category by the algorithm is considered a positive evidence of the hypothesis of the existence of stimulus-related information in brain data. However, most of the brain decoding studies suffer from the constraint of having few and noisy samples. In order to overcome this limitation, in this paper, an adaptation paradigm is employed in order to transfer knowledge from visual domain to brain domain. We experimentally show that such adaptation procedure leads to improved results for the object recognition task in the brain domain, outperforming significantly the results achieved by the brain features alone. This is the first study in the direction of transferring knowledge by adapting representations learned on visual domain to the brain modality. We believe this paper opens up avenues for exploiting large-scale visual datasets to achieve performance gain in brain decoding.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4847-2; POD:978-1-5090-4848-9","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7900295","","Adaptation models;Brain;Decoding;Dictionaries;Machine learning algorithms;Neuroimaging;Visualization","","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various kinds of technologies have been proposed to address this problem, such as mathematical analysis, machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, and precursors signal study. Unfortunately, they usually do not have very good results due to the seemingly dynamic and unpredictable nature of earthquakes. In contrast, we notice that earthquakes are spatially and temporally correlated because of the crust movement. Therefore, earthquake prediction for a particular location should not be conducted only based on the history data in that location, but according to the history data in a larger area. In this paper, we employ a deep learning technique called long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the spatio-temporal relationship among earthquakes in different locations and make predictions by taking advantage of that relationship. Simulation results show that the LSTM network with two-dimensional input developed in this paper is able to discover and exploit the spatio-temporal correlations among earthquakes to make better predictions than before.","2168-6750;21686750","","10.1109/TETC.2017.2699169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7913634","Earthquake Prediction;LSTM;Spatio-Temporal Data mining","Correlation;Data mining;Earthquakes;Machine learning;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines","","","","","","","","20170427","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To implement this fusion task, the entire image sequence is partitioned into spatially and temporally adjacent subsequences. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained for object/nonobject classification on each of these subsequences, the outputs of which act as separate data sources. To combine the discriminative information from these classifiers, we further present a spatio-temporal weighted DS (STWDS) scheme. In addition, temporally adjacent sources are likely to share discriminative information on object/nonobject classification. To use such information, an adaptive SVM learning scheme is designed to transfer discriminative information across sources. Finally, the corresponding DS belief function of the STWDS scheme is embedded into a Bayesian tracking model.

In the majority of LNCSs the fine-tuning process is performed by experienced personnel based on field observations via experimentation with different combinations of controller parameters, without the use of a systematic approach. The existing adaptive/neural/fuzzy control methodologies cannot be used towards the development of a systematic, automated fine-tuning procedure for general LNCS due to the strict assumptions they impose on the controlled system dynamics; on the other hand, adaptive optimization methodologies fail to guarantee an efficient and safe performance during the fine-tuning process, mainly due to the fact that these methodologies involve the use of random perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and analyze, both by means of mathematical arguments and simulation experiments, a new learning/adaptive algorithm that can provide with convergent, an efficient and safe fine-tuning of general LNCS. The proposed algorithm consists of a combination of two different algorithms proposed by Kosmatopoulos (2007 and 2008) and the incremental-extreme learning machine neural networks (I-ELM-NNs). Among the nice properties of the proposed algorithm is that it significantly outperforms the algorithms proposed by Kosmatopoulos as well as other existing adaptive optimization algorithms.

As a secondary goal, we examine incremental learning as an overlooked obstruction to the implementation of reliable real-time recognition. Assuming weak appearance constancy, the shape of an actor is approximated by adaptively changing intensity histograms to extract pyramid histograms of oriented gradient features. As action progresses, the shape update is carried out by adjustment of a few blocks within a tracking window to closely track evolving contours. The nonlinear dynamics of an action are learned using a recursive analytic approach, which transforms training into a simple linear representation. Such a learning strategy has two advantages: 1) minimized error rates, and significant savings in computational time; and 2) elimination of the widely accepted limitations of batch-mode training for action recognition. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is corroborated by experimental validation against the state of the art.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2177182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095611","Action recognition;analytic learning;extreme learning machine;incremental learning;snippets","Feature extraction;Histograms;Shape;Target tracking;Training","image motion analysis;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);video signal processing","batch-mode training;human action recognition;incremental learning;linear representation;nonlinear dynamics;oriented gradient feature;pyramid histogram;recursive analytic approach;snippet;video processing","","34","","45","","20111206","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In contrast to other common strategies that increase depth or breadth of the network, we use image processing domain knowledge to modify the objective function and improve deraining with a modestly sized CNN. Specifically, we train our DerainNet on the detail (high-pass) layer rather than in the image domain. Though DerainNet is trained on synthetic data, we find that the learned network translates very effectively to real-world images for testing.

This can be achieved by installing the proper sized switching capacitor at proper place in a power distribution system. This paper deals with the design of distributed power systems and optimal switching capacitor placements based on the Fuzzy-Extreme Learning Machine (FELM). The intelligent power automation system requires fast determination of site and size of the switchable capacitors in the system bus through the centralized control units based on the system load. But in case of conventional, ANN and other models available on the literature they are time consuming and less performing under a dynamic environment. To overcome this problem, we propose FELM mechanism to obtain an optimal switching capacitor placement in power distributed system. Fuzzy logic and its inference systems are used in ELM and the resultant FELM is to be used to find the site and size dynamically. Finally, the results are compared with a standard 34-bus test system with other models, with respect to the capacitor placement on the networks, savings and the computational time.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-181-6; POD:978-1-61284-180-9","10.1109/FSKD.2011.6019579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6019579","Artificial Neural Networks (ANN);Extreme Learning Machine;Fuzzy Logic;Intelligent power automation system component;Power Flow Problem","Artificial neural networks;Capacitors;Load flow;Load modeling;Switches;Training","centralised control;fuzzy control;learning (artificial intelligence);neurocontrollers;power capacitors;power distribution control;power transmission control","ANN;FELM based intelligent optimal switching capacitor placement;active power loss;centralized control units;dynamic environment;fuzzy logic;fuzzy-extreme learning machine;inference system;intelligent power automation system;power distribution;power transmission;unbalanced power flow problem;voltage drop","","1","","21","","","26-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although commercialized ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance System) products, such as mobileye, could be used for rear-end collision warning, a cost-effective approach is still needed. In this paper, we have developed a novel two-stage approach to detect vehicles and recognize signal lights from a single image in real-time. Distinct from current state-of-the-art light recognition algorithms, we adopted a HDR (High Dynamic Range) camera instead of a color camera. Taking advantage of the different dynamic range of a HDR camera, the detection of a vehicle and the recognition of the signal light have been done in bright and dark channels, respectively. Furthermore, unlike previous approaches where pair taillight has to be extracted explicitly, we use detected vehicle region instead. On a large database, ""Lights Patterns"" (LPs) are learned by a multi-layer perception neural network.

While the current approaches have reported high accuracies at equal error rates, performance at lower false accept rates requires significant improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel face verification algorithm, which starts with selecting feature-rich frames from a video sequence using discrete wavelet transform and entropy computation. Frame selection is followed by representation learning-based feature extraction, where three contributions are presented: 1) deep learning architecture, which is a combination of stacked denoising sparse autoencoder (SDAE) and deep Boltzmann machine (DBM); 2) formulation for joint representation in an autoencoder; and 3) updating the loss function of DBM by including sparse and low rank regularization. Finally, a multilayer neural network is used as the classifier to obtain the verification decision. The results are demonstrated on two publicly available databases, YouTube Faces and Point and Shoot Challenge. Experimental analysis suggests that: 1) the proposed feature-richness-based frame selection offers noticeable and consistent performance improvement compared with frontal only frames, random frames, or frame selection using perceptual no-reference image quality measures and 2) joint feature learning in SDAE and sparse and low rank regularization in DBM helps in improving face verification performance. On the benchmark Point and Shoot Challenge database, the algorithm yields the verification accuracy of over 97% at 1% false accept rate whereas, on the YouTube Faces database, over 95% verification accuracy is observed at equal error rate.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2668221","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7850956","Deep learning;autoencoder;deep Boltzmann machine;face recognition;frame selection","Databases;Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Neural networks;YouTube","","","","","","","","20170213","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Reduced set of features shows better classification accuracy for JPEG steganalysis compared to complete set of features. In our method we used an ensemble classifier to approximate the functional relationship between the reduced feature set and class label. Search for optimal subset of features requires to solve two optimization problems: define the optimal number of features and define the optimal subset itself. Proposed Binary Coded Genetic algorithm enables to solve two optimization problems together. Each feature is coded as a binary coefficient in a binary string, which represent one solution of the feature selection problem. Genetic operations executed for binary strings (parents) results new binary strings (child) with good chance to have higher classification accuracy for JPEG steganalysis. Experimental results clearly indicate the advantage of using the proposed reduced set of features for JPEG steganalysis.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2843-9; POD:978-1-4799-2844-6","10.1109/ISSNIP.2014.6827700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827700","Extreme learning machine;JPEG steganography;steganalysis;undetectable data hiding","Accuracy;Error probability;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Testing;Transform coding","approximation theory;feature selection;genetic algorithms;image classification;image coding;steganography","JPEG steganalysis;binary coded genetic algorithm;binary string;ensemble classifier;feature selection method;feature selection problem;functional relationship approximation;optimization problems","","1","","45","","","21-24 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many scientists are interested in brain research. Therefore, brain science research has become more and more important. Microarray is the most mature technology for studying the whole genome from specific organs, and hoping to discover new marker genes from them. However, the brain science research still does not have a standard platform to analyze microarray data. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid system by using Fuzzy C-Means (supervised) and Self-organizing map (unsupervised) to analyze microarray data from mice's with different calcium channel phenotypes. Based on these experimental results, 14 target genes are found and these genes were also confirmed by biological references. The 14 target genes are all related to memory function. In addition, the cluster results from Fuzzy C-Means are 100%, but only 50% for SOM. In the future this method can be applied to more biological datasets for genetic pathways, which can be used in the understanding of directions and strengths of gene regulatory circuit. Consequently, the relationship between calcium channels and the memory and learning function of brains can be further studied.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0024-7; POD:978-1-4673-0025-4","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6234233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6234233","brain;calcium channel;learning;learning machine;memory learning","Analysis of variance;Bioinformatics;Calcium;Diseases;Educational institutions;Linear regression;Mice","biology computing;data analysis;fuzzy set theory;genomics;lab-on-a-chip;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps","biological datasets;brain science research;brains learning function;calcium channel phenotypes;fuzzy c-means;gene regulatory circuit;genes clustering;genome;mouse brain microarray data analysis;self-organizing maps","","0","","15","","","29-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given significant uncertainties involved in wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting provides a unique solution to estimate and quantify the potential impacts and risks facing system operation with wind penetration beforehand. This paper proposes a novel hybrid intelligent algorithm approach to directly formulate optimal prediction intervals of wind power generation based on extreme learning machine and particle swarm optimization. Prediction intervals with associated confidence levels are generated through direct optimization of both the coverage probability and sharpness to ensure the quality. The proposed method does not involve the statistical inference or distribution assumption of forecasting errors needed in most existing methods. Case studies using real wind farm data from Australia have been conducted. Comparing with benchmarks applied, experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency and reliability of the developed approach. It is therefore convinced that the proposed method provides a new generalized framework for probabilistic wind power forecasting with high reliability and flexibility and has a high potential of practical applications in power systems.","0885-8950;08858950","","10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2288100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6662465","Extreme learning machine;forecasts;particle swarm optimization;prediction intervals;wind power","Forecasting;Linear programming;Power system reliability;Reliability;Training;Wind forecasting;Wind power generation","inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;particle swarm optimisation;power generation reliability;probability;statistical analysis;wind power plants","Australia;distribution assumption;extreme learning machine;hybrid intelligent algorithm approach;optimal prediction interval;particle swarm optimization;power system operation;probabilistic interval forecasting;reliability;statistical inference;wind farm data;wind power forecasting;wind power generation","","41","","38","","20131112","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

But, the number of labeled samples present in these bands that would be used for training is scarce and also the acquisition of the labeled samples is difficult and time consuming. Whereas, the generation of the unlabeled samples is effortless. The Semisupervised Learning (SLL) algorithm helps to obtain the unlabeled samples from a constrained set of labeled samples without much struggle and cost. In proposed method, the semisupervised learning that adapts the Self learning strategies is developed. In the self learning method the machine learning algorithm itself selects the most favorable unlabeled samples for the classification process. Two different approaches are used. First, a segmentation method called the Graph cut technique is used and then the Multilevel Logistic (MLL) classifier is used.

Transient voltage stability is a very fast phenomenon. Therefore, the proposed approach is aimed to provide a quick response to prevent voltage collapse. Generally, time response consists of two parts. Firstly, control center receives signals from the field and then process those signals to determine the appropriate setting of FACTS devices according to load level and location of fault. Secondly, FACTS devices react based on the signals sent by control center to prevent voltage collapse. The total response time should be shorter than the time to voltage collapse. Two kinds of FACTS devices, Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) and Static VAR Compensator (SVC), are used to represent series and shunt type devices, respectively. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, IEEE 14 buses is used as test system.

The linearization residue combined with unmodeled dynamics is then modeled using an extreme learning machine via supervised learning. The minimax methodology is exploited to deal with bounded uncertainties.

Then we feed the resulting features to an extra network placed on the top of the pretrained CNN for further learning. During the fine-tuning phase, we learn the weights of this network by jointly minimizing three regularization terms, which are: 1) the cross-entropy error on the labeled source data; 2) the maximum mean discrepancy between the source and target data distributions; and 3) the geometrical structure of the target data. Furthermore, to obtain robust hidden representations we propose a mini-batch gradient-based optimization method with a dynamic sample size for the local alignment of the source and target distributions.

We investigate the use of Deep Learning, a hierarchical form of machine learning, to model the relationship between hypertension and waveform morphology, giving us the ability to accurately detect presence hypertension. Data from 60 patients, showing intracranial pressure levels over a half hour time span, was used to evaluate the model. We divided each patient's recording into average normalized beats over 30 sec segments, assigning each beat a label of high (i.e. greater than 15 mmHg) or low intracranial pressure.

The app follows closely the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale which is the most commonly used protocol in the clinical study of PD; can be used by patients and their carers at home or in the community; and, requires the user to perform a sequence of iterated movements which are recorded by the phone sensors. This paper discusses how the cloudUPDRS system addresses two key challenges towards meeting essential consistency and efficiency requirements, namely: (i) How to ensure high-quality data collection especially considering the unsupervised nature of the test, in particular, how to achieve firm user adherence to the prescribed movements; and (ii) How to reduce test duration from approximately 25 minutes typically required by an experienced patient, to below 4 minutes, a threshold identified as critical to obtain significant improvements in clinical compliance. To address the former, we combine a bespoke design of the user experience tailored so as to constrain context, with a deep learning approach used to identify failures to follow the movement protocol while at the same time limiting false positives to avoid unnecessary repetition. We address the latter by developing a machine learning approach to personalise assessments by selecting those elements of the UPDRS protocol that most closely match individual symptom profiles and thus offer the highest inferential power hence closely estimating the patent's overall UPRDS score.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4327-9; POD:978-1-5090-4328-6","10.1109/PERCOM.2017.7917848","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917848","","Conferences;Diseases;Machine learning;Market research;Pervasive computing;Protocols;Sensors","","","","","","","","","13-17 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce two kinds of novel features based on social pattern and external attribute knowledge (SPEAK), then integrate the SPEAK features and topological features into a deep learning framework using deep neural networks (DNNs). We present the performance based on a real world academic social network from AMiner. Experimental results demonstrate that the SPEAK features can significantly boost the link prediction performance especially when potential links span large geodesic distance.

It is difficult to use existing computational method to predict miRNA-binding residues in proteins due to the lack of training examples. To address this issue, unlabeled data may be exploited to help construct a computational model. Semisupervised learning deals with methods for exploiting unlabeled data in addition to labeled data automatically to improve learning performance, where no human intervention is assumed. In addition, miRNA-binding proteins almost always contain a much smaller number of binding than nonbinding residues, and cost-sensitive learning has been deemed as a good solution to the class imbalance problem. In this work, a novel model is proposed for recognizing miRNA-binding residues in proteins from sequences using a cost-sensitive extension of Laplacian support vector machines (CS-LapSVM) with a hybrid feature. The hybrid feature consists of evolutionary information of the amino acid sequence (position-specific scoring matrices), the conservation information about three biochemical properties (HKM) and mutual interaction propensities in protein-miRNA complex structures. The CS-LapSVM receives good performance with an F1 score of 26.23 + 2.55% and an AUC value of 0.805 + 0.020 superior to existing approaches for the recognition of RNA-binding residues.

Therefore, reliability optimization of transportation systems has attracted much attention over the past several decades. The traditional reliability optimization design is usually focused on redundancy allocation or reliability redundancy allocation. In practice, the operation process usually has a significant influence on the transportation system lifetime. By combining linear programming (LP) and extreme learning machine (ELM), a two-stage approach is proposed to optimize the transportation system lifetime, in which a semi-Markov model (SMM) is used to model the operation process. In the proposed method, we first formulate the optimization problem as an LP model, and the LP algorithm is utilized to search for the approximate optimal state probabilities. After data production and sample selection, ELM is trained with the produced training data and used to predict the optimal sojourn time distribution parameters. Applications on three different cases demonstrate that a higher lifetime can be ensured for the transportation system by using the proposed method.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2011.2160053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954183","Artificial neural network (ANN);extreme learning machine (ELM);lifetime optimization;linear programming (LP);semi-Markov model (SMM);transportation system","Artificial neural networks;Computational modeling;Linear programming;Optimization;Reliability;Transportation","Markov processes;approximation theory;economics;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;probability;redundancy;transportation","LP algorithm;LP-ELM model;data production;economic cost;extreme learning machine;linear programming;operation process;optimal sojourn time distribution parameter;optimal state probability approximation;reliability optimization design;reliability redundancy allocation;sample selection;semiMarkov model;transportation system lifetime optimization problem;unreliable transportation system","","6","","45","","20110714","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Automatic Han Chinese folk song classification using the musical feature density map","S.

A system employing artificial neural network (ANN) techniques for the classification of Han Chinese folk songs is presented in this paper. Melodies of Han Chinese folk songs are machine-classified according to the different geographical region of the folk song's origin. Both audio and symbolic representations of music are studied. A novel encoding method called musical feature density map (MFDMap) is proposed to encode the symbolic musical features extracted from each folk song for machine classification. Our simulations demonstrate that the regularized extreme learning machine (R-ELM) classifier can achieve 72% classification accuracy using the MFDMap with three of the four suggested symbolic features.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2393-2; POD:978-1-4673-2392-5; USB:978-1-4673-2391-8","10.1109/ICSPCS.2012.6508020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508020","Han Chinese folk song;artificial neural network;extreme learning machine;music classification;musical feature density map","","audio coding;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);music;neural nets;signal classification;signal representation","ANN;MFDMap;R-ELM classifier;artificial neural network;automatic Han Chinese folk song classification;automatic music classification;classification accuracy;encoding method;folk song origin;geographical region;machine classification;melody;music audio representation;music symbolic representation;musical feature density map;regularized extreme learning machine;symbolic musical feature extraction","","0","","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Grey correlation analysis method was used to select the secondary variables of the soft sensing model. It can effectively reduce the dimension of the system. Extreme learning machine regression (ELMR) method was used to build the soft sensing model of biomass concentration of phytoplankton. Comparing with the generalized regression neural network, the testing result indicates that extreme learning machine regression has better accuracy, efficiency and generalization ability of measurement than the other methods. It adapts to be used for real time monitoring of biomass concentration of phytoplankton in seawater.","1948-9439;19489439","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3706-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-3708-0; POD:978-1-4799-3709-7","10.1109/CCDC.2014.6852342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6852342","Biomass concentration of phytoplankton;Extreme learning machine regression;Generalization ability;Secondary variables;Soft sensing","Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Correlation;Neurons;Sea measurements;Sensors;Training","oceanographic techniques;seawater","ELMR method;extreme learning machine regression;grey correlation analysis method;marine disasters;phytoplankton biomass concentration;seawater phytoplankton growth state;soft sensing method;soft sensing model","","0","","12","","","May 31 2014-June 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The quantity used to analyze the problem is the stator current or, more specifically, the harmonic content of its frequency spectrum, also called current signature. The analysis through the current signature is a non-invasive method and may be embedded in the frequency converter, what is a great advantage. The dataset used for training and validating the ANN is obtained using a test bench that allows applying different levels of interturn short-circuits in the machine. It is observed that the fault motor dataset and healthy motor dataset are difficult to separate, which demands a large computational effort to choose a proper MLP topology. The MLP is trained by two different algorithms (the classical error Back propagation - BP - and an adaptation of the newer Extreme Learning Machine - ELM) and the results are thoroughly explored, including after the application of a pruning method called CAPE. Then it is slightly compared with the results of a Self-Organized Map ANN [1] obtained by using the same dataset.","2377-0589;23770589","Electronic:978-1-4799-3194-1; POD:978-1-4799-2232-1","10.1109/BRICS-CCI-CBIC.2013.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6855891","Backpropagation;Extreme Learning Machine;Fault Detection;Frequency Converter Multi-layer Perceptron;Stator Winding Interturn short-circuit","Artificial neural networks;Circuit faults;Harmonic analysis;Induction motors;Neurons;Stator windings;Training","backpropagation;fault diagnosis;frequency convertors;induction motors;multilayer perceptrons;power engineering computing;stators","BP;CAPE;ELM;MLP ANN;MLP topology;MLP training;classical error back propagation;current signature;early interturn short-circuit fault detection;extreme learning machine;fault motor dataset;frequency converter;frequency spectrum;harmonic content;healthy motor dataset;multilayer perceptron artificial neural network;noninvasive method;pruning method;stator current;stator winding interturn short-circuit fault detection;test bench;three-phase converter-fed induction motor","","1","","19","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
