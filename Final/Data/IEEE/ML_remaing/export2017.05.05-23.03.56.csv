The empirical kernel feature space provides a unified framework for the kernelization of all kinds of linear machines: performing a linear machine in the finite-dimensional empirical feature space, its nonlinear kernel machine is then established in the original input data space. This method is different from the conventional kernel-trick based kernelization, and more importantly, the final nonlinear kernel machines, called empirical kernel machines, are shown to be more efficient in many real-world applications, such as face recognition and facial expression recognition, than the kernel-trick based kernel machines.","","POD:978-1-4244-4199-0","10.1109/CCPR.2009.5344130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5344130","","Face recognition;Image processing;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine learning;Pattern analysis;Pattern recognition;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training data","emotion recognition;face recognition;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis","PCA;face recognition;facial expression recognition;finite-dimensional embedding space;finite-dimensional empirical feature space;input data space;kernel feature space;kernel-trick based kernelization;linear discriminant analysis;linear learning machine kernelization","","2","","10","","","4-6 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since individualism in the expression of emotions may occur at various stages of the emotion generation process, human beings may react quite differently to the same stimulus. Consequently, it comes as no surprise that recognition rates reported for a user-dependent system are significantly higher than recognition rates for a user-independent system. Based on empirical data we obtained in our earlier work on the recognition of emotions from biosignals, speech and their combination, we discuss which consequences arise from individual user differences for automated recognition systems and outline how these systems could be adapted to particular user groups.","2156-8103;21568103","POD:978-1-4244-4800-5","10.1109/ACII.2009.5349495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349495","","Appraisal;Audio recording;Automatic speech recognition;Emotion recognition;Humans;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition;Psychology;Speech analysis;System testing","emotion recognition","automated recognition systems;biosignals;emotion generation process;multimodal emotional signals;recognition rates;user independent classification;user-dependent system;user-independent system","","2","","23","","","10-12 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work a theme detection technique has been evolved for more generic domain independent subjectivity detection that classifies sentences with binary feature: opinionated or non-opinionated. Theme detection technique examines sentence level opinion and finally accumulates the opinion clues to reach the discourse level subjectivity. The subjectivity detection system has been evaluated on the multi perspective question answering (MPQA) corpus as well as on Bengali corpus.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we apply information enhancement learning to the SOM. For this purpose, we introduce collective-ness, in which all neurons collectively respond to input patterns, into an enhanced state. Then, this enhanced and collective state should be imitated by the other non-enhanced and relaxed state. We applied the method to an artificial data and three data from the well-known machine learning database.

From a machine learning point of view, this process is an active learning approach. In this paper, we present a new robot learning framework for reproducing this ability in robot grasping. For doing so, we chose a straightforward approach: first, the robot observes a few good grasps by demonstration and learns a value function for these grasps using Gaussian process regression. Subsequently, it chooses grasps which are optimal with respect to this value function using a mean-shift optimization approach, and tries them out on the real system. Upon every completed trial, the value function is updated, and in the following trials it is more likely to choose even better grasping points. This method exhibits fast learning due to the data-efficiency of the Gaussian process regression framework and the fact that the mean-shift method provides maxima of this cost function. Experiments were repeatedly carried out successfully on a real robot system. After less than sixty trials, our system has adapted its grasping policy to consistently exhibit successful grasps.","2153-0858;21530858","POD:978-1-4244-3803-7","10.1109/IROS.2009.5354345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5354345","","Cybernetics;Educational robots;Gaussian processes;Grasping;Humans;Intelligent robots;Machine learning;Robot sensing systems;Robotics and automation;USA Councils","Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;optimisation;self-adjusting systems","Gaussian process regression framework;active learning approach;data efficiency;machine learning;mean shift optimization;real robot system;robot grasping","","2","","20","","","10-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use a semi-supervised machine learning approach to solve the problem. The basic idea of our technique is to learn the mapping between the texture information contained in an image to a possible altitude value. We learn an over complete sparse basis set from a corpus of unlabeled images capturing the texture variations. This is followed by regression of this basis set against a training set of altitudes. Finally, a spatio-temporal Markov Random Field is modeled over the altitudes in test images, which is maximized over the posterior distribution using the MAP estimate by solving a quadratic optimization problem with L1 regularity constraints. The method is evaluated in a laboratory setting with a real helicopter and is found to provide promising results with sufficiently fast turnaround time.","2153-0858;21530858","POD:978-1-4244-3803-7","10.1109/IROS.2009.5354307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5354307","","Computer science;Helicopters;Intelligent robots;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Markov random fields;Robot vision systems;Smart cameras;USA Councils;Unmanned aerial vehicles","Markov processes;aerospace robotics;aircraft;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;optimisation;remotely operated vehicles;robot vision","UAV;autonomous altitude estimation;flight maneuvers;quadratic optimization problem;semisupervised machine learning;single onboard camera;spatio-temporal Markov random field;top-down aerial images;unlabeled images;unmanned aerial vehicle;vision based techniques","","11","","17","","","10-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the last decade, significant progress in computer vision and machine learning literatures has increased the recognition performance of well localized objects. However, the performance of these techniques is still far from human performance, especially in cluttered environments. We believe that the performance gap between robots and humans is due in part to humans' use of an attention system. According to cognitive psychology, the human visual system uses two stages of visual processing to interpret visual input. The first stage is a pre-attentive process perceiving scenes fast and coarsely to select potentially interesting regions. The second stage is a more complex process analyzing the regions hypothesized in the previous stage. These two stages play an important role in enabling efficient use of the limited cognitive resources available. Inspired by this biological fact, we propose a visual attentional object categorization approach for robots that enables object recognition in real environments under a critical time limitation. We quantitatively evaluate the performance for recognition of objects in highly cluttered scenes without significant loss of detection rates across several experimental settings.","2153-0858;21530858","POD:978-1-4244-3803-7","10.1109/IROS.2009.5354590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5354590","","Cognitive robotics;Computer vision;Humans;Layout;Machine learning;Object detection;Object recognition;Performance loss;Psychology;Visual system","clutter;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;object recognition;robot vision","cognitive psychology;cognitive vision;computer vision;efficient scene processing;human visual system;machine learning;object categorization;robots;visual attentional object categorization approach;visual processing","","2","","28","","","10-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach discovers that the embodied learning system can design its own learning process actively, which is different from the conventional passive data-access machine learning. The proposed model is characterized by a function we call the √Ç¬øconfidence√Ç¬ø, and is a measure of the reliability of state control. The confidence for the state can be a good measure to bias the exploration strategy of data sampling, and to direct its attention to areas of learning interest.

Minimal attention has been devoted to finding the minimum set of software metrics that have the same predictive capability as a larger set of metrics - we strive to answer that question in this paper. We present a comprehensive comparison between seven commonly-used filter-based feature ranking techniques (FRT) and our proposed hybrid feature selection (HFS) technique. Our case study consists of a very high-dimensional (42 software attributes) software measurement data set obtained from a large telecommunications system.

Data characterizing techniques have been developed to control learning algorithm selection by using statistical measurements of a dataset. Expanding this framework, we consider a method to reuse objective rule evaluation indices of classification rules such as support, precision, and recall, to measure similarity of different datasets. In this paper, we present a method to characterize given datasets based on objective rule evaluation indices and classification learning algorithms. The experimental results show the method can detect similarity of datasets even if the datasets have totally different attribute sets.

In this paper, we present a novel and systematic multiresolution learning approach for neural network classifiers to improve their generalization performance on classification tasks with feature based input space. The proposed approach adopts agglomerative hierarchical clustering to generate coarser resolution training data from the original data because hierarchical clustering captures the detailed structure of clustering for any given data set in feature space, and an effective algorithm is developed to automatically extract critical coarser resolution levels for each class. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated through experiments on six real-world benchmark data sets, where traditional learning (i.e., single resolution learning) is used as the baseline. The empirical results demonstrate that multiresolution learning significantly improves neural network classifiers' generalization performance when compared to the baseline, especially for very difficult tasks.","2157-0418;21570418","POD:978-1-4244-4746-6","10.1109/NBiS.2009.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349954","feature extraction;hierarchical clustering;multiresolution learning;neural network;spatial entropy;spatial information gain","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Information systems;Machine learning;Neural networks;Signal resolution;Spatial resolution;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;pattern clustering","agglomerative hierarchical clustering;coarser resolution training data generation;generalization performance;multiresolution learning;neural network classifiers","","0","","18","","","19-21 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A classification approach that exploits the same type of feature at all steps of classification, or performs a single level classification, would suffer from the problems related to these factors. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes a text categorization model based on granular partition. This approach transforms text categorization to an optimization problem: given n feature types, to search an optimal partition solution, in which the collection is partitioned into many sub-parts, when every sub-part is represented by features with the suitable feature type that ensures the sub-part has the highest categorization performance, the global categorization performance is the best one in all impossible partition solutions. To get an approximate solution of the proposed model, a multi-level segmentation algorithm is developed, which employs dimidiate strategy, i.e., it uses a classifier with a given feature type to classify the test collection, then divide the test collection into two parts according to the output of the classifier, the part that the classification result is reliable is assigned to the given feature type as a match sub-part, the other part is considered as a new test collection at the next level. The n sub-parts generated for n feature types are considered as an approximate optimal partition solution. The experiments show that the proposed method can consider effectively the two factors and achieve a better performance.","","POD:978-0-7695-3735-1","10.1109/FSKD.2009.484","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358576","Granular Partition;Multi-level segmentation;optimization model;text classificatiopm","Computer science;Educational institutions;Fuzzy systems;Information filtering;Information filters;Machine learning;Natural languages;Partitioning algorithms;Testing;Text categorization","pattern classification;text analysis","granular partition;multilevel segmentation algorithm;optimization problem;text categorization;text categorization model","","0","","8","","","14-16 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many real-world applications, however, entities are often associated with relations of different types and/or from different sources, which can be well captured by multiple undirected graphs over the same set of vertices. How to exploit such multiple sources of information to make better inferences on entities remains an interesting open problem. In this paper, we focus on the problem of clustering the vertices based on multiple graphs in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. As one of our contributions, we propose Linked Matrix Factorization (LMF) as a novel way of fusing information from multiple graph sources. In LMF, each graph is approximated by matrix factorization with a graph-specific factor and a factor common to all graphs, where the common factor provides features for all vertices. Experiments on SIAM journal data show that (1) we can improve the clustering accuracy through fusing multiple sources of information with several models, and (2) LMF yields superior or competitive results compared to other graph-based clustering methods.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:978-1-4244-5242-2","10.1109/ICDM.2009.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360349","clustering;graph;multiple sources;semi-supervised learning","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Data engineering;Data mining;Industrial relations;Inference algorithms;Information resources;Machine learning;Mathematics;Supervised learning","graph theory;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","graph based learning models;graph clustering;linked matrix factorization;semi-supervised learning;undirected graph;unsupervised learning","","43","1","11","","","6-9 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a simple but effective feature extraction for facial beauty classification. 17 geometric features are designed to abstractly represent each facial image. The experiment is based on 510 facial images, high accuracy of 95.3% is obtained for 2-level classification (beautiful or not), but the accuracy of 4-level classification is 77.9% by SVM. The results clearly show that the notion of beauty perceived by human can also be learned by machine through the employment of supervised learning techniques. Furthermore, the finding of big gap between the accuracy of 2-level classification and 4-level classification is interesting and surprising: the high accuracy naturally leads to the conclusion that there indeed exists simplicity and objectiveness underlying the judgment of aesthetical ideal facial attractiveness; In contrast, the relatively low accuracy for 4-level classification indicates that the presented simple feature vectors is not sufficient for the classification of other levels of facial attractiveness.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:978-1-4244-2793-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5346057","Chinese female facial beauty;Facial beauty classification;Support Vector Machine","Cultural differences;Cybernetics;Employment;Feature extraction;Humans;Machine learning algorithms;Psychology;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;USA Councils","face recognition;support vector machines","Chinese female facial beauty;automatic classification;facial image;machine learning algorithm;support vector machine","","4","","20","","","11-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in many real-world applications, the labeled data are often difficult, expensive or time-consuming to obtain. Recently, several semi-supervised feature selection algorithms were proposed, which aim at doing feature selection with the help of some unlabeled data. But such methods assume the labeled and unlabeled data are under the same data distribution. In this paper, we propose a new framework named transferred feature selection (TFS), which uses out-of-domain labeled data to alleviate the lack of same-distribution labeled training data. The out-of-domain data are labeled but have different distributions with the same-distribution data, so most supervised or semi-supervised feature selection algorithms fail to work well with them. The key idea of TFS is to transfer knowledge from the out-of-domain instances to select a feature subset that can yield high prediction accuracy. The framework is then implemented by k-NN method. Analysis and experiments show that TFS can effectively exploit the out-of-domain instances to improve the performance of feature selection.","2375-9232;23759232","POD:978-1-4244-5384-9","10.1109/ICDMW.2009.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360441","","Application software;Bismuth;Computer science;Conferences;Data mining;Labeling;Machine learning;Sun;Testing;Training data","knowledge based systems;pattern recognition","k-NN method;knowledge transfer;labeled training;semi-supervised feature selection;transferred feature selection","","4","","16","","","6-6 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show this phenomenon to be persistent across both temporal and geographic samples of Mobile Call graphs. Through experiments on synthetic graphs, EigenSpokes are shown to be associated with the presence of community structure in these social networks. This is further verified by analysing the eigenvectors of the mobile call graph, which yield nodes that form tightly-knit communities.

We evaluate the system on demonstrations from five different human subjects, showing its ability to correctly focus on the appropriate objects in these demonstrations.","2153-0858;21530858","POD:978-1-4244-3803-7","10.1109/IROS.2009.5353979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5353979","","Biology computing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Educational robots;Humans;Intelligent robots;Learning systems;Machine learning;Object oriented modeling;USA Councils","learning by example;robots","biologically-inspired computational model;robot task learning;task relevance value;task-relevant objects","","0","","19","","","10-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, based on the certainty of word sense in certain language context, a new method is put forward based on ontology to solve the problem of WSD. And also, a prototype is developed to solve the WSD of ""FT"" in Chinese. Ontology is used to describe the knowledge of word and sense, and Jena reasoning rules are used to reason the mean of one ambiguous word.

So discretization of continuous attributes is one of the important steps in preprocessing of extracting knowledge. Traditional discretization algorithms based on clustering need a pre-determined clustering number k, also typically are applied in an unsupervised learning framework. This paper describes such an algorithm, called SX-means (Supervised X-means), which is a new algorithm of supervised discretization of continuous attributes on clustering .The algorithm modifies clusters with knowledge of the class distribution dynamically. And this procedure can not stop until the proper k is found. For the number of clusters k is not pre-determined by the user and class distribution is applied, the random of result is decreased greatly. Experimental evaluation of several discretization algorithms on six artificial data sets show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and can generate a better discretization schema. Comparing the output of C4.5, resulting tree is smaller, less classification rules, and high accuracy of classification.","","POD:978-1-4244-4199-0","10.1109/CCPR.2009.5344142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5344142","","Automation;Classification tree analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Euclidean distance;Machine learning algorithms;Merging;Partitioning algorithms;Simulated annealing;Unsupervised learning","category theory;knowledge acquisition;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","SX-means;categorical attributes;class distribution;continuous attributes;discretization algorithm;discretization schema;knowledge extraction;machine learning algorithms;supervised X-means;supervised clustering;unsupervised learning framework","","1","","16","","","4-6 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of the previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting a single unlabeled example at a time which could be inefficient since the model has to be retrained for every new labeled example. In this paper we propose a novel simple batch mode active learning(BMAL) method based on farthest-first traversal to select a number of informative examples for labeling simultaneously in each iteration. Furthermore, we combine the BMAL with a multi-view framework in order to improve its execution efficiency. The k nearest neighbor(kNN) model is used as the baseline classifier for its simplicity and efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard dataset have shown that our algorithm is more effective than the single mode counterpart and the baseline classifier.","","POD:978-0-7695-3735-1","10.1109/FSKD.2009.495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360055","Batch Mode Active Learning;Multi-View Learning;k nearest neighbor(kNN);text classification","Fuzzy systems;Iterative algorithms;Labeling;Large-scale systems;Learning systems;Machine learning;Measurement uncertainty;Semisupervised learning;Testing;Text categorization","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;text analysis","batch mode active learning;farthest-first traversal method;k nearest neighbor method;multiview text classification","","3","","14","","","14-16 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these problems, this paper presents an innovative event time extraction model.

In this paper, we show how to estimate these conditional quantile functions within a Bayes risk minimization framework using a Gaussian process prior. The resulting non-parametric probabilistic model is easy to implement and allows non-crossing quantile functions to be enforced. Moreover, it can directly be used in combination with tools and extensions of standard Gaussian processes such as principled hyperparameter estimation, sparsification, and quantile regression with input-dependent noise rates. No existing approach enjoys all of these desirable properties.

In this paper, a graphical model, Conditional Random Fields has been used to extract a particular gene-gene relationship called √Ç¬øcoexpression√Ç¬ø from the existing literature. First, a Conditional Random Fields based model has been trained and tested on full-length papers downloaded from PubMed, to label the predicates that talk about coexpression of genes. Proper local and contextual text features at both word and sentence levels are proposed and extracted during the pre-processing step. The classification performance of the model trained based on the proposed features has been compared with the that of Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbor with generalization, and Neural Networks algorithms, and seen to outperform them all. In our second experiment, the proposed ranking scheme, which is based on classification results, is applied to the ranked lists of papers returned by PubMed and Google, respectively. The comparison of our ranked results to that of PubMed and Google demonstrates that our proposed ranking scheme performs better than both in distinguishing a positive paper from a negative paper. In conclusion, this paper describes a specialized classification and ranking framework that can retrieve papers that really talk about coexpression between and among genes based on mining of semantics and not just lexical search.","2375-9232;23759232","POD:978-1-4244-5384-9","10.1109/ICDMW.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360454","","Data mining;Graphical models;Hidden Markov models;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor searches;Neural networks;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Text mining","data mining;information management;information retrieval;medical computing;neural nets;pattern recognition;support vector machines","biomedical research;coexpression predicates;conditional random fields;data mining;gene-gene relationship;graphical model;information extraction;information management;nearest neighbor;neural networks;support vector machines","","0","","14","","","6-6 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, the concepts of generalized approximation space and generalized approximation operators are firstly proposed, and the binary relation, defined over two universes, is reviewed. Afterwards, the relations of the binary relation and the approximation operator are discussed. On one hand, one can see that a binary relation, which satisfied some specific conditions, may determine the special property of the approximation operator. On the other hand, one defines a pair of dual approximation operators over two universes and states the axioms that those must satisfy, these axioms may sufficiently guarantee the existence of certain types of binary relations over two universes.","","POD:978-0-7695-3735-1","10.1109/FSKD.2009.289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5359937","generalized approximation operator;generalized approximation space;induced binary relation;reverse serial;serial","Artificial intelligence;Data analysis;Data mining;Expert systems;Fuzzy systems;Machine learning;Mathematics;Rough sets;Set theory;Statistics","algebra;approximation theory;rough set theory","Pawlak approximation space;algebraic method;generalized approximation operators;generalized approximation space;rough sets theory","","2","","10","","","14-16 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present an approach to model construction, developed by analyzing log traces from a real data center. We compare the automatically-bootstrapped model against a manually-constructed reference model for the same problem set in order to measure what amount of the model can be automatically built.
