For UCT algorithm, Monte-Carlo simulations are performed with the guidance of UCB1 formula, which are averaged to evaluate a specified action. We observe that, as more simulations are performed, later ones usually lead to more accurate results, partly because the level of the search used in the later simulation is deeper and partly because more results are available to direct subsequent simulations. This paper presents a new method to improve the performance of UCT algorithm by increasing the feedback value of the later simulations. And the experimental results in the classical game Go show that our approach increases the performance of Monte-Carlo simulations significantly when exponential models are used.","","POD:978-0-7695-3859-4","10.1109/IITA.2009.331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369603","machine learning;monte-carlo tree search;weight factor","Application software;Backpropagation algorithms;Computational modeling;Distributed computing;Feedback;Financial advantage program;Information technology;Machine learning;Performance evaluation;Telecommunication computing","Monte Carlo methods;backpropagation;games of skill;tree searching","Monte Carlo game tree search;backpropagation modification;classical game Go;exponential models;multi armed bandit problem;tree structured search space","","5","","11","","","21-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The related work has demonstrated that they can get superior performance than applying single machine learning algorithm in detection model. Besides, with the scrutiny of related works, feature selecting and representing techniques are also essential in pursuit of high efficiency and effectiveness. Performance of specified attack type detection should also be improved and evaluated. In this paper, we incorporate information gain (IG) method for selecting more discriminative features and triangle area based support vector machine (TASVM) by combining k-means clustering algorithm and SVM classifier to detect attacks. Our system achieves accuracy of 99.83%, detection rate of 99.88% and false alarm rate of 2.99% on the 10% of KDD CUP 1999 evaluation data set.

A wearable kinematic sensor also informs postural transitions (using pattern recognition) and walk periods (frequency analysis). This data collected from the various sensors are then used to classify each temporal frame into one of the ADL that was previously acquired (seven activities: hygiene, toilet use, eating, resting, sleeping, communication, and dressing/undressing). This is done using support vector machines. We performed a 1-h experimentation with 13 young and healthy subjects to determine the models of the different activities, and then we tested the classification algorithm (cross validation) with real data.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/TITB.2009.2037317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5352277","Activity of daily living (ADL);classification;health smart home;machine learning;support vector machines (SVMs)","Acoustic sensors;Infrared sensors;Intelligent sensors;Laboratories;Monitoring;Multimodal sensors;Senior citizens;Smart homes;Temperature sensors;Wearable sensors","geriatrics;health care;intelligent sensors;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;signal classification;support vector machines;telemedicine","Autonomie Gerontologie Groupes Iso-Ressources scales;French population;Health Smart Home;SVM-based multimodal classification;activities of daily living;autonomy loss;bathroom;door contacts;elderly people monitoring;hygrometry sensor;infrared presence sensors;microphones;postural transitions;smart sensors;sound classification;speech recognition;temperature sensor;walk periods;wearable kinematic sensor","0","130","","36","","20091211","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Typically, most channel equalizers concentrate on reducing the bit error rate, instead of providing accurate posterior probability estimates. We show that the accuracy of these estimates is essential for optimal performance of the channel decoder and that the error rate output by the equalizer might be irrelevant to understand the performance of the overall communication receiver. In this sense, GPC is a Bayesian nonlinear classification tool that provides accurate posterior probability estimates with short training sequences. In the experimental section, we compare the proposed GPC-based equalizer with state-of-the-art solutions to illustrate its improved performance.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2034941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290078","Coding;Gaussian processes;equalization;low-density parity-check (LDPC);machine learning;nonlinear channel;soft-decoding;support vector machine (SVM)","Bit error rate;Communication channels;Decoding;Digital communication;Equalizers;Gaussian processes;Parity check codes;Pollution measurement;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","Gaussian processes;channel coding;channel estimation;equalisers;error statistics;nonlinear codes;parity check codes","Bayesian nonlinear classification tool;GPC;Gaussian processes;bit error rate;channel equalizers;joint nonlinear channel equalization;low-density parity-check channel decoder;posterior probability estimates;soft LDPC decoding","","9","","42","","20091020","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We consider functions with countably infinite domains, that is functions which are mappings from the set of natural numbers to the set of natural numbers. A search algorithm samples points of a given function, producing a sequence of output values. The main result of this paper is that, given two search algorithms, and a function (computable or incomputable), then we can construct a function on which the pair of search algorithms perform identically. What is more, the Kolmogorov complexity of the functions and algorithms is related. We also show that search and bias have a deep connection. With regards to search, the ease with which we find a function in a search space consisting of programs, is the same as bias, (i.e. the preference of the search space towards one function over another). We show this for finite and countable infinite sized search spaces. The law of conservation of generalization states that for every function a learning algorithm does well on, there exists a function on which it does badly. This has previously been proved for functions over finite sized domains. Here we show how this result can be extended to functions over countably infinite sized domains.","","POD:978-1-4244-4754-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358045","bias;induction;machine learning;no free lunch theorem (NFL);optimization;search","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Probability distribution;Sampling methods","learning (artificial intelligence);search problems","Kolmogorov complexity;finite sized domains;incomputable functions;learning algorithm;natural numbers;search algorithm samples;search space;universal search algorithm","","2","","12","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially in live cell imaging, for which fluorescence microscopy is often used, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be extremely low, making automated spot detection a very challenging task. In the past, many methods have been proposed to perform this task, but a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of these methods is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the most frequently used detection methods for this purpose. These include seven unsupervised and two supervised methods. We perform experiments on synthetic images of three different types, for which the ground truth was available, as well as on real image data sets acquired for two different biological studies, for which we obtained expert manual annotations to compare with. The results from both types of experiments suggest that for very low SNRs ( ?? 2), the supervised (machine learning) methods perform best overall. Of the unsupervised methods, the detectors based on the so-called <i>h</i> -dome transform from mathematical morphology or the multiscale variance-stabilizing transform perform comparably, and have the advantage that they do not require a cumbersome learning stage. At high SNRs ( > 5), the difference in performance of all considered detectors becomes negligible.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2009.2025127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5109713","Fluorescence microscopy;image filtering;machine learning;noise reduction;object detection","Biomedical imaging;Detectors;Fluorescence;Image analysis;Machine learning;Object detection;Optical imaging;Optical microscopy;Proteins;Signal to noise ratio","biomedical optical imaging;fluorescence;mathematical morphology;medical image processing;object detection;optical microscopy;unsupervised learning","biological image analysis;fluorescence microscopy;h-dome transform;learning;live cell imaging;mathematical morphology;multiscale variance-stabilizing transform;signal-to-noise ratio;spot detection methods;supervised methods;unsupervised methods","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Discriminant Analysis;Eukaryotic Cells;Green Fluorescent Proteins;HeLa Cells;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Microscopy, Fluorescence;Microtubules;Models, Theoretical;Normal Distribution;Poisson Distribution;ROC Curve;Sensitivity and Specificity","85","","79","","20090623","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The existing approaches to automating schema matching almost focus on computing direct element matches (1:1 matches) between two schemas. However, relationships between real-world schemas involve many complex matches besides 1:1 matches. A new complex schema matching system called NCSM is introduced in this paper. Firstly it can filter unreasonable matches on data types and values by preprocessor, and employs a set of special-purpose searchers in match generator to explore a specialized portion of the search space and discovers 1:1 and complex matches. Then it estimates candidate matches and selects optimal candidate matches by using similarity estimator and match selector respectively. Finally, according to the problem that there are opaque columns in the schemas being matched, it can apply complementary matcher to discover matching relations between opaque columns further more. Thereby it can discover more general, reasonable matching pairs. Experiments show that, NCSM does not only discover matches between schemas roundly, but also improve the matching recall and precision in practice.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5635-2; POD:978-1-4244-5634-5","10.1109/CICC-ITOE.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439260","complex matching;machine learning;schema matching","Computer networks;Computer science education;Educational technology;Information technology;Marine technology;Matched filters;Oceans;Relational databases;Systems engineering education;Underwater communication","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;relational databases;search problems","complex schema matching system;data warehouse;e-commerce;machine learning;opaque columns;search space;similarity estimator","","1","","5","","","30-31 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is difficult to test such applications because often there is no ""test oracle"" to indicate what the correct output should be for arbitrary input. To help address the quality of such software, in this paper we present a technique for testing the implementations of supervised machine learning classification algorithms on which such scientific computing software depends. Our technique is based on an approach called ""metamorphic testing"", which has been shown to be effective in such cases.

This paper gives a deep survey about the state of the art on semantic processing in content-based 3D model retrieval. Firstly, a framework of contend-based 3D model retrieval system integrated with high-level semantics is presented. Secondly, this paper concludes existing researches and divides the way of high-level semantic processing into three main categories: (1) using relevance feedback based on-line learning to integrate effectively users' high level semantic knowledge; (2) using off-line machine learning methods to narrow the gap between high-level semantic knowledge and low-level object representation; (3) using object ontology to define high-level concepts.

In e-maintenance systems, the intelligent fault detection system plays a crucial role for identifying failures. Machine learning techniques are at the core of such intelligent systems and can greatly influence their performance. Applying these techniques to fault detection makes it possible to shorten shutdown maintenance and thus increase the capacity utilization rates of equipment.

This requires more than simply removing personal identifiers from the data because an attacker can still use auxiliary information to infer sensitive individual information. Additional perturbation is necessary to prevent these inferences, and the challenge is to perturb the data in a way that preserves its analytic utility. No existing anonymization algorithm provides both perfect privacy protection and perfect analytic utility. We make the new observation that anonymization algorithms are not required to operate in the original vector-space basis of the data, and many algorithms can be improved by operating in a judiciously chosen alternate basis. A spectral basis derived from the data's eigenvectors is one that can provide substantial improvement. We introduce the term spectral anonymization to refer to an algorithm that uses a spectral basis for anonymization, and give two illustrative examples. We also propose new measures of privacy protection that are more general and more informative than existing measures, and a principled reference standard with which to define adequate privacy protection.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4840345","Privacy;computational disclosure control;machine learning.","","data analysis;data privacy;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;spectral analysis","analytic utility;auxiliary information;eigenvectors;personal identifiers;privacy protection;scientifically useful data;spectral basis;spectral data anonymization;vector-space basis","","5","","37","","20090424","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Acceptable performance of such infrastructures, and hence the availability of online services, rely on a very large number of parameters such as per-process resources and configurable system/application parameters. These parameters are available for collection as performance counters distributed across various machines, but services have had a hard time determining which performance counters to monitor and what thresholds to use for performance alarms in a production environment. In this paper, we present a novel framework called PerfAnalyzer, a storage-efficient and pro-active performance monitoring framework for correlating service health with performance counters. PerfAnalyzer automatically infers and builds health models for any service by running the standard suite of predeployment tests for the service and data mining the resulting performance counter data-set. A filtered set of performance counters and thresholds of alarms are produced by our framework. The health model inferred by our framework can then be used to detect performance degradation and collect detailed data for root-cause analysis in a production environment.

They also cannot dynamically adapt the detection capability to runtime observations to save energy. Therefore, we are motivated to propose Watchdog, a modality-agnostic event detection framework that clusters the right sensors to meet user specified detection accuracy during runtime while significantly reducing energy consumption.

By restricting the number of requirements being analyzed, fewer opportunities exist for introducing errors into the analysis. This can be accomplished by subsetting the requirements and analyzing one subset at a time.Previous work showed that simple natural language processing and machine learning techniques can be used to identify temporal requirements within a set of natural language requirements. This paper builds on that work by detailing our results in applying these techniques to a set of natural-language temporal requirements taken from a current JPL mission and determining whether a requirement is one of the most frequently occurring types of temporal requirements.The ability to distinguish between different LTL patterns in natural-language requirements raises the possibility of automating the transformation of natural-language temporal requirements into LTL expressions. This would allow automated consistency checking and tracing of natural-language temporal requirements. Since correctness properties are often specified as LTL expressions, this would also provide a set of correctness properties against which abstract models of the system could be verified.","1071-9458;10719458","POD:978-1-4244-5375-7","10.1109/ISSRE.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362112","machine learning;natural language processing;requirements analysis;temporal requirements","Automata;Formal specifications;Frequency;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Pattern analysis;Programming;Propulsion;Software reliability","formal specification;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;temporal logic","JPL mission;LTL patterns;automated consistency checking;automated identification;correctness properties;machine learning techniques;natural-language temporal requirements analysis;requirements classification;requirements subset","","5","","18","","","16-19 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The underlying idea is to learn a map from input low-resolution images to target high-resolution images based on example pairs of input and output images. Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is adopted for this purpose. To reduce the time complexity of training and testing for KRR, a sparse solution is found by combining the ideas of kernel matching pursuit and gradient descent. As a regularized solution, KRR leads to a better generalization than simply storing the examples as has been done in existing example-based algorithms and results in much less noisy images. However, this may introduce blurring and ringing artifacts around major edges as sharp changes are penalized severely. A prior model of a generic image class which takes into account the discontinuity property of images is adopted to resolve this problem. Comparison with existing algorithms shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5396341","Computer vision;display algorithms.;image enhancement;machine learning","Displays;Energy resolution;Image enhancement;Image resolution;Kernel;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Matching pursuit algorithms;Spatial resolution;Testing","gradient methods;image matching;image resolution;regression analysis","Kernel ridge regression;gradient descent;image resolution;kernel matching pursuit;natural image prior;sparse regression","","213","2","24","","20100122","June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, the association between MS signals and these proteins is not straightforward. The need to interpret mass spectra demands the development of methods for accurate labeling of ion species in such profiles. To aid this process, we have developed a new peak-labeling procedure for associating protein and peptide labels with peaks. This computational method builds upon characteristics of proteins expected to be in the sample, such as the amino sequence, mass weight, and expected concentration within the sample. A new probabilistic score that incorporates this information is proposed.

In the prediction stage, we focus on the design of the fusion of the weak learner ensemble. In contrast with the traditional static weight allocation method based on the overall data set, we propose a dynamic weight allocation method, based on the performance of an individual weak learner on the subset. The idea behind this method was to use a test sample's neighbors to estimate the accuracy and bias of the individual weak learner when the learner is used to make the prediction. An improved hyperrectangle neighborhood defining method is proposed in this paper.

Despite emerging technologies, reviewing capsule endoscopic video is a labor intensive task and very time consuming. Computational tools which automatically detect informative frames and tag abnormal conditions such as bleeding, ulcer or tumor will dramatically reduce the clinician's effort. In this paper, we explored various machine-learning methodologies based on different feature extraction and selection criteria, and developed an optimized classification method. The experiment results shows that, comparing to texture feature, using color feature for classification achieved better accuracy, regardless of machine-learning method chosen. The proposed method has been applied in real data taken from capsule endoscopic exams. For informative frames detection, classification method using color feature gives an accuracy of 94.10% and 93.44% for support vector machines (SVM) and neural network (NN) classifiers respectively. For the bleeding detection using color feature, the accuracy achieved 99.41% and 98.97% for SVM and NN respectively. In addition, we also investigated the computational time required for feature extraction and classification. In our experiments, color feature significantly outperformed texture feature in WCE image classification. The overall computational time (per frame) using color feature is 0.7125s (informative frame with SVM), 1.0329s (informative frame with NN), 0.51s (bleeding frame with SVM) and 1.2163s (bleeding frame with NN).

This paper proposes a new machine-learning framework that exploits past observations of the error rate and the associated channel-state information to predict the best modulation order and coding rate for new realizations of the channel state without modeling the input-output relationship of the wireless transceiver. Our approach is enabled through our new error-rate expression that is only parameterized by postprocessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), ordered over subcarriers and spatial streams. Using ordered SNRs, we propose a low-dimensional feature set that enables machine learning to increase the accuracy of link adaptation. An IEEE 802.11n simulation study validates the application of this machine-learning framework in real channels and demonstrates the improved performance of SNR ordering as it compares with competing link-quality metrics.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2009.2029693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200378","Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC);IEEE 802.11n;convolutional coding;machine learning;multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM);signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ordering;supervised learning","","MIMO communication;OFDM modulation;convolutional codes;learning (artificial intelligence);radio links","IEEE 802.11n simulation;SNR ordering;bit interleaving;channel-state information;convolutionally coded MIMO-OFDM wireless systems;error rates;link adaptation;link-quality metrics;machine-learning framework;modulation order;multiple-input-multiple-output systems;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratios;supervised learning;wireless transceiver","","31","2","49","","20090811","Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They identify software subsystems (modules,components, classes, or files) which are likely to contain faults. These subsystems, in turn, receive additional resources for verification and validation activities. Fault prediction models are binary classifiers typically developed using one of the supervised learning techniques from either a subset of the fault data from the current project or from a similar past project. In practice, it is critical that such models provide a reliable prediction performance on the data not used in training. Variance is an important reliability indicator of software fault prediction models. However, variance is often ignored or barely mentioned in many published studies. In this paper, through the analysis of twelve data sets from a public software engineering repository from the perspective of variance, we explore the following five questions regarding fault prediction models: (1) Do different types ofclassification performance measures exhibit different variance? (2) Does the size of the data set imply a more (or less) accurate prediction performance? (3) Does the size of training subset impact model's stability? (4) Do different classifiers consistently exhibit different performance in terms of model's variance? (5) Are there differences between variance from 1000 runs and 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation experiments? Our results indicate that variance is a very important factor in understanding fault prediction models and we recommend the best practice for reporting variance in empirical software engineering studies.","1071-9458;10719458","POD:978-1-4244-5375-7","10.1109/ISSRE.2009.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362090","fault prediction models;machine learning;variance","Analysis of variance;Data analysis;Fault diagnosis;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Software engineering;Software measurement;Software quality;Stability;Supervised learning","learning (artificial intelligence);software fault tolerance;software quality;statistical analysis","binary classifier;reliability indicator;software fault prediction model;software quality assurance;supervised learning;variance analysis","","18","","29","","","16-19 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computational time is reduced by initializing the system with an original variant of multiplicative harmonic NMF, which is described as well. The algorithm is then applied to perform polyphonic piano music transcription. It is compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, especially NMF-based. Convergence issues are also discussed on a theoretical and experimental point of view. Bayesian NMF with harmonicity and temporal continuity constraints is shown to outperform other standard NMF-based transcription systems, providing a meaningful mid-level representation of the data. However, temporal smoothness has its drawbacks, as far as transients are concerned in particular, and can be detrimental to transcription performance when it is the only constraint used.

Offline adaptive libraries are simpler to use, but, unfortunately, writing the adaptation heuristics that power them is a daunting task. The overhead of online adaptive libraries, on the other hand, makes them unsuitable for a number of applications. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate heuristics in the form of decision trees using a statistical classifier, effectively converting an online adaptive library into an offline one.

Such nesting not only reflects the true sets being estimated, but is also desirable for applications requiring the simultaneous estimation of multiple sets, including clustering, anomaly detection, and ranking. We propose new quadratic programs whose solutions give rise to nested versions of one-class and cost-sensitive SVMs. Furthermore, like conventional SVMs, the solution paths in our construction are piecewise linear in the control parameters, although here the number of breakpoints is directly controlled by the user. We also describe decomposition algorithms to solve the quadratic programs. These methods are compared to conventional (non-nested) SVMs on synthetic and benchmark data sets, and are shown to exhibit more stable rankings and decreased sensitivity to parameter settings.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2036071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5313957","Cost-sensitive support vector machine (SC-SVM);machine learning;nested set estimation;one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM);pattern classification;solution paths","","learning (artificial intelligence);piecewise linear techniques;quadratic programming;support vector machines","decomposition algorithms;density level sets;machine learning;nested support vector machines;piecewise linear control;quadratic programs;weighted classification problems","","17","","27","","20091106","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

More specifically, this paper aims to offer two main contributions to the area of protein function prediction. First, it presents the case for discovering comprehensible protein function prediction models from data, discussing in detail the advantages of such models, namely, increasing the confidence of the biologist in the system's predictions, leading to new insights about the data and the formulation of new biological hypotheses, and detecting errors in the data.

It has been reported in many studies that HbAlc has high predictive capacity with respect to T2DM. In order to investigate directly the predictive role of HbAlc, a rough sets approach was used, utilising the classification feature of this machine learning approach. The HbAlc feature was discretised over a range of values (4.0-8.0) and the classification accuracy was established for each level. The first result of this study worth noting is that HbAlc was a significant feature associated with T2DM.

The ¿¿searchlight¿¿ mapping approach, where the brain volume is exhaustively scanned with a fixed-size search volume, is highly appealing in terms of sensitivity but also exceedingly time consuming. We therefore propose an efficient, easily-implemented particle swarm optimization (PSO) brain mapping method, where fixed-size, fixed-shape (spherical) particles search the brain volume for informative regions where a classifier can decode the mind states. Particle positions and velocities are encoded in Cartesian coordinates, and niching techniques are used to identify multiple informative brain regions. We demonstrate the versatility of the algorithm in combination with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and linear and non-linear support vector machines (SVMs) to decode brain states on simulated as well as authentic fMRI data. The PSO method outperformed the conventional general linear model (GLM) method in terms of mapping sensitivity, and compared favorably with the ¿¿searchlight¿¿ algorithm - for a dramatic reduction in time requirements (e.g. 6.7 min compared to 9 h for a minute reduction in mapping sensitivity). On the authentic fMRI dataset, expected brain regions were identified. The PSO algorithm is a promising highly efficient multivariate alternative for functional brain mapping and brain state decoding.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5586-7; POD:978-1-4244-5569-0","10.1109/ICCAE.2010.5451309","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5451309","Particle swarm optimization;brain, neuroscience;data mining;functional magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;support vector machines","Brain mapping;Brain modeling;Decoding;Humans;Linear discriminant analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Particle swarm optimization;Pattern recognition;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","biology;biology computing;biomedical MRI;brain;particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines","Cartesian coordinates;brain state decoding;brain volume;classifier-based multivariate pattern recognition;fixed shape particles search;fixed size particles search;fixed size search volume;functional brain mapping;functional magnetic resonance imaging data;general linear model method;human brain activity patterns;informative brain regions;linear discriminant analysis;mapping sensitivity;particle swarm optimization brain mapping;searchlight algorithm;searchlight mapping;support vector machines","","0","","36","","","26-28 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach aims at automatically adapting the information extraction knowledge previously learned from a source Web site to a new unseen site, at the same time, discovering previously unseen attributes. Two kinds of text-related clues from the source Web site are considered. The first kind of clue is obtained from the extraction pattern contained in the previously learned wrapper. The second kind of clue is derived from the previously extracted or collected items. A generative model for the generation of the site-independent content information and the site-dependent layout format of the text fragments related to attribute values contained in a Web page is designed to harness the uncertainty involved. Bayesian learning and expectation-maximization (EM) techniques are developed under the proposed generative model for identifying new training data for learning the new wrapper for new unseen sites. Previously unseen attributes together with their semantic labels can also be discovered via another EM-based Bayesian learning based on the generative model. We have conducted extensive experiments from more than 30 real-world Web sites in three different domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4906994","Web mining;Wrapper adaptation;machine learning.;text mining","","Bayes methods;Web sites;data mining;expectation-maximisation algorithm;information retrieval systems;learning (artificial intelligence)","Bayesian learning framework;EM-based Bayesian learning;Web information knowledge extraction;Web page;Web sites;expectation-maximization techniques;information extraction wrappers;pattern extraction;site-dependent layout format;site-independent content information;text fragments;text-related clues;training","","10","1","34","","20090502","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper uses the morphological clustering and analysis of ICP (MOCAIP) algorithm to derive 24 metrics characterizing morphology of ICP pulses and test the hypothesis that preintracranial hypertension (Pre-IH) segments of ICP can be differentiated, using these morphological metrics, from control segments that were not associated with any ICP elevation or at least 1 h prior to ICP elevation. Furthermore, we investigate whether a global optimization algorithm could effectively find the optimal subset of these morphological metrics to achieve better classification performance as compared to using full set of MOCAIP metrics. The results showed that Pre-IH segments, using the optimal subset of metrics found by the differential evolution algorithm, can be differentiated from control segments at a specificity of 99% and sensitivity of 37% for these Pre-IH segments 5 min prior to the ICP elevation. While the sensitivity decreased to 21% for Pre-IH segments, 20 min prior to ICP elevation, the high specificity of 99% was retained. The performance using the full set of MOCAIP metrics was shown inferior to results achieved using the optimal subset of metrics. This paper demonstrated that advanced ICP pulse analysis combined with machine learning could potentially leads to the forecasting of ICP elevation so that a proactive ICP management could be realized based on these accurate forecasts.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2009.2037607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447591","Brain injury;differential evolution (DE);intracranial hypertension;intracranial pressure (ICP);machine learning","","brain;injuries;learning (artificial intelligence);neurophysiology;patient care;patient diagnosis;pattern clustering;pressure measurement","ICP elevation forecasting;ICP pulse analysis;MOCAIP algorithm;health care professionals;interventions of intracranial pressure;intracranial pressure waveform morphology;machine learning;morphological clustering and analysis of ICP;morphological metrics;neurocritical care;preintracranial hypertension;significant mean ICP elevation;sustained ICP elevation","Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Forecasting;Humans;Intracranial Hypertension;Intracranial Pressure;Manometry;Models, Neurological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Prognosis","23","","28","","","May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper studies a simplified model of such inference problems in which one or more Boolean variables, modeling, for example, the expression levels of genes, each depend deterministically on a small but unknown subset of a large number of Boolean input variables. Our model assumes that the expression data comprises a time series, in which successive samples may be correlated. We provide bounds on the expected amount of data needed to infer the correct relationships between output and input variables. These bounds improve and generalize previous results for Boolean network inference and continuous-time switching network inference. Although the computational problem is intractable in general, we describe a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm that is guaranteed to provide at least a partial solution to the problem. Most interestingly, both the sample complexity and computational complexity of the problem depend on the strength of correlations between successive samples in the time series but in opposing ways. Uncorrelated samples minimize the total number of samples needed while maximizing computational complexity; a strong correlation between successive samples has the opposite effect. This observation has implications for the design of experiments for measuring gene expression.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2008.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497188","Clustering;Feature extraction or construction;Machine learning;Parameter learning;and association rules;association rules.;classification;clustering;feature extraction or construction;parameter learning;time-series analysis","","Boolean algebra;biology computing;genetics;molecular biophysics","Boolean input variables;Boolean modeling;Boolean network inference;a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm;computational complexity;continuous-time switching network inference;gene expression;learning boolean networks;sample complexity;time-series data","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Gene Expression Profiling;Logistic Models;Models, Biological;Proteome;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Signal Transduction;Time Factors","12","","25","","20080425","Jan.-March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, there are some shortcomings of it, such as its requiring a user to give out the number of clusters at first, and its sensitiveness to initial conditions, and its easily getting to the trap of a local solution et cetera. The global K-means algorithm proposed by Likas et al is an incremental approach to clustering that dynamically adds one cluster center at a time through a deterministic global search procedure consisting of N (with N being the size of the data set) runs of the K-means algorithm from suitable initial positions. It avoids the depending on any initial conditions or parameters, and considerably outperforms the K-means algorithms, but it has a heavy computational load. In this paper, we propose a new version of the global K-means algorithm. The outstanding feature of our algorithm is its superiority in execution time. It takes less run time than that of the available global K-means algorithms. This great advantage is due to that we improved the way of creating the next cluster center in the global K-means algorithm. We defined a novel function to select the optimal candidate center for the next cluster enlightened by the idea of K-medoids clustering algorithm suggested by Park and Jun. Experiments on some well-known data sets from UCI and on a synthetic data set show that our new algorithm can significantly reduce the computational time without affecting the performance of the global K-means algorithm. The further experiments demonstrate that our improved algorithm outperforms the global K-means algorithm greatly.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6389-3; POD:978-1-4244-6388-6","10.1109/ETCS.2010.347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460041","K-means clustering;clustering;data mining;global K-means clustering;machine learning;non-smooth optimization;pattern recognition","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Computer science education;Data mining;Educational technology;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization methods;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern recognition","pattern clustering","fast algorithm;global K-means clustering;global search procedure;simple algorithm","","11","","11","","","6-7 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we implement active learning on the Simon robot in the form of nonverbal gestures that query a human teacher about a demonstration within the context of a social dialogue. Our preliminary pilot study data show potential for transparency through active learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the teaching process.

Cardiac arrhythmia is a very common type of CVD and may indicate an increased risk of stroke or sudden cardiac death. The ECG is the most widely adopted clinical tool to diagnose and assess the risk of arrhythmia. ECGs measure and display the electrical activity of the heart from the body surface. During patients' hospital visits, however, arrhythmias may not be detected on standard resting ECG machines, since the condition may not be present at that moment in time. While Holter-based portable monitoring solutions offer 24-48 h ECG recording, they lack the capability of providing any real-time feedback for the thousands of heart beats they record, which must be tediously analyzed offline. In this paper, we seek to unite the portability of Holter monitors and the real-time processing capability of state-of-the-art resting ECG machines to provide an assistive diagnosis solution using smartphones.

Management costs require a technically skilled human intellect, amounting to a substantial part of total cost of ownership. Self-management is positioned as a key capacity towards a scalable future Internet architecture. Herein we present key technological enablers for self-manageable future Internet systems, namely monitoring, decision-making and machine learning. We survey the state-of-the-art in network management aspects of these thematic areas and present a use case where their synergetic capacities render solutions to a known transport problem in wireless settings. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion of important issues for these technological enablers in the context of future Internet.","","POD:978-1-4244-5166-1","10.1109/ComputationWorld.2009.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5359638","Future Internet;decision-making;machine learning;monitoring;self-organization","Condition monitoring;Costs;Decision making;Electronic mail;Humans;IP networks;Machine learning;Protocols;Telecommunication computing;Web and internet services","Internet;computer network management;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence)","Internet architecture;decision-making;machine learning;network management;self-manageable future Internet element","","3","","35","","","15-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Assessing performances of unsupervised and supervised neural networks in breast cancer detection","S. Belciug; F. Gorunescu; M. Gorunescu; A. B. M.

By revealing their equivalence on such a complete database (i.e. including both input and output), it is to be expected that in a real-world situation of a non-labeled database (i.e. patients without previous diagnosis), only the unsupervised method represented by SOFM will be able to make a good decision without the benefit of a supporting teacher.","","Electronic:978-977-403-396-4; POD:978-1-4244-5828-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5461757","Java implementation;breast cancer;machine learning;medical informatics;neural networks;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","Biological neural networks;Breast cancer;Cancer detection;Computer science;Feedforward neural networks;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Spatial databases;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","cancer;feedforward neural nets;medical computing;multilayer perceptrons;radial basis function networks;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","Kohonen map;breast cancer detection;classical feedforward neural networks;multilayer neural networks;nonlabeled database;probabilistic neural networks;radial basis function;self organizing feature maps;supervised learning;supervised neural networks;unsupervised learning method","","0","","11","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Trawling Traffic under Attack, Overcoming DDoS Attacks by Target-Controlled Traffic Filtering","S. Dolev; Y. Elovici; A. Kesselman; P. Zilberman","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Ben-Gurion Univ. of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel","2009 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies","20100217","2009","","","336","341","As more and more services are provided by servers via the Internet, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks pose an increasing threat to the Internet community. A DoS attack overloads the target server with a large volume of adverse requests, thereby rendering the server unavailable to Â¿well-behavedÂ¿ users. Recently, the novel paradigm of traffic ownership that enables the clients of Internet service providers (ISP) to configure their own traffic processing policies has gained popularity. In this paper, we propose two algorithms belonging to this paradigm that allow attack targets to dynamically filter their incoming traffic based on a distributed policy. The proposed algorithms defend the target against DoS and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks and simultaneously ensure that it continues to receive valuable users' traffic. In a nutshell, a target can define a filtering policy which consists of a set of traffic classification rules and the corresponding amounts of traffic, measured in bandwidth units, which match each rule. The filtering algorithm is enforced by the ISP's or the Network Service Provider's (NSP) routers when a target is being overloaded with traffic. The goal is to maximize the amount of filtered traffic forwarded to the target, according to the filtering policy, from the ISP's or the NSP's network. The first algorithm we propose relies on complete collaboration among the ISP/NSP routers. It computes the filtering policy in polynomial time and delivers the best possible traffic mix to the target. The second algorithm is a distributed algorithm which assumes no collaboration among the ISP/NSP routers, each router only uses local information about its incoming traffic. We show the intuition behind the proof of lower bound on the second algorithm's worst-case performance.","2379-5352;23795352","POD:978-0-7695-3914-0","10.1109/PDCAT.2009.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5372783","DDoS;Filtering Policy;ISP;Machine Learning;NSP;Network Security;Traffic Shaping","Bandwidth;Collaboration;Computer crime;Information filtering;Information filters;Matched filters;Measurement units;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attacks;ISP/NSP routers;Internet community;Internet service providers;adverse requests;attack targets;bandwidth units;distributed algorithm;distributed denial-of-service attacks;distributed policy;filtering algorithm;filtering policy;incoming traffic;local information;network service provider routers;polynomial time;target server;target-controlled traffic filtering;traffic classification rules;traffic ownership;traffic processing policies;trawling traffic;valuable user traffic;well-behaved users","","4","","23","","","8-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
