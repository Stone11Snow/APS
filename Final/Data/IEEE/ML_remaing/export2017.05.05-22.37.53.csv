However, effect of change in body-weight is also an interesting covariate that has not been much explored. This paper presents a novel approach to incorporate the weight variations during feature learning process. In a deep learning architecture, we propose incorporating the body-weight in terms of a regularization function which helps in learning the latent variables representative of different weight categories. The formulation has been proposed for both Autoencoder and Deep Boltzmann Machine. On extended WIT database of 200 subjects, the comparison with a commercial system and an existing algorithm show that the proposed algorithm outperforms them by more than 9% at rank-10 identification accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8776-4; POD:978-1-4799-8777-1","10.1109/BTAS.2015.7358791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358791","","Databases;Decoding;Encoding;Face;Face recognition;Machine learning;Training","Boltzmann machines;face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence)","age variations;autoencoder;deep Boltzmann machine;face image recognition;face recognition;feature learning process;mathematical models;regularization function;regularizing deep learning architecture;weight variations","","1","","14","","","8-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many research works have attempted to provide a model using statistical or intelligent methods. In this respect, this paper adopts a two-stage hybrid model that integrates Deep Learning and Support Vector Machine as a FDP modeling method. Local receptive fields is a technique used in order to select the nodes for each layer of our deep network. Then, stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machine is applied to form a Deep Belief Network as pre-training. Subsequently, Support Vector Machine follows for classification. An experiment over a sample of French firms offers accuracy details about this method. The proposed model actually provides a result of 76,8% instances that are correctly classified.

Traditional methods of opinion gathering involved the use of questioners and interviews which solely depend on the good will of the people to be interviewed. Most research on sentiment analysis focused on social networks, product reviews and also on the stock market. Less research has been covered on analysis of news comments. This research embarks on a hybrid approach to sentiment analysis of news comments which involves using sentiment lexicon for polarity detection (polarity will be classified as positive, negative and neutral). The results from the lexicon based method are then used to train machine learning algorithms. Two algorithms employed in this research are the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour (kNN).

Castanon","Silicon Valley Laboratory, IBM San Jose, USA","2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","20151228","2015","","","2404","2408","Emoticons (e.g., :) and :( ) have been widely used in sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks as features to machine learning algorithms or as entries of sentiment lexicons. In this paper, we argue that while emoticons are strong and common signals of sentiment expression on social media the relationship between emoticons and sentiment polarity are not always clear. Thus, any algorithm that deals with sentiment polarity should take emoticons into account but extreme caution should be exercised in which emoticons to depend on. First, to demonstrate the prevalence of emoticons on social media, we analyzed the frequency of emoticons in a large recent Twitter data set. Then we carried out four analyses to examine the relationship between emoticons and sentiment polarity as well as the contexts in which emoticons are used. The first analysis surveyed a group of participants for their perceived sentiment polarity of the most frequent emoticons. The second analysis examined clustering of words and emoticons to better understand the meaning conveyed by the emoticons. The third analysis compared the sentiment polarity of microblog posts before and after emoticons were removed from the text. The last analysis tested the hypothesis that removing emoticons from text hurts sentiment classification by training two models with and without emoticons in the text, respectively. The results confirms the arguments that: 1) a few emoticons are strong and reliable signals of sentiment polarity and one should take advantage of them in any sentiment analysis; 2) a large group of the emoticons conveys complicated sentiment hence they should be treated with extreme caution.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9926-2; POD:978-1-4799-9927-9","10.1109/BigData.2015.7364034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7364034","Twitter;emoticon;polarity;sentiment;social media","Big data;Context;Machine learning algorithms;Media;Reliability;Sentiment analysis;Twitter","pattern classification;pattern clustering;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","NLP tasks;Twitter data set;emoticons;machine learning algorithms;microblog posts;sentiment analysis;sentiment classification;sentiment expression;sentiment lexicons;sentiment polarity;social media;words clustering","","","","20","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel instance selection technique termed Fuzzy Rough Set Prototype Selection for Regression (FRPS-R) for solving regression problems, where the outcome is continuous. We use concepts from fuzzy rough set theory and extend the currently well-known fuzzy rough set prototype selection technique to model the quality of all available elements and then use a wrapper approach to select an optimal subset of high-quality instances; thereby generalizing the idea.

This generic method was originally introduced by Flajolet and Martin [FOCS'83] in order to save a factor Î©(k) of time per element over k independent samples when estimating the number of distinct elements in a data stream. It was also used in the widely used HyperLogLog algorithm of Flajolet et al. [AOFA'97] and in large-scale machine learning by Li et al. [NIPS'12] for minwise estimation of set similarity. The main issue of k-partition, is that the contents of different bins may be highly correlated when using popular hash functions. This means that methods of analyzing the marginal distribution for a single bin do not apply. Here we show that a tabulation based hash function, mixed tabulation, does yield strong concentration bounds on the most popular applications of k-partitioning similar to those we would get using a truly random hash function. The analysis is very involved and implies several new results of independent interest for both simple and double tabulation, e.g. a simple and efficient construction for invertible bloom filters and uniform hashing on a given set.","0272-5428;02725428","Electronic:978-1-4673-8191-8","10.1109/FOCS.2015.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7354457","Hashing;concentration bounds;constant moments;invertible bloom filters;joint distributions;k-partition;peelability;tabulation hashing;uniform hashing","Computer science;Correlation;Estimation;Frequency estimation;Machine learning algorithms;Polynomials;Yttrium","data structures;estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);statistics","HyperLogLog algorithm;hash function;invertible Bloom filters;k-partitioning;large-scale machine learning;minwise estimation;statistics","","1","","42","","","17-20 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet, when people submit some requirements through short texts, they hope to get a feedback which can help them to solve their problems rather than relevant content. Sometimes people need corresponding intention rather than similar content. However, current researches cannot solve the problem well. In this paper, we propose an intentiontopic model: Verb-Biterm Topic Model(V-BTM), which aims at corresponding intention matching. Intention is expressed by verbs and topic is expressed by BTM. Intention is the action of people want to express and topic is the goal of the intention. The key of the model is that people tend to express their intention with verbs and tend to express the topic with non-verb. In this model, firstly, we distinguish intentions with the verb clustering with the help of word2vec which is a deep learning tool. Secondly, we mine the topic using Biterm Topic Model(BTM) on the data without verbs. We carry out experiments on real-world short text collections. The results demonstrate that our approach can get better verb clustering and mine more coherent topics. Furthermore, the new model can be the base of our future researches.","","CD:978-1-5090-0153-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363164","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Data models;Machine learning;Probability distribution;Semantics","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;pattern matching;text analysis","Twitter;V-BTM;Verb-Biterm topic model;Web 2.0;classified information Web site;deep learning tool;intention matching;intention-topic model;microblog;real-world short text collections;short text topic mining;status messages;verb clustering;word2vec","","","","27","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, recent research has shown that automatic optimization techniques are able to accelerate this optimization process and find hyperparameter configurations that lead to better models. Currently, transferring knowledge from previous experiments to a new experiment is of particular interest because it has been shown that it allows to further improve the hyperparameter optimization. We propose to transfer knowledge by means of an initialization strategy for hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to the current state of the art initialization strategies, our strategy is neither limited to hyperparameter configurations that have been evaluated on previous experiments nor does it need meta-features. The initial hyperparameter configurations are derived by optimizing for a meta-loss formally defined in this paper. This loss depends on the hyperparameter response function of the data sets that were investigated in past experiments. Since this function is unknown and only few observations are given, the meta-loss is not differentiable. We propose to approximate the response function by a differentiable plug-in estimator. Then, we are able to learn the initial hyperparameter configuration sequence by applying gradient-based optimization techniques. Extensive experiments are conducted on two meta-data sets. Our initialization strategy is compared to the state of the art for initialization strategies and further methods that are able to transfer knowledge between data sets. We give empirical evidence that our work provides an improvement over the state of the art.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8273-1; POD:978-1-4673-8274-8","10.1109/DSAA.2015.7344817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344817","","Data models;Gaussian processes;Information systems;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization;Predictive models","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);meta data;optimisation","automatic optimization technique;data mining domain;differentiable plug-in estimator;gradient-based optimization technique;grid search;hyperparameter configuration;hyperparameter optimization;hyperparameter response function;knowledge transfer;meta-data set","","4","","26","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Large neural networks can be considered a universal function that can approximate any function, and hence are effective at learning from the training data, not only the useful information but also the noise in the training data. However, as the number of neurons and the number of hidden layers grow, the number of connections in the network increases exponentially, and the over fitting problem becomes more severe biased towards noise. Various methods have been proposed to address this problem such as AutoEncoder, Dropout, DropConnect, and Factored Mean training.

In this paper, we use convolutional neural network model to learn features from RGB-D dataset which are then given to a linear SVM classifier to classify objects. As the number of images in RGB-D dataset is not big enough to retrain a deep neural network with high feature extraction accuracy, we fine-tune the caffe model which was trained on approximately 1.2 million RGB images from ImageNet database.

Both have received a lot of attention in the context of classification. With the ever increasing growth of data, however, there is a high demand of compact and universal representations of data streams that enable the user to analyze current as well as historic data without having access to the raw data. To make a first step towards this direction, we propose a condensed representation that captures the various - possibly recurrent - data distributions of the stream by extending the notion of possible worlds. The representation enables queries concerning the whole stream and can, hence, serve as a tool for supporting decision-making processes or serve as a basis for implementing data mining and machine learning algorithms on top of it. We evaluate this condensed representation on synthetic and real-world data.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8273-1; POD:978-1-4673-8274-8","10.1109/DSAA.2015.7344814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344814","","Clocks;Context;Data mining;Data models;Itemsets;Machine learning algorithms;Shape","data mining;data structures;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence)","data mining;data representation;data streams;decision making process;machine learning;possible worlds;recurrent data distributions discovery;universal representations","","","","35","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is the first attempt on building such an algorithm for Sinhala. For this task we have implemented the Simplified Lesk algorithm with our own modifications under the two assumptions 'one sense per collocation' and 'one sense per discourse'. We define a window size around the target polysemous word and calculate the number of words in that window that overlap with each sense of the target polysemous word. Since there has not been many significant initiatives on natural language processing applications for Sinhala, critical resources such as functioning morphological analysis tools are not available, making accurate word sense disambiguation an even harder task.

Verification today takes as much as 70% of the design time with debugging being responsible for half of this effort. Automation has mitigated part of the resource-intensive nature of rectifying erroneous designs. Nevertheless, most tools target failures in isolation. Since regression verification can discover myriads of failures in one run, automation is also required to guide an engineer to rank them and expedite debugging. To address this growing regression pain, this paper presents a framework that utilizes traditional machine learning techniques along with historical data in version control systems and the results of functional debugging. Its aim is to rank revisions based on their likelihood of being responsible for a particular failure. Ranking prioritizes revisions that ought to be targeted first, and therefore it speeds-up the localization of the error source. This effectively reduces the number of debug iterations. Experiments on industrial designs demonstrate a 68% improvement in the ranking of actual erroneous revisions versus the ranking obtained through existing industrial methodologies. This benefit arrives with negligible run-time overhead.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7166-7; POD:978-1-4673-7167-4","10.1109/ICCD.2015.7357081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357081","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Control systems;Debugging;Force;Hardware design languages;Machine learning algorithms","configuration management;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;program debugging;program verification","clustering-based revision debugging;debug iterations;erroneous revisions;error source localization;functional debugging;machine learning techniques;modern digital systems;regression verification;revision ranking;version control systems","","1","","11","","","18-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigate to use two layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to encode different local descriptors with a novel group sparse learning (GSL) inspired by the recent success of sparse coding.

After that, each data sample receives a score based on its membership degrees in each dimension of the feature space. Majority samples with the highest scores are the best candidates of removal. Then during the Rotation Forest algorithm's train phase, a fuzzy Principal Component Analysis (F-PCA) is applied on the fuzzified values of samples which are produced in the undersampling phase.

Existing approaches to learning classifiers from RDF data in such a setting fail to take advantage of RDF schema (RDFS) associated with the data store that asserts subclass hierarchies which provide information that can potentially be exploited by the learner. Against this background, we present a general approach that augments an existing directed graphical model with hidden variables that encode subclass hierarchies via probabilistic constraints. We also present an algorithm ProbAVT that adopts the variational Bayesian expectation maximization approach to efficiently learn parameters in such settings. Our experiments with several synthetic and real world datasets show that: (i) ProbAVT matches or outperforms its counterpart that does not incorporate background knowledge in the form of subclass hierarchies; (ii) ProbAVT remains competitive compared to other state-of-art models that incorporate subclass hierarchies, and is able to scale up to large hierarchies consisting of over tens of thousands of nodes.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9926-2; POD:978-1-4799-9927-9","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363953","","Bayes methods;Big data;Data models;Graphical models;Machine learning algorithms;Predictive models;Resource description framework","Bayes methods;cloud computing;expectation-maximisation algorithm;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;query processing","LOD cloud;ProbAVT;RDFS subclass hierarchies;SPARQL;directed graphical model;learning classifiers;linked open data;machine learning algorithms;query interface;remote RDF data;variational Bayesian expectation maximization","","","","30","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This problem basically refers to the skewness in the data underlying distribution which, in turn, imposes many difficulties on typical machine learning algorithms. To deal with the emerging issues arising from multi-class skewed distributions, existing efforts are mainly divided into two categories: model-oriented solutions and data-oriented techniques. Focusing on the latter, this paper presents a new over-sampling technique which is inspired by Mahalanobis distance. The presented over-sampling technique, called MDO (Mahalanobis Distance-based Over-sampling technique), generates synthetic samples which have the same Mahalanobis distance from the considered class mean as other minority class examples. By preserving the covariance structure of the minority class instances and intelligently generating synthetic samples along the probability contours, new minority class instances are modelled better for learning algorithms. Moreover, MDO can reduce the risk of overlapping between different class regions which are considered as a serious challenge in multi-class problems. Our theoretical analyses and empirical observations across wide spectrum multi-class imbalanced benchmarks indicate that MDO is the method of choice by offering statistical superior MAUC and precision compared to the popular over-sampling techniques.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2458858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163639","Mahalanobis distance;Multi-class imbalance problems;over-sampling techniques","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Training","covariance analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);modelling;pattern classification;sampling methods;statistical distributions","MDO;Mahalanobis distance-based oversampling technique;covariance structure;data skewness;data-oriented technique;machine learning algorithm;minority class instance modelling;model-oriented solution;multiclass imbalanced problem;probability contour","","3","","57","","20150721","Jan. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The data-parallelism is achieved by uniformly distributing it using HBase tables with proper row keys. Performance evaluations are made by estimation of the speed-up of multi-node clusters against a one-node cluster. The framework was deployed on a on-premises Hadoop cluster. The results show that by parallelization and distribution of the computations on a cluster significant speedup can be achieved. The main contribution of this paper is that we have demonstrated how the higher level scripting language Pig Latin can be used for writing MapReduce jobs instead of directly writing a separate map and reduce function.

This model has been widely applied in numerous machine learning applications. A significant amount of effort has been made to increase the size of the deep learning model with respect to the size of the training dataset and the parameter of the model to improve performance. However, training a large deep learning model is highly time consuming. Recent studies have applied the CPU cluster with thousands of machines as well as the single GPU or the GPU cluster, to train large scale deep learning models. As a high-performance coprocessor like GPU, the Xeon Phi can be an alternative tool for training large scale deep learning models on a single machine. The Xeon Phi can be recognized as a small cluster which features about 60 cores, and each core supports four hardware threads. Massive parallelism offsets the low computing capacity of every core, but challenges an efficient parallel autoencoders design. In this paper, we analyze the training algorithm of autoen-coders based on the matrix operation and point out the thread oversubscription problem, which results in performance degradation. Based on the observation, we propose our map-reduce implementation of autoencoders on the Xeon Phi coprocessor. Our basic idea is to parallelize multiple autoencoder model replicas with bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) communication model where the parameters are updated after the computations of all replicas are completed. Each thread is responsible for one model replica, and all replicas work together on the same mini-batch. This data parallelism method is suitable for training autoencoders on the Xeon Phi, and can extend to asynchronous parallel training method without thread oversubscription. In our experiment the speedup is four times higher than that of sequential implementation. Enlarging the size of the autoencoder model, our method still gets stable speedup.","","CD:978-1-5090-0153-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363241","Autoencoder;BSP;Deep Learning;Map-reduce;Xeon Phi","Computational modeling;Coprocessors;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Machine learning;Parallel processing;Training","coprocessors;data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;parallel processing;pattern clustering","BSP communication model;CPU cluster;GPU cluster;Mapreduce method;Xeon Phi coprocessor;asynchronous parallel training method;autoencoder MapReduce implementation;autoencoder training;bulk synchronous parallel communication model;data parallelism method;hardware threads;high-performance coprocessor;large scale deep learning models;machine learning applications;matrix operation;stacked autoencoder;thread oversubscription;thread oversubscription problem","","","","24","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To process huge data set is a time consuming work, not only due to its big volume of data size, but also because data type and structure can be different and complex. Currently, many data mining and machine learning technique are being applied to deal with big data problem; some of them can construct a good learning algorithm in terms of lots of training example. However, considering the data dimension, it will be more efficient if learning algorithm is capable of selecting useful features or decreasing the feature dimension. Word2Vec, proposed and supported by Google, is not an individual algorithm, but it consists of two learning models, Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram.

To enable an effective and real-time monitoring, sensor data have to be treated and processed in an event processing manner. Complex Event Processing is an efficient technology that detects useful complex events by matching primitive sensor events using event patterns. Event patterns can be represented as templates that combine primitive events by temporal, logical, spatial and sequential correlations to detect more complex events. Identifying event patterns out of streaming data with a high data volume and velocity is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an Ensemble Model consisting of a crisp and fuzzy rule based classifiers in order to derive decision rules as event patterns. Before implementing the ensemble classifier directly to the streaming data, we select the most influential feature subset using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using real data obtained from accelerometer sensors.

In the symmetric case, the graph has two equally sized clusters and vertices connect with probability p within clusters and q across clusters. In the past two decades, a large body of literature in statistics and computer science has focused on providing lower bounds on the scaling of | p - q| to ensure exact recovery. In this paper, we identify a sharp threshold phenomenon for exact recovery: if Î± = pn/log(n) and Î² = qn/ log(n) are constant (with Î± > Î²), recovering the communities with high probability is possible if (Î± + Î²/2) - â(Î±Î²) > 1 and is impossible if (Î± + Î²/2) - â(Î±Î²) <; 1. In particular, this improves the existing bounds. This also sets a new line of sight for efficient clustering algorithms. While maximum likelihood (ML) achieves the optimal threshold (by definition), it is in the worst case NP-hard. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm based on a semidefinite programming relaxation of ML, which is proved to succeed in recovering the communities close to the threshold, while numerical experiments suggest that it may achieve the threshold. An efficient algorithm that succeeds all the way down to the threshold is also obtained using a partial recovery algorithm combined with a local improvement procedure.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2015.2490670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298436","Communities;clustering algorithms;detection algorithms;network theory (graphs);statistical learning","Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Computer science;Machine learning algorithms;Maximum likelihood decoding;Maximum likelihood estimation;Stochastic processes","mathematical programming;maximum likelihood estimation;network theory (graphs);probability","clustering algorithm;computer science;maximum likelihood;partial recovery algorithm;probability;semidefinite programming relaxation;stochastic block model","","14","","40","","20151014","Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With the help of our quantization method, not only 93.75% of the parameter memory size can be reduced by replacing the word length from 32-bit to 2-bit, but the testing accuracy after quantization is also better than previous approaches in some dataset, and the additional training overhead is only 3% of the ordinary one.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9604-2; POD:978-1-4673-9605-9; USB:978-1-4673-9603-5","10.1109/SiPS.2015.7345005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345005","Convolutional Network;Deep Learning;Deep Neural Network;Quantize;Regularize","Computational modeling;Graphics processing units;Machine learning;Memory management;Neural networks;Quantization (signal);Training","convolution;embedded systems;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);quantisation (signal)","deep convolutional network;deep learning;image classification;network quantization;physical world embedded system","","1","","27","","","14-16 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method contains two major modules: the spectral classification module and the spatial constraint module. Spectral classification module uses a deep network named stacked denoising autoencoders (SdA) to learn feature representation of the data. Through SdA, the data are projected nonlinearly from its original hyperspectral space to some higher dimensional space where more compact distribution is obtained. An interesting aspect of this method is that it does not need a feature design/extraction process guided by human prior. The suitable feature for the classification is learned by the deep network itself. Superpixel is utilized to generate the spatial constraints to refine the spectral classification results. By exploiting the spatial consistency of neighborhood pixels, the accuracy of classification is further improved by a big margin.

Experimental results show that the glasses detection rate is highly satisfactory for various face databases. Secondly, based on the landmarks on glasses, we apply the non-local colour total variation (CTV) inpainting approach in an attempt to remove the glasses; also, we apply the deep learning technique to further remove the traces of glasses and light reflection on lenses by regarding them as noises.

Especially, as the development of the social media, there is a big need in dig meaningful information from the big data on Internet through the sentiment analysis. Inspired by the successes of deep learning, we are interested in handling the sentiment analysis task using deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a framework called Word2vec + Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Firstly, we use the word2vec proposed by Google to compute vector representations of words, which will be the input for the CNN. The purpose of using word2vec is to gain the vector representation of word and reflect the distance of words. That will lead to initialize the parameters at a good point of CNN, which can efficiently improve the performance of the nets in this problem. Secondly, we design a suitable CNN architecture for the sentiment analysis task. We use 3 pairs of convolutional layers and pooling layers in this architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a 7-layers architecture model is applied using word2vec and CNN to analyze sentences' sentiment. We also use the Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU), Normalization and Dropout technology to improve the accuracy and generalizability of our model. We test our framework in a public dataset which is the corpus of movie review excerpts that includes fives labels: negative, somewhat negative, neural, somewhat positive and positive. Our network achieves test accuracy of 45.4% in this dataset, which is a better performance than some other neural network model like Recursive Neural Network (RNN) and Matrix-Vector Recursive Neural Network (MV-RNN).","","CD:978-1-5090-0153-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363395","deep learning;sentiment analysis;word2vec","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Google;Machine learning;Media;Neural networks;Sentiment analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;sentiment analysis","7-layers architecture model;Big Data;CNN architecture;Internet;MV-RNN;PReLU;RNN;Word2vec framework;convolutional layers;convolutional neural network;deep learning models;matrix-vector recursive neural network;natural language processing tasks;normalization and dropout technology;parametric rectified linear unit;pooling layers;recursive neural network;sentence sentiment analysis;social media;text content sentiment analysis;word vector representation","","","","21","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a big-data processing framework is introduced to analyse the transportation data, particularly taking the classification problem of the parking occupation status as an illustrative example. Three modules are implemented to crawl the raw records, generate high-level features, and apply the machine learning algorithm for classification. In addition, the fuzzification algorithm is also introduced to quantify the key attributes of the data, which helps in removing the data redundancy and inconsistency.

Therefore, based on a uni-modality distribution assumption, many researchers have proposed virtual sample generation methods to expand the training sample size to enhance the performance of small data set learning. In practice, small data may be following a multi-modality distribution. Therefore, in order to solve multi-modal small data sets, this study proposes a new approach to create multi-modality Weibull virtual samples, where we use the maximal p-value to estimate parameters of the Weibull distribution. In addition, the soft DBSCAN method is used to identify a suitable number of modalities. One data set is employed to check the performance of the proposed method, and comparisons are made by the prediction on root mean square error.

The architecture is composed of 5 layers and is designed in a way that allows it to learn numbers from one to ten by associating the sensory inputs (motor and auditory) coming from the iCub humanoid robotic platform. The architecture performance is validated and tested in two developmental experiments. In the first experiment, standard backpropagation is compared with a deep learning approach, in which weights and biases are pre-trained by means of a greedy algorithm and then refined with backpropagation. In the second experiment, six bi-cultural number learning conditions are compared to explore the impact of different languages (for number words) and finger counting strategies.

Many researchers tried to apply Deep Belief Network (DBN) to learn new representations of the audio. The mel filter-bank feature, which is obtained based on mel scale, is commonly used as the low level representation of the audio in the pre-processing procedure of DBN. However, the mel bands used in mel filter-bank feature may not be sufficient for the comprehensive representation of the diverse audio events in the real world and then it will make it difficult for DBN to learn good audio features. In this paper, two steps are taken to explore and tackle the problem. In the first step, we conduct a comparison of the effects among different arrangements of frequency bands to DBN feature learning in the audio event recognition. Here the arrangements of frequency bands include mel bands, bark bands, linear bands and pyramid bands. In the second step, in order to utilize the different classification capabilities of the DBN features on different audio events, we adopt the Adaboost algorithm to fuse them. We conduct the experiments on real datasets collected from findsound website, and the results verifies that our proposed audio event classification system, which uses diverse features selected by Adaboost from all sets of DBN features, outperforms the one using only one kind of DBN feature set.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7478-1; POD:978-1-4673-7479-8","10.1109/MMSP.2015.7340807","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340807","","Event detection;Feature extraction;Fuses;Machine learning;Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Training","audio signal processing;belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);signal classification","Adaboost algorithm;DBN features;audio event classification;audio event classification system;audio event recognition;bark bands;deep belief network;linear bands;mel bands;mel filter-bank feature;multiple filter-bank representations;pyramid bands","","","","","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given only a bounding box localization of the foreground objects, our approach automatically transforms the input images into a roughly-aligned pose space and discovers the most discriminative visual fragments for each category. These fragments are then used to learn robust classifiers that discriminate between very similar categories under challenging conditions such as large variations in pose or habitats. The minimal required input, is a critical characteristic that enables our approach to generalize over visual domains where expert knowledge is not readily available. Moreover, our approach takes advantage of deep networks that are targeted towards fine-grained classification. It learns mid-level representations that are specific to a category and generalize well across the category instances at the same time. Our evaluations demonstrate that the automatically learned representation based on discriminative fragments, significantly outperforms globally extracted deep features in classification accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8339-1; POD:978-1-4799-8340-7","10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7351466","Fine-grained;classification;deep learning;mid-level representation","Birds;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Robustness;Training;Visualization;Yttrium","data mining;feature extraction;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","bounding box localization;classification accuracy;deep networks;discriminative visual element mining;discriminative visual fragments;feature extraction;fine-grained classification;fine-grained fragment discovery;foreground objects;mid-level representations;robust classifiers;roughly-aligned pose space;visual domains","","","","25","","","27-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Diagnosis of labour in normal pregnancies is important for minimizing unnecessary hospitalisations, interventions and expenses. Moreover, accurate identification of spontaneous preterm labour would also allow clinicians to start necessary treatments early in women with true labour and avert unnecessary treatment and hospitalisation for women who are simply having preterm contractions, but who are not in true labour. In this research, the Electrohysterography signals have been used to detect preterm births, because Electrohysterography signals provide a strong basis for objective prediction and diagnosis of preterm birth. This has been achieved using an open dataset, which contains 262 records for women who delivered at term and 38 who delivered prematurely. Three different machine learning algorithm were used to identify these records.

The energy efficiency issue in the sensor node is a big challenge in the entire system. Compressive sensing (CS) provides a potential way to tackle this problem. However, the overhead of signal reconstruction constrains the compression in sensor node and analysis in remote server. In this paper, we design a new selective CS architecture for wireless implantable neural decoding. We implement all the signal analysis on the compressed domain. To achieve better energy efficiency, we propose a two-stage classification procedure, including a coarse-grained screening module with softmax regression and a fine-grained analysis module based on deep learning. The screening module completes the low-effort classification task in the front-end and transmits the compressed data of high-effort task to remote server for fine-grained analysis.

This effectively reduces the feature space, and thus the complexity of classifiers. Though several algorithms have been proposed, no single one outperforms all the other in all scenarios, and the problem is still an actively researched field. This paper proposes a new hybrid parallel approach to perform feature selection. The idea is to use a filter metric to reduce feature space, and then use an innovative wrapper method to search extensively for the best solution. The proposed strategy is implemented on a shared memory parallel environment to speedup the process. We evaluated its parallel performance using up to 32 cores and our results show 30 times gain in speed.

With cheap storage, instead of storing only currently relevant data, it is common to store as much data as possible, hoping that its value can be extracted later. In this way, exabytes (1018 bytes) of data are being created on a daily basis. Extracting value from these data, however, requires scalable implementations of advanced analytical algorithms beyond simple data processing, e.g., statistical regression methods, linear algebra, and optimization algorithms. Most such traditional methods are designed to minimize floating-point operations, which is the dominant cost of in-memory computation on a single machine. In parallel and distributed environments, however, load balancing and communication, including disk and network input/output (I/O), can easily dominate computation. These factors greatly increase the complexity of algorithm design and challenge traditional ways of thinking about the design of parallel and distributed algorithms. Here, we review recent work on developing and implementing randomized matrix algorithms in large-scale parallel and distributed environments.

However, the vehicle speed that a given driver chooses will vary from driver to driver and from time to time, and may be slower, equal to, or faster than the average traffic flow. If the specific driver speed profile can be predicted, the energy usage can be optimized across the route chosen.

Moreover, the values of the features and/or labels of the datasets might be nonnumeric and involve vague values. Traditional learning-based prediction and classification methods cannot handle these two issues. In this study, we propose a multistep fuzzy bridged refinement domain adaptation algorithm, which offers an effective way to deal with both issues. It utilizes a concept of similarity to modify the labels of the target instances that were initially predicted by a shift-unaware model. It then refines the labels using instances that are most similar to a given target instance. These instances are extracted from mixture domains composed of source and target domains. The proposed algorithm is built on a basis of some data and refines the labels, thus performing completely independently of the shift-unaware prediction model. The algorithm uses a fuzzy set-based approach to deal with the vague values of the features and labels. Four different datasets are used in the experiments to validate the proposed algorithm.

This paper proposes to introduce the strength of deep learning in the context of emotion prediction in videos. The two main contributions are as follow: (i) a new dataset, composed of 30 movies under Creative Commons licenses, continuously annotated along the induced valence and arousal axes (publicly available) is introduced, for which (ii) the performance of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) through supervised fine-tuning, the Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR) and the combination of both (Transfer Learning) are computed and discussed. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first approach in the literature using CNNs to predict dimensional affective scores from videos.

While numerous research groups have addressed the training of CNNs using GPUs, so far not much attention has been paid to the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor. In this paper we investigate empirically and theoretically the potential of the Intel Xeon Phi for supervised learning of CNNs. We design and implement a parallelization scheme named CHAOS that exploits both the thread-and SIMD-parallelism of the coprocessor. Our approach is evaluated on the Intel Xeon Phi 7120P using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits for various thread counts and CNN architectures. Results show a 103.5x speed up when training our large network for 15 epochs using 244 threads, compared to one thread on the coprocessor.

One promising nonparametric approach for this problem is trajectory transfer, in which a non-rigid registration is computed between the starting scene of the demonstration and the scene at test time. This registration is extrapolated to find a function from â<sup>3</sup> to â<sup>3</sup>, which is then used to warp the demonstrated robot trajectory to generate a proposed trajectory to execute in the test scene. In prior work [1] [2], only depth information from the scenes has been used to compute this warp function. This approach ignores appearance information, but there are situations in which using both shape and appearance information is necessary for finding high quality non-rigid warp functions. In this paper, we describe an approach to learn relevant appearance information about deformable objects using deep learning, and use this additional information to improve the quality of non-rigid registration between demonstration and test scenes. Our method better registers areas of interest on deformable objects that are crucial for manipulation, such as rope crossings and towel corners and edges. We experimentally validate our approach in both simulation and in the real world, and show that the utilization of appearance information leads to a significant improvement in both selecting the best matching demonstration scene for a given test scene, and finding a high quality non-rigid registration between those two scenes.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9994-1; POD:978-1-4799-9995-8; USB:978-1-4799-9993-4","10.1109/IROS.2015.7353475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7353475","","Context;Machine learning;Neural networks;Robots;Shape;Three-dimensional displays;Trajectory","extrapolation;image registration;robot vision;trajectory control","appearance prior;deep learning;deformable object manipulation;nonparametric approach;nonrigid registration;robotics;trajectory transfer;warp function","","2","","38","","","Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extracting useful patterns from massive collection of objects requires not only accurate, but also fast algorithms with limited computational complexity. However, one should remember that the problem with massive datasets lies not only in their volume. There is a number of difficulties embedded in the nature of data, that must be properly addressed in order to design an efficient learning system. In this paper we address multiple problems related to big data analytics. We assume the streaming nature of our data. Additionally, we work in non-stationary environment where nature of data may constantly change. Finally, we consider a situation where not object from one class are only available what leads us to the one-class classification task. We propose a novel incremental ensemble of weighted one-class classifiers, based on boosting. Our learners adapt to evolving nature of data stream by changing weights assigned to objects and forgetting outdated examples. The proposed bagging scheme allows for diversifying the pool of individual classifiers which can run in a distributed computing environment. We propose to maintain the diversity of the ensemble by updating each classifier with a bootstrap sample from incoming stream. Experimental study proves the usefulness of our approach in scenarios, where we need to process massive and evolving data streams without the access to counterexamples.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7952-6; POD:978-1-4673-7953-3","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345495","big data;classifier ensemble;concept drift;data streams;incremental learning;one-class classification","Bagging;Big data;Data mining;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Training","Big Data;data analysis;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","Big Data analytics;Big Data streaming;distributed computing environment;machine learning system;one-class classification task","","","","21","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without it, the computation cost of big data analytics can become unmanageable and spurious correlations and noise can reduce the accuracy of any results. Feature selection removes irrelevant and redundant information leading to faster, more reliable data analysis. Feature selection techniques based on information theory are among the fastest known and the Manchester AnalyticS Toolkit (MAST) provides an efficient, parallel and scalable implementation of these methods. This paper considers a number of data structures for storing the frequency counters that underpin MAST. We show that preprocessing the data to reduce the number of zero-valued counters in an array structure results in an order of magnitude reduction in both memory usage and execution time compared to state of the art structures that use explicit mappings to avoid zero-valued counters. We also describe a number of parallel processing techniques that enable MAST to scale linearly with the number of processors even on NUMA architectures. MAST targets scale-up servers rather than scale-out clusters and we show that it performs orders of magnitude faster than existing tools. Moreover, we show that MAST is 3.5 times faster than a scale-out solution built for Spark running on the same server. As an example of the performance of MAST, we were able to process a dataset of 100 million examples and 100,000 features in under 10 minutes on a four socket server which each socket containing an 8-core Intel Xeon E5-4620 processor.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9926-2; POD:978-1-4799-9927-9","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363774","Big Data;Data Analytics;Data Structures;Feature Selection;Information Theory;Mutual Information;Parallel Processing","Arrays;Big data;Machine learning algorithms;Mutual information;Radiation detectors;Servers","Big Data;data analysis;data structures;feature selection;information theory;parallel processing","8-core Intel Xeon E5-4620 processor;Big Data analytics;MAST;Manchester analytics toolkit;NUMA architectures;Spark;data analytics tool;data preprocessing;data structures;frequency counters;high dimensional data;information theoretic feature selection;machine learning;magnitude reduction;memory execution time;memory usage;noise reduction;parallel processing techniques;scale-out clusters;socket server;zero-valued counters","","","","22","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, related research with adequate subjects and large age gaps is surprisingly rare. In this work, we first collect a so-called cross-age face (CAFE) dataset, ranging from child, to young, to adult, to old groups. Then, we propose a novel framework, called deep aging face verification (DAFV), for this challenging task. DAFV includes two modules: aging pattern synthesis and aging face verification. The aging pattern synthesis module synthesizes the faces of all age groups for the input face of an arbitrary age, and the core structure is a deep aging-aware denoising auto-encoder ( a<sup>2</sup>-DAE) with multiple outputs. The aging face verification module then takes the synthesized aging patterns of a face pair as the input, and each pair of synthesized images of the same age group is fed into a parallel CNN; finally, all parallel CNN outputs are fused to provide similar/dissimilar prediction. For DAFV, the training of the aging face verification module easily suffers from the overfitting results from the aging pattern synthesis module, and we propose to use the cross- validation strategy to produce error-aware outputs for the synthesis module. Extensive experiments on the CAFE dataset well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DAFV framework over other solutions for aging face verification.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2015.2500730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328752","Cross-age;deep learning;face verification","Aging;Face;Face recognition;Image reconstruction;Machine learning;Testing;Training","face recognition;image denoising;neural nets","CAFE dataset;DAFV;aging pattern synthesis module;cross-age face dataset;cross-validation strategy;deep aging face verification;deep aging-aware denoising auto-encoder;face recognition;parallel CNN;social networks;user recognition","","2","","38","","20151113","Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In particular, we investigate whether incongruent expressions are perceived as 1) regulated, and 2) unsuccessful in terms of animation synthesis. For this purpose, we conducted a perceptive study with the use of a virtual agent. Congruent and incongruent multimodal expressions of laughter were synthesized from natural audiovisual laughter episodes, using machine learning algorithms. Next, the intensity of facial expressions and body movements were systematically manipulated to check whether the resulting incongruent expressions are perceived differently compared to the corresponding congruent expressions. Results show that 1) intensity incongruence lowers the perception of believability and plausibility, and 2) the in-congruent laughter expressions displaying high intensity in the audio modality and low intensity in the body movement and facial expression are perceived as more fake than the corresponding congruent expressions. Such results have implications for both animation synthesis as well as expression regulation research.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9953-8; POD:978-1-4799-9954-5; USB:978-1-4799-9952-1","10.1109/ACII.2015.7344643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344643","incongruence;laughter;multimodal expressions;virtual agents","Animation;Context;Electronic mail;Face;Machine learning algorithms;Torso;Visualization","computer animation;emotion recognition;face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;psychology;visual perception","animation synthesis;auditory modality;body movement;expression regulation;facial expression;intensity incongruence perception;laughter multimodal expression;machine learning algorithm;virtual agent;visual modality","","","","25","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We survey the most important results concerning this issue and we study the problem from the point of view of some alternative models of automata. The preliminary results concerning the last issue motivate us to formulate a conjecture stating that DFAs can separate any pair of strings by using a logarithmic number of states.

In this keynote, we discuss the limitations of current machine learning and data mining algorithms. We discuss the fundamental issues in learning in dynamic environments like learning decision models that evolve over time, learning and forgetting, concept drift and change detection. Data streams are characterized by huge amounts of data that introduce new constraints in the design of learning algorithms: limited computational resources in terms of memory, processing time and CPU power. In this talk, we present some illustrative algorithms designed to taking these constrains into account. We identify the main issues and current challenges that emerge in learning from data streams, and present open research lines for further developments.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6698-4; POD:978-1-4673-6699-1; USB:978-1-4673-6697-7","10.1109/EAIS.2015.7368772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368772","","Adaptive systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Change detection algorithms;Conferences;Data mining;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning algorithms","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence)","CPU power;change detection;computational resources;dynamic environments;keynote speaker;learning algorithms;learning decision models;machine learning;open research lines;real time data mining algorithms;transient data streams","","","","","","","1-3 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is intriguing and important to understand what emotions are conveyed and how they are implied by the visual content of images. Inspired by the recent success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in visual recognition, we explore two simple, yet effective deep learning-based methods for image emotion analysis. The first method uses off-the-shelf CNN features directly for classification. For the second method, we fine-tune a CNN that is pre-trained on a large dataset, i.e. ImageNet, on our target dataset first. Then we extract features using the fine-tuned CNN at different location at multiple levels to capture both the global and local information. The features at different location are aggregated using the Fisher Vector for each level and concatenated to form a compact representation. From our experimental results, both the deep learning-based methods outperforms traditional methods based on generic image descriptors and hand-crafted features.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8339-1; POD:978-1-4799-8340-7","10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7351656","Image emotion;convolutional neural network;deep learning;image classification","Feature extraction;Image recognition;Machine learning;Neural networks;Support vector machines;Training;Visualization","emotion recognition;feature extraction;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;vectors","Fisher vector;compact representation;deep convolutional neural networks;deep feature learning;feature extraction;image emotion classification;off-the-shelf CNN features;visual recognition","","1","","18","","","27-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, a common paradigm is to compare the input face with reference faces of known age to generate a ranking relation whereby the first-rank reference is exploited for labeling the input face. In this paper, we proposed a framework to improve upon the typical ranking model, called Voting system on Ranking model (VRank), by leveraging relational information (comparative relations, i.e. if the input face is younger or older than each of the references) to make a more robust estimation. Our approach has several advantages: firstly, comparative relations can be explicitly involved to benefit the estimation task; secondly, few incorrect comparisons will not influence much the accuracy of the result, making this approach more robust than the conventional approach; finally, we propose to incorporate the deep learning architecture for training, which extracts robust facial features for increasing the effectiveness of classification. In comparison to the best results from the state-of-the-art methods, the VRank showed a significant outperformance on all the benchmarks, with a relative improvement of 5.74% ~ 69.45% (FG-NET), 19.09% ~ 68.71% (MORPH), and 0.55% ~ 17.73% (IoG).","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7478-1; POD:978-1-4673-7479-8","10.1109/MMSP.2015.7340789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340789","","Bismuth;Estimation;Face;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Robustness;Support vector machines","estimation theory;feature extraction","VRank;deep learning architecture;estimation task;first-rank reference;human age estimation;ranking model;relational information;robust estimation;robust facial features;voting system","","","","30","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The major components of reliable HADS includes enriched data source (DS), computational efficient data feature retrieval (DFR), accurate and fast decision engine (DE). ADFA-LD is a recently published data set which reflects the invisible threat environment of modern computer system. The existing HADS utilizing ADFA-LD as DS, exhibits high computational DFR and inferior performance of the DE at real-time. The major drawback is inability to acquire representative features from host activities. Confronting this drawback in this paper, at DFR a character data zero watermark inspired statistical based strategy is developed for integer data to extract hidden reliable or representative features from system calls of the trace. At DE, three supervised machine learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) with linear and radial bases function (RBF) kernels and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) are evaluated across detection rate (DR), false alarm rate (FAR) and computational time. The numerical trials validates that the suggested statistical feature extraction strategy at DFR and KNN at DE can attain acceptable performance at real-time.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8389-6; POD:978-1-4799-8467-1; USB:978-1-4673-7317-3","10.1109/ICIEA.2015.7334166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7334166","Host based intrusion detection systems (HIDS);Low foot print attacks;System calls;Zero-day attacks","Feature extraction;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Reliability;Support vector machines;Training;Watermarking","computer network security;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);mechanical engineering computing;pattern classification;statistical analysis","DFR;HADS;KNN;computer system;cyber attack;data feature retrieval;data source;decision engine;host-based anomaly detection system;statistical based strategy;statistical feature extraction strategy;supervised machine learning classifier","","","","32","","","15-17 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
