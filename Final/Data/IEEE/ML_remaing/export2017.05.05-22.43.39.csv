The selection of relevant features is an important part of the preprocessing step in pattern recognition, statistics, knowledge discovery and data mining. Discovering attributes with little or without predictive information allows overfitting avoidance and comprehensibility improvement of the resulting model. In the literature, there are several measures to estimate the quality of the attributes. This paper proposes a predictability-based feature selection technique, in concert with a fuzzy inference system, to point out the potential variables in predictive modeling. The same as Relief family methods, this approach takes into account the context of other attributes, given the target value, to assess the predictability of attributes according to how well their values distinguish between instances that are near each other. Using Bayesian decision theory and fuzzy rules, the system provides, for each feature, its relevancy, as qualitative information and its predictability score as quantitative measure. Encouraging first results presented in two case studies conclude this paper, bringing experimental evidence to support our proposal. However, theoretical and experimental investigations must continue until better feature selection strategies will emerge. Our work is just another step toward this goal.","","Electronic:978-606-834-846-9; POD:978-1-4673-4534-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379301","","Context;Filtering theory;Fuzzy logic;Iris;Machine learning;Predictive models;Training","Bayes methods;data mining;decision theory;fuzzy reasoning","Bayesian decision theory;attribute discovery;attribute quality estimation;fuzzy inference system;fuzzy rules;predictability score-based feature selection;predictive data mining;qualitative information;quantitative information;relief family methods;soft computing methods;target value","","0","","11","","","12-14 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cost-sensitive learning is viewed as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem, leading to a novel cost-sensitive decision tree algorithm.

In fact, complexity of multi-classifiers systems make the theoretical evaluation of system performance very difficult and, consequently, also the design of a multi-classifier system. This paper presents a new approach for the design of a multi-classifier system. In particular, the problem of feature selection for a multi-classifier system is addressed and a genetic algorithm is proposed for automatic selecting the optimal set of features for each individual classifier of the multi-classifier system.

Therefore, other proposed schemes which aim at ether LIPA at H(e)NB or SIPTO at macro network could not get high accuracy and high speed at the same time, and traffic classification methodologies in wired IP network are not applicable.

Second, the statistical properties of this test are analytically calculated; it is particularly shown that the decision threshold which warrants a given probability of false-alarm is independent of inspected medium parameters. This provides an asymptotic upper-bound for the detection power of any test that aims at detecting data hidden with the LSB matching method. In practice, when detecting LSB matching, the unknown medium parameters have to be estimated. Based on a local model of digital media, a generalized likelihood ratio test is presented by replacing the unknown parameters by their estimation.

A variety of hashing methods have been developed, but most of them resort to a single view (representation) of data. However, objects are often described by multiple representations. For instance, images are described by a few different visual descriptors (such as SIFT, GIST, and HOG), so it is desirable to incorporate multiple representations into hashing, leading to multi-view hashing. In this paper we present a deep network for multi-view hashing, referred to as deep multi-view hashing, where each layer of hidden nodes is composed of view-specific and shared hidden nodes, in order to learn individual and shared hidden spaces from multiple views of data. Numerical experiments on image datasets demonstrate the useful behavior of our deep multi-view hashing (DMVH), compared to recently-proposed multi-modal deep network as well as existing shallow models of hashing.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-0-7695-4905-7; POD:978-1-4673-4649-8","10.1109/ICDM.2012.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6413830","deep learning;harmonium;hashing;multi-view learning;restricted Boltzmann machines","Binary codes;Computational modeling;Hamming distance;Linear programming;Machine learning;Training;Visualization","cryptography;image coding;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence)","Hamming distance;binary code;data single view representation;deep learning;hashing method;high-dimensional object;image dataset;multiple representation;multiview hashing;shared hidden node;similarity-preserving low-dimensional Hamming space;view-specific hidden node;visual descriptor","","8","","22","","","10-13 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although machine learning offers algorithms for finding patterns in data automatically, they often require algorithm-specific parameters, such as an appropriate distance function, which are outside the purview of a domain expert. We present a system that allows an expert to interact directly with a visual representation of the data to define an appropriate distance function, thus avoiding direct manipulation of obtuse model parameters. Adopting an iterative approach, our system first assumes a uniformly weighted Euclidean distance function and projects the data into a two-dimensional scatterplot view. The user can then move incorrectly-positioned data points to locations that reflect his or her understanding of the similarity of those data points relative to the other data points. Based on this input, the system performs an optimization to learn a new distance function and then re-projects the data to redraw the scatter-plot. We illustrate empirically that with only a few iterations of interaction and optimization, a user can achieve a scatterplot view and its corresponding distance function that reflect the user's knowledge of the data. In addition, we evaluate our system to assess scalability in data size and data dimension, and show that our system is computationally efficient and can provide an interactive or near-interactive user experience.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4753-2; POD:978-1-4673-4752-5","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400486","","Bars;Data visualization;Euclidean distance;Machine learning;Vectors;Yttrium","data analysis;data visualisation;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","classification;data visual representation;dis-function;iterative approach;machine learning;optimization;two-dimensional scatterplot view;uniformly weighted Euclidean distance function","","29","","40","","","14-19 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To protect legitimate traders from becoming victims of internet fraud, it is important to identify camouflaged fraudsters as early as possible. Users need an effective but efficient early fraud detection system to assist in making final trading decisions. To this end, a series of cost-effective measures are developed in this study. First, principal component analysis is applied to reduce the dimensionality of attributes set for describing the features of traders. In general, fewer attributes being applied implies less computation efforts. Afterwards, a late-profiling method is proposed to characterize fraudsters by behavior occurred in their last phase. By curtailing the transaction histories appropriately, the overall detection cost can be greatly reduced while retaining reasonable detection accuracy. Based on the above measures, a cost-effective procedure is then devised to perform lazy-downloading detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, real transaction data is collected from Yahoo!Taiwan for testing. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the late-profiling models built with the reduced attributes can be ranged from 91% to 95%. That is almost similar to the results of applying expensive detection methods in the previous research. In addition, while only part of transaction histories is available, the proposed methods can still maintain a high accuracy over 90%. For measured attribute set reduction, experimental results also show the principal components analysis is actually helpful in generating a concise but effective attribute set. In conclusion, the effectiveness of our work is clearly demonstrated by the experimental results.","2157-0981;21570981","Electronic:978-1-4673-2317-8; POD:978-1-4673-2316-1","10.1109/ICTKE.2012.6408551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408551","classification;clustering;e-commerce;fraud detection;online auction","Accuracy;Atmospheric measurements;Data models;History;Machine learning algorithms;Particle measurements;Principal component analysis","electronic commerce;principal component analysis;security of data","Internet crime complaint;Yahoo!

From the perspective of machine learning, image classification task fits the multi-instance learning (MIL) framework very well owing to the fact that a specific keyword is often relevant to an object in an image rather than the entire image. In this paper, we propose a novel MIL algorithm to address image classification task. First, a new instance prototype extraction method is proposed to construct projection space for each keyword. Then, each training sample is mapped to this potential projection space as a point, which converts the MIL problem into standard supervised learning problem. Finally, an SVM is trained for each keyword.

The current study is designed to present the architecture of question classification (QC) in Persian based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) machine learning model and evaluate effects of various features on its accuracy. In this study, sentences were classified into two levels of coarse and fine classes based on the type of the answer to each question. After extracting features and setting sliding window on the CRF model, CRF question classifier (QC) is train. Then, the QC predicts labels for every token in question. Next, a majority voting on the question classification output, is used to extract a unique label for each question. Further, the effects of different features on the ultimate accuracy of the system were evaluated.

Secondly we need to classify it by evaluating which class leads to the minimum representation error. The dimension of imagery data is typically very high and that makes it computationally costly to process high-resolution images. It is widely believed that the - norm sparsity[4] constraint on coding coefficients plays a key role in the success of SRC. The theory of compressed sensing(CS) offers an useful method to reduce the face dimension. The basic principles of CS can reduce much lower-dimensional measurements of the images, without significantly compromising recognition performance.

For instance, each image in a multitemporal classification setting could be taken as an individual task. Here, the relation to previous acquisitions should be properly considered because of the nonstationary behavior of temporal, spatial, and angular image features which gives rise to distribution changes. This phenomenon is known as covariate shift. Additionally, when labeled data are scarce or expensive to obtain, the small sample-set problem arises, which makes solving the problems independently in each domain difficult. Multitask learning (MTL) aims at jointly solving a set of prediction problems by sharing information across tasks. This paper introduces MTL in remote sensing data classification. The proposed methods alleviate the data set shift by imposing cross-information in the classifiers through matrix regularization. We consider the support vector machine (SVM) as the core learner and two different regularization schemes: 1) the inclusion of relational operators between tasks and 2) the pairwise Euclidean distance of the predictors in the Hilbert space. These methods rely on simple and intuitive modifications of the kernel used in the standard SVM. Experiments are conducted in three challenging remote sensing problems: cloud screening from multispectral images, land-mine detection using radar data, and multitemporal and multisource image classification. The pairwise method consistently outperforms standard independent and aggregate approaches by about +2% to 4% in all problems at no additional cost. Also, the solutions found give us information about the distribution shift among tasks.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2200043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6214595","Cloud screening;covariate shift (CS);data set bias;domain adaptation;image classification;land-mine detection;multitask learning (MTL);support vector machine (SVM);urban monitoring","Aggregates;Kernel;Machine learning;Remote sensing;Standards;Support vector machines;Training","geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;remote sensing;support vector machines","Hilbert space pairwise predictor Euclidean distance;MTL;SVM;angular image features;cloud screening;covariate shift;cross information;data processing problems;image feature nonstationary behavior;land mine detection;matrix regularization;multisource image classification;multispectral images;multitask learning;multitask remote sensing data classification;multitemporal classification;multitemporal image classification;radar data;regularization schemes;relational operators;small sample set problem;spatial image features;support vector machine;temporal image features","","11","","33","","20120608","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed method is a location fingerprint scheme which employs the statistical characteristics of the signal cross-correlation among multiple sensors. As the cross-correlation between a pair of antennas fully stores the information of their complex channel responses, the proposed method can be considered as a generalized scheme of all conventional location fingerprint ones i.e. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), and Direction of Arrival (DOA). Besides, different from the conventional methods, in which the locality of spatial correlation is utilized, thus fine grid location measurements is required and environment must be static, the proposed one invokes statistical learning technique and estimates location based on the correlation of received samples with the statistical learning database. Therefore, the proposed method is superior to conventional ones in terms of location estimation accuracy and installation simplicity. An experiment conducted in class room validates the superiority of the proposed method.","Pending","Electronic:978-1-4673-2054-2; POD:978-1-4673-2052-8","10.1109/ICCS.2012.6406113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406113","","Antennas;Estimation;Indoor environments;Machine learning;Sensors;Vectors;Wireless sensor networks","cellular radio;indoor communication;mobility management (mobile radio);sensor fusion;statistical analysis","RSSI;TDOA;antenna;complex channel response;direction of arrival;grid location measurement;illegal cell-phone use;location fingerprint scheme;multisensor location estimation;real-life indoor environment;received signal strength indicator;signal cross-correlation;spatial correlation;statistical characteristics;statistical learning database;time difference of arrival","","1","","14","","","21-23 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new reconstruction rule for the One-per-Class (OpC) decomposition method that, distinguishing between safe and dangerous classifications using sample classification reliability, compensates class imbalance in multiclass recognition problems and reduces effects due to the skewness between classes.

In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for discriminative feature extraction for motor imagery classification in an EEG-based BCI in which the class-discriminative frequency bands and the corresponding spatial filters are optimized by means of the probabilistic and information-theoretic approaches. In our framework, the problem of simultaneous spatiospectral filter optimization is formulated as the estimation of an unknown posterior probability density function (pdf) that represents the probability that a single-trial EEG of predefined mental tasks can be discriminated in a state. In order to estimate the posterior pdf, we propose a particle-based approximation method by extending a factored-sampling technique with a diffusion process. An information-theoretic observation model is also devised to measure discriminative power of features between classes. From the viewpoint of classifier design, the proposed method naturally allows us to construct a spectrally weighted label decision rule by linearly combining the outputs from multiple classifiers. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method by analyzing the results and its success on three public databases.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6175024","Brain-Computer Interface (BCI);Discriminative feature extraction;ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG);motor imagery classification;spatiospectral filter optimization","Brain computer interfaces;Electroencephalography;Estimation;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Optimization;Probability density function","Bayes methods;approximation theory;brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;feature extraction;information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;sampling methods;signal classification;spatial filters","Bayesian framework;EEG-based BCI;brain-computer interfaces;class-discriminative frequency bands;classifier design;diffusion process;discriminative feature extraction;factored-sampling technique;information-theoretic approach;information-theoretic observation model;machine learning;mental tasks;motor imagery classification;particle-based approximation method;pdf;posterior probability density function;probabilistic approach;spatial filters;spatiospectral filter optimization;spectrally weighted label decision rule","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Discriminant Analysis;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Motor Cortex;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","58","","45","","20120403","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the information society is not only confronted with an information flood but also with an increase in ""information volatility"", by which we understand the fact that kind and distribution of a data source's emissions can significantly vary. In this paper we show how to estimate the expected effectiveness of a classification solution when the underlying data source undergoes a shift in the distribution of its subclasses (modes). Subclass distribution shifts are observed among others in online media such as tweets, blogs, or news articles, where document emissions follow topic popularity. To estimate the expected effectiveness of a classification solution we partition a test sample by means of clustering. Then, using repetitive resampling with different margin distributions over the clustering, the effectiveness characteristics is studied. We show that the effectiveness is normally distributed and introduce a probabilistic lower bound that is used for model selection. We analyze the relation between our notion of expected effectiveness and the mean effectiveness over the clustering both theoretically and on standard text corpora. An important result is a heuristic for expected effectiveness estimation that is solely based on the initial test sample and that can be computed without resampling.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-0-7695-4905-7; POD:978-1-4673-4649-8","10.1109/ICDM.2012.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6413823","Classification;Concept Drift;Model Selection;clustering;unknown distributions","Clustering algorithms;Estimation;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Media;Standards;Vectors","pattern classification;pattern clustering;sampling methods;statistical distributions;text analysis","expected effectiveness estimation;information flood;information overload;information volatility;learning technology;margin distribution;model selection;probabilistic lower bound;repetitive resampling;subclass distribution shift;text classification solution;topic popularity","","0","","15","","","10-13 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is often costly, time consuming, and even dangerous. To deal with these problems, reward shaping has been used as a powerful method to accelerate the learning speed of the agent. The principle idea is to incorporate a numerical feedback, other than environment reward, for the learning agent. However, finding an efficient potential function to shape the reward is still an interesting area of research. In this paper, a new algorithm has been proposed that receives the environment graph, performs some new analysis, and provides the extracted information for the learning agent to accelerate the speed of learning. This information includes sub goals, bad states, and sub environments with different exploration, or reward, values. To evaluate this algorithm an experimental study has been conducted on two benchmark environments, Six Rooms and Maze. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4476-0; POD:978-1-4673-4475-3","10.1109/ICCKE.2012.6395362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6395362","Artificial Feedback;Q-Learning;Reinforcement Learning;Reward Shaping","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Learning;Machine learning;Markov processes","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","agent learning speed;environment reward;graph analysis;machine learning;maze environment;numerical feedback;reinforcement learning;reward shaping;six rooms environment","","2","","19","","","18-19 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study contributes to the literature by considering 15 different Bayesian Network (BN) classifiers and comparing them to other popular machine learning techniques. Furthermore, the applicability of the Markov blanket principle for feature selection, which is a natural extension to BN theory, is investigated.

The advantage of ELM is that it has been shown to attain comparable performance to support vector machine (SVM) but with fewer computational nodes. We describe simulation results of each block designed in 0.35 um CMOS and demonstrate system level performance by using this to detect seizure onset in epileptic patients.

Compared with the classical SVM, the transductive SVM is more robust and can achieve better performance. However, there are some disadvantages still being explored. One of the vital drawbacks is its computational costs. Usually, the SVM and TSVM models need to be retrained from scratch for parameter variations whenever any new samples become available. This problem has hindered the use of transduction learning in many real world applications. To resolve these problems, the online transductive support vector machine (OTSVM) is present to improve the generalization performance of the TSVM model. The OTSVM integrates the incremental learning/decremental unlearning to learn new incoming unlabeled samples one by one and modifies its model parameters at the same time. In addition to this, the OTSVM also dynamically adjusts the labels of unmatched samples. Simulation results illustrate that the OTSVM can improve classification performance and increase its computational efficiency.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2588-2; POD:978-1-4673-2587-5","10.1109/ISIC.2012.6449755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449755","Incremental Learning/Decremental Unlearning;Online TSVM;Transductive SVM","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training","inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","OTSVM;SVM model;TSVM model;classification tasks;computational costs;decremental unlearning;generalization performance improvement;incremental learning;online transductive support vector machines;transduction learning;transductive inference process","","0","","8","","","14-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The HERF is an ensemble of classifiers composed of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) and Decision Trees. Training of the HERF includes optimal rotation of random partitions of the feature set aimed to increase diversity. AL follows an strategy of optimal sample selection in order to minimize the number of data samples needed to obtain a required accuracy degree. AL is pertinent for interactive learning processes where a human operator is required to select training samples to enhance the classifier in an iterative process, therefore labeling samples for training may be a time consuming and expensive process. CTA image segmentation is one of such processes, due to the variability in CTA images which hinders the generalization of classifiers trained on one dataset to new datasets. Following an AL strategy, the human operator is presented with a visual selection of pixels whose labeling would be most informative for the classifier. After adding those labeled pixels to the training data, the classifier is retrained. This iteration is repeated until image segmentation quality meets the required level. The approach is applied to the segmentation of the thrombus in CTA data of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) patients, showing that the structures of interest in CTA volume can be accurately segmented after a few iterations using a small data sample.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5116-4; POD:978-1-4673-5114-0","10.1109/HIS.2012.6421392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6421392","Active Learning;Aortic Aneurysm;Hybrid Rotation Forest;Image Segementation","Accuracy;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Humans;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Training","angiocardiography;blood;blood vessels;computerised tomography;decision trees;feature extraction;generalisation (artificial intelligence);haemodynamics;image classification;image sampling;image segmentation;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","3D computed tomography angiography;AAA patient;CTA image segmentation;ELM;HERF classifier;abdominal aortic aneurysm;classifier ensemble;classifier generalization;classifier training;decision trees;extreme learning machines;feature set;human operator;hybrid extreme rotation forest;image segmentation quality;interactive learning process;iterative process;optimal random partition rotation;optimal sample selection;pixel visual selection;sample labeling;thrombus segmentation","","0","","23","","","4-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach extends an exisiting machine learning based approach by extracting six features from network measurements and implementing a new landmark selection policy. These enhancements allow us to mitigate problems with measurement errors and reduces average error distance in estimating location of Internet hosts. To demonstrate the accuracy of our approach, we evaluate the performance on network routers using ping measurements from PlanetLab nodes with known geographic placement. Our results demonstrate that our approach improves average accuracy by geolocating internet hosts 100 miles closer to the true geographic location versus prior measurement-based approaches.","2155-7578;21557578","Electronic:978-1-4673-1731-3; POD:978-1-4673-1729-0","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415842","","Accuracy;Delay;Extraterrestrial measurements;Geology;IP networks;Internet;Machine learning","IP networks;Internet;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","IP geolocation;Internet hosts;classification accuracy;cyber attacks;enhanced learning classifier approach;geolocating internet hosts;machine learning based approach;measurement-based approaches;network routers;new landmark selection policy","","3","","19","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We integrate three semantic similarity profiles of human genes, a phenotype similarity profile of human diseases, and known associations between diseases and genes to obtain three numerical features that indicate the relevance between a given disease-gene pair. With the features, we use three classification methods (the logistic regression, the random forest, and the support vector machine) to predict whether a gene is truly associated with a disease or not.

Nonetheless, there are often related domains where large corpuses of labeled data can be easily obtained. Therefore, we propose a new transfer learning algorithm to adapt a neural network trained on such a related domain to the target domain by grafting additional nodes onto its hidden layer. This neural grafting method is capable of transfering the knowledge embedded in the structures of the trained neural network to the problem in the target domain. Experiments on synthesized and real data sets show that grafted networks achieve good performance with very small amounts of data from the target domain.

Recently, many new imitation learning algorithms were proposed with promising results, such as throwing a ball into a basket[1], jiggling ping-pong balls on a racket[2], and moving a tendon driven hand to tap a switch[3]. These robots typically start from blindly copying demonstrator's trajectory and then iteratively improve the trajectory with respect to certain predefined “goodness” function. We call it “scoring function.” Most of these tasks are spatial movements and thus the scoring function can be heuristically defined based on the end-effector position or system state. However, in many real life tasks, the outcome of an action is more important rather than the movement trajectory itself. A proper measurable scoring function that evaluates the “goodness” of the outcome is thus necessary. In this work, we consider the case where the scoring function is a not a trivial spatial mapping from robot movement to a scalar. For example, the softness of the sounds of a violin played by a robot with certain contact force and velocity of the bow. Another example is the happiness of a robotic face given the amount of facial servo movement. In this case, the non-trivial cost function needs to be learned either from human demonstrations prior to motor learning or from robot's own exploration during motor learning with feedback from a teacher. In particular, we develop the following learning framework as in Fig. 1. In the proposed framework, both the scoring function as well as the motor policy are learned at the same time. However, the two learning systems do not have to be fully synchronized. For example, the human teacher may decide to give the robot feedback only on some of the executions and let the robot explore by itself most of the - ime.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4965-9; POD:978-1-4673-4964-2; USB:978-1-4673-4963-5","10.1109/DevLrn.2012.6400890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400890","","Force;Humans;Learning systems;Machine learning;Robot sensing systems;Trajectory","end effectors;feedback;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;robotic assembly","ball throwing;end-effector position;factory assembly line;goodness function;human demonstrations;imitation learning algorithms;learning systems;motor policy;motor skill acquisition;nontrivial cost function;ping-pong ball jinggling;robot feedback;scoring function;simultaneous sensory learning;system state;tendon driven hand;trajectory copying;trajectory improvement","","0","","3","","","7-9 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such problems are usually tackled by extracting a fixed number of features from the time series (like their statistical moments), with a consequent loss in information that leads to suboptimal predictive models. Moreover, feature extraction techniques usually make assumptions that are not met by real world settings (e.g. uniformly sampled time series of constant length), and fail to deliver a thorough methodology to deal with noisy data. In this paper a methodology based on functional learning is proposed to overcome the aforementioned problems; the proposed Supervised Aggregative Feature Extraction (SAFE) approach allows to derive continuous, smooth estimates of time series data (yielding aggregate local information), while simultaneously estimating a continuous shape function yielding optimal predictions. The SAFE paradigm enjoys several properties like closed form solution, incorporation of first and second order derivative information into the regressor matrix, interpretability of the generated functional predictor and the possibility to exploit Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces setting to yield nonlinear predictive models.

If the costs are unknown, some approaches can not work properly. Moreover, to our best knowledge, none of the cost-sensitive approaches is able to process the abstaining classifications when costs are unknown for errors and rejects. Therefore, the challenge above forms the motivation of this work. Based on information theory, we propose a novel cost-free learning approach which targets the maximization of normalized mutual information between the target outputs and the decision outputs of classifiers. Using the approach, we can deal with classifications with/without rejections when no cost terms are given. While the degree of class imbalance is changing, the proposed approach is able to balance the errors and rejects accordingly and automatically. Another advantage of the approach is its ability of deriving optimal reject thresholds for abstaining classification and the ""equivalent"" costs for binary probabilistic classification. Numerical investigation is made on several benchmark data sets and the classification results confirm the unique feature of the approach for overcoming the challenge.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-1-4673-5164-5; POD:978-1-4799-1707-5","10.1109/ICDMW.2012.167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406441","imbalanced learning; classification; reject option; cost-free learning; mutual information","Accuracy;Equations;Error analysis;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Mutual information;Vectors","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;probability","benchmark data sets;binary probabilistic classification;class imbalance problem;classifiers;cost-free learning approach;decision outputs;equivalent costs;errors;information theory;normalized mutual information maximization;optimal reject thresholds;rejects;target outputs","","4","","33","","","10-10 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results on Ethernet MAC, I<sup>2</sup>C, and OpenRISC designs show that the generated word level assertions have higher expressiveness and readability than their corresponding bit level assertions.","1092-3152;10923152","Electronic:978-1-4503-1573-9; POD:978-1-4503-1573-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386611","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Concrete;Decision trees;Hardware design languages;Input variables;Machine learning algorithms","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;program verification","Ethernet MAC designs;I<sup>2</sup>C designs;OpenRISC designs;RTL source code;assertion mining;automatic assertion generation methodologies;bit level assertions;dynamic analysis;formal property checking;machine learning;quality enhancement;redundant proposition removal;static analysis;verification methodology;word level feature discovery","","1","","22","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Interactively and Visually Exploring Tours of Marked Nodes in Large Graphs","D. H. Chau; L. Akoglu; J. Vreeken; H. Tong; C. Faloutsos","","2012 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","20130204","2012","","","696","698","We present TOURVIZ, a interactive system for visualizing and making sense of large network datasets. Given a set of user-specified nodes of interest, TOURVIZ integrates 1) novel algorithms to find the best sub graphs that succinctly connect these nodes, and 2) visualization and interaction features that help people explore such sub graphs. We will demonstrate TOURVIZ's usage and benefits using the DBLP co-authorship graph, which consists of 329K authors (nodes) and 1094K co-authorship relations (edges). TOURVIZ can work with any kinds of graphs. We will engage the audience to try our system and comment on its usability, usefulness, and how our system may help with their work and data analytics in their domains.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4799-2; POD:978-1-4673-2497-7","10.1109/ASONAM.2012.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425688","Connection subgraphs;Networks;Sensemaking","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational biology;Connectors;Data visualization;Educational institutions;Machine learning;Usability","data visualisation;graph theory;interactive systems","DBLP coauthorship graph;TOURVIZ;interaction feature;interactively exploring tour;large graph;marked nodes;visualization feature;visually exploring tour","","0","","3","","","26-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
