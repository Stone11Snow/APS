A multilingual preterminological graph is a special lexical resource that contains massive amount of terms related to a special domain, and can be used as raw material to later build a standardized terminological repository. Building such a graph is difficult using traditional approaches, as it needs huge efforts by domain specialists and terminologists. In our approach, we build such a graph by analyzing the access log files of the Web site of the community, and by finding the important terms that have been used to search in that Web site, and their association with each other. We aim at making this graph as a seed repository so multilingual volunteers can contribute. We are experimenting this approach with the Digital Silk Road Project. We have used its access log files since its beginning in 2003, and obtained an initial graph of around 116000 terms. As an application, we used this graph to obtain a preterminological multilingual database that is serving a CLIR system for the DSR project.","","POD:978-1-4244-4138-9","10.1109/SNLP.2009.5340936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5340936","","Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Decision making;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Neural networks;Radial basis function networks;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Weather forecasting","Web sites;directed graphs;information retrieval;information retrieval systems;natural language processing","CLIR system;DSR project;Digital Silk Road Project;MPG;access log file;automatic construction approach;community Web site;cross-language information retrieval;dedicated multilingual preterminological graph construction;directed graph;lexical resource;natural language processing;online community user behavior analysis;online-community resources;preterminological multilingual database;standardized terminological repository;term search","","1","","21","","","20-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are a number of techniques proposed to perform classification. Neural network is one of the artificial intelligent techniques that has many successful examples when applying to this problem. This paper presents a comparison of neural network techniques for binary classification problems. The classification performance obtained by five different types of neural networks for comparison are back propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), general regression neural network (GRNN), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and complementary neural network (CMTNN). The comparison is done based on three benchmark data sets obtained from UCI machine learning repository. The results show that CMTNN typically provide better classification results when comparing to techniques applied to binary classification problems.","","POD:978-1-4244-4138-9","10.1109/SNLP.2009.5340935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5340935","","Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Decision making;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Neural networks;Radial basis function networks;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Weather forecasting","backpropagation;decision making;pattern classification;radial basis function networks","BPNN;CMTNN;GRNN;PNN;RBFNN;artificial intelligent technique;back propagation neural network;binary classification problem;complementary neural network;decision making task;general regression neural network;machine learning repository;neural networks performance comparison;probabilistic neural network;radial basis function neural network","","11","","28","","","20-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve the performance of detection, we propose a Bagging and Boosting based twin support vector machine (BB-TWSVM) to detect MCs. The algorithm is composed of three modules: the image pro-processing, the feature extraction component and the BB-TWSVM module. The ground truth of MCs in mammograms is assumed to be known as a priori. First each MCs is preprocessed by using a simple artifact removal filter and a well designed high-pass filter. Then the combined image feature extractors are employed to extract 164 image features. In the combined image features space, the MCs detection procedure is formulated as a supervised learning and classification problem, and the trained BB-TWSVM is used as a classifier to make decision for the presence of MCs or not.

To address this problem, this paper presents a design of condition monitoring system with one-class classifier and classifier for imbalanced data. Based on the general description of condition monitoring system, support vector data description (SVDD) and Mahalanobis-distance threshold (MDT) are introduced as one-class classifier and classifier for imbalanced data, respectively.

Bilingual or multilingual Web directories thus may relieve such limitations. In this work, we develop an automated process to create multilingual (or bilingual, specifically) Web directories from a set of parallel corpora. We adopted the self-organizing map model to cluster the Web pages and construct Web directories for each language. A hierarchy alignment process was then applied on these monolingual hierarchies to obtain the relationships between different languages. A multilingual Web directory was then created using such relationships.

This model employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to learn the language model from a set of example pairs acquired from parallel corpora and represent the language model in a rule-based format that maps Arabic sentence pattern to English sentence pattern.

Motivated by the need to classify sentences in Korean whose sentiment-revealing expressions tend to have different effects according to their syntactic categories, we employed a language modeling (LM) approach with 162 different LMs based on syntactic categories that are effectively combined with a logistic regression classifier. The experimental results show that this approach significantly outperforms clue-based SVM classifiers. The enumeration of feature types arising from the LMs for the logistic regression classifier allowed us to show that domain specific models can be smoothed with a general model and that attaching a syntactic category to a feature helps improving effectiveness. The classification results are further improved by applying a clue-based classifier. The rationale behind this two-step process is to classify sentences with a relatively conservative classifier in picking positive and negative sentences and to apply a high-precision classifier to the sentences in the neutral class.","","POD:978-1-4244-4538-7","10.1109/NLPKE.2009.5313746","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5313746","Text Categorization;polarity classification;sentiment analysis","Joining processes;Labeling;Logistics;Machine learning;Motion pictures;Natural languages;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Text categorization;Training data","classification;natural language processing;regression analysis;text analysis","clue-based classifier;language modeling;logistic regression classifier;sentence-level sentiment analysis;sentiment classification;syntactic category","","0","","15","","","24-27 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of them focus on improving the overall performance of the system without considering individual user's behavior or preferences. In this paper, we present an elliptic shape detection model from user's sketch strokes based on genetic algorithm. We then use a model based on user's preference to choose the most appropriate shape to be either a perfect circle or an ellipse. The user model is automatically constructed using the winnow algorithm, an incremental machine learning technique, based on features related to the shape obtained from the genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm implemented in this research uses (x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>,r<sub>0</sub>,r<sub>1</sub>,thetas) as a set of chromosome. Fitness function evaluates the points sampled from sketch strokes whether the shape generated is proper to the strokes or not. Recognition is done once every time the user lifts up the pointer.

The user study was accompanied by three pre-structured questionnaires, addressing the users' satisfaction with HOAP-3, the users' affect toward the robot caused by the interaction, and the users' attitude towards robots. Furthermore, a retrospective think aloud was conducted to gain a better understanding of what influences the users' satisfaction in learning by demonstration tasks. A high task completion and final satisfaction rate could be observed. These results stress that learning by demonstration is a promising approach for nave users to learn the interaction with a robot Moreover, the short term interaction with HOAP-3 led to a positive affect, higher than the normative average on half of the female users.","1944-9445;19449445","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-5081-7","10.1109/ROMAN.2009.5326274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326274","","Collaborative work;Education;Educational robots;Feedback;Human robot interaction;Humanoid robots;Machine learning;Performance analysis;Robotic assembly;Stress","human-robot interaction;humanoid robots;intelligent robots","HOAP-3;demonstration tasks;humanoid;learning by demonstration;satisfaction rate;task completion","","6","","24","","","Sept. 27 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we take a look at two different approaches for eye detection under difficult acquisition circumstances, including low-light, distance, pose variation, and blur. A new machine learning approach and several correlation filter approaches, including a new adaptive variant, are compared. We present experimental results on a variety of controlled data sets (derived from FERET and CMU PIE) that have been re-imaged under the difficult conditions of interest with an EMCCD based acquisition system. The results of our experiments show that our new detection approaches are extremely accurate under all tested conditions, and significantly improve detection accuracy compared to a leading commercial detector.

The method preselects top-ranked features using a statistic t-test combined with feature importance score estimated by Random Forests. It uses the combined score as heuristic info and the classification accuracy of Random Forests as positive feedback for ant colony to refine the feature subset preselected. In order to accelerate convergence of ant colony, it distributes ants to different features and confines the size of solution to obtain quickly optimum and near-optimum. As a post processing, it employs restricted sequential forward selection (SFS) to construct optimum from near-optimum. Experiments show the method proposed provides higher recognition with smaller feature subset on two microarray gene expression data.","","POD:978-1-4244-5209-5","10.1109/NCM.2009.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5331791","Ant Colony Optimization (ACO);Random Forests (RF);cancer classification;feature selection;sequential forward selection (SFS)","Ant colony optimization;Cancer;Clustering algorithms;Data analysis;Data mining;Drugs;Feedback;Gene expression;Machine learning algorithms;Radio frequency","bioinformatics;cancer;data mining;optimisation","ant colony optimization;cancer;feature selection method;gene;microarray data;random forests;sequential forward selection","","1","","15","","","25-27 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Investigation of these characteristics using computational methods provides a powerful resource. However, these methods have limitations in their ability to annotate the characteristics of proteins accurately. In an attempt to overcome this drawback, we have developed a unified computational pipeline, called the Gestalt domain detection algorithm basic local alignment tool (GDDA-BLAST), for measuring the structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics of a protein. The performance of GDDA-BLAST is better than those of other method such as SAM and psi-BLAST in homology detection. Using GDDA-BLAST, we implemented a classification library to find quantitative thresholds capable of inferring protein function. Using this library, we first identified RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) containing structural unique motifs by 2695 expanded position specific scoring metric (PSSM) profiles in a testing dataset with 37 positive and 118 negative sequences. We achieved 100% specificity, 96.8% accuracy, and 86.5% sensitivity. For the specific nucleotide binding folds (dsRNA vs. dsDNA, dsRNA vs. dsDNA, and ssRNA vs. ssDNA), our results exceeded those of obtained using support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithms. Using this method, we also identified 29 and 168 novel RBPs in yeast and human proteomes. We extend our experiment to additional protein functions, such as Ankyrin-repeat (ANK), integral lipid-binding(ILB), and calmodulin(CaM)-binding. For ANK, 449 ANK PSSMs are used to measure 126 negative and 32 postive sequences. And, for ILB and CaM-binding, we had used 24,378 PSSMs to measure 24 negatives and 32 positives, and 820 PSSMs used to measure 17 negatives and 65 positives, respectively. By ROC curve analysis,calmodulin we achieved ~100%, ~93%, ~72% sensitivity at false positive rate ~10%, for ANK, ILB, and CaM-binding classification. The result again con- firmed that we can classify the proteins using function-specific PSSM sets. We believe that the performance can be improved with more carefully curated PSSM sets. All of these results suggest that this method can be used to create PSSM databases for the quantitative measurement and classification of any protein function.","","POD:978-1-4244-5121-0","10.1109/BIBMW.2009.5332093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5332093","","Amino acids;Detection algorithms;Fungi;Libraries;Machine learning;Pipelines;Protein engineering;Sensitivity;Support vector machines;Testing","DNA;bioinformatics;macromolecules;molecular biophysics;pattern classification;proteins;proteomics","Ankyrin-repeat protein function;CaM-binding classification;Gestalt domain detection algorithm basic local alignment tool;PSSM databases;RNA-binding proteins;ROC curve analysis;amino acid sequence;bioinformatics;calmodulin-binding protein function;classification library;dsDNA;dsRNA;functional PSSM;human proteomes;integral lipid-binding protein function;nucleotide binding folds;position specific scoring metric profiles;primary protein sequence;protein classification;structural-specific PSSM;unified computational pipeline;yeast","","0","","3","","","1-4 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is important to define and choose the features of an image suitably, so that the classification algorithm can perform at its best in distinguishing object classes. In this paper we investigate the performance of different types of texture-based features when used with a support vector machine. Their performance was evaluated on standardized image datasets and compared. The objective of this study was to come up with a suitable algorithm to distinguish bicycles from pedestrians in locations such as bicycle paths and trails in order to estimate their traffic. The models developed during this study were applied in practice to traffic videos and the results are summarized here.

Specifically, the algorithm employs online learning technique in a 2nu-granular soft support vector machine for rapidly training and updating face recognition systems. The proposed online classifier is used in a face recognition application for classifying genuine and impostor match scores impacted by different covariates.

The PB algorithm selects the filters and quantizers which lead to accurate classification of matching and nonmatching audio pairs: a matching pair is an audio pair that should be classified as being identical, and a nonmatching pair is a pair that should be classified as being different. By iteratively reducing the classification error of both matching and nonmatching pairs, the PB algorithm improves both the robustness and discriminating ability.

The uncertainty reduction of the whole unlabeled set caused by an instance is measured by the instance's uncertainty and its influence index on the whole unlabeled set. To calculate the influence index conveniently, we introduces the similar matrix, the elements of which are the similarities measured by the distances between instances. The new method avoids the drawbacks that some abnormal or isolated samples may be selected by original method.

It enjoys a special status in linguistic theories especially in dependency grammars, which require the exceptional treatment. This paper proposes three schemes to analyse coordinating structure and builds dependency treebanks for automatic parsing. We find that different schemes to annotate and parse the coordinating structure bring some distinctions in precision and other aspects. The factors, such as the part-of-speech categories matching with their syntactic functions, may play an important role in dependency parsing. We also calculate the mean dependency distance of three schemes, and the result shows that single-directional and smaller mean dependency distance is helpful for better machine learning and higher precision.","","POD:978-1-4244-4538-7","10.1109/NLPKE.2009.5313780","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5313780","Coordinatiing structure;annotation;dependency distance;dependency grammar;parser","Frequency;Humans;Machine learning;Magnetic heads","grammars;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","automatic parsing;coordinating structure;dependency grammars;dependency parsing;dependency treebanks;human languages;machine learning;mean dependency distance","","0","","18","","","24-27 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Statistics show that the emotion lexicons derived from Ren-CECps are used more often in real use of language for emotional expressions than HOWNET sentimental lexicons. Kernel methods are state-of-the-art for solving machine learning problems. Polynomial kernel (PK) method is used to compute the similarities between sentences and the eight emotion lexicons.

"An automatic indexing technique for Thai texts using frequent max substring","T. Chumwatana; K. W. Wong; H. Xie","School of Information Technology Murdoch University, South St, Murdoch Western Australia 6150","2009 Eighth International Symposium on Natural Language Processing","20091201","2009","","","67","72","Thai language is considered as a non-segmented language where words are a string of symbols without explicit word boundaries, and also the structure of written Thai language is highly ambiguous. This problem causes an indexing technique has become a main issue in Thai text retrieval. To construct an inverted index for Thai texts, an index terms extraction technique is usually required to segment texts into index term schemes. Although index terms can be specified manually by experts, this process is very time consuming and labor-intensive. Word segmentation is one of the many techniques that are used to automatically extract index terms from Thai texts. However, most of the word segmentation techniques require linguistic knowledge and the preparation of these approaches is time consuming. An n-gram based approach is another automatic index terms extraction method that is often used as indexing technique for Asian languages including Thai. This approach is language independent which does not require any linguistic knowledge or dictionary. Although the n-gram approach out performs many indexing techniques for Asian languages in term of retrieval effectiveness, the disadvantage of n-gram approach is it suffers from large storage space and long retrieval time. In this paper we present the frequent max substring mining to extract index terms from Thai texts. Our method is language-independent and it does not rely on any dictionary or language grammatical knowledge. Frequent max substring mining is based on text mining that describes a process of discovering useful information or knowledge from unstructured texts. This approach uses the analysis of frequent max substring sets to extract all long and frequently-occurred substrings. We aim to employ the frequent max substring mining algorithm to address the drawback of n-gram based approach by keeping only frequent max substrings to reduce disk space requirement for storing index terms and to reduce the retrieval time in or- der to deal with the rapid growth of Thai texts.","","POD:978-1-4244-4138-9","10.1109/SNLP.2009.5340946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5340946","","Data mining;Dictionaries;Frequency;Information retrieval;Machine assisted indexing;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Text mining","data mining;indexing;information retrieval;natural language processing;text analysis","Asian language;Thai text retrieval;automatic indexing technique;dictionary;frequent max substring mining;index term extraction technique;knowledge discovery;language-independent method;linguistic knowledge;n-gram based approach;nonsegmented language;text mining;text segmentation;word segmentation","","3","","30","","","20-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of SVR for Web effort estimation, in particular when dealing with a cross-company dataset. To gain a deeper insight on the method, we carried out an empirical study using four kernels for SVR, namely linear, polynomial, Gaussian, and sigmoid. Moreover, we used two variables' preprocessing strategies (normalization and logarithmic), and two different dependent variables (effort and inverse effort). As a result, SVR was applied using six different configurations for each kernel. As for the dataset, we employed the Tukutuku database, which is widely adopted in Web effort estimation studies. A hold-out approach was adopted to evaluate the prediction accuracy for all the configurations, using two training sets, each containing data on 130 projects randomly selected, and two test sets, each containing the remaining 65 projects. As benchmark, SVR-based predictions were also compared to predictions obtained using manual stepwise regression, case-based reasoning, and Bayesian networks. Our results suggest that SVR performed well, since on the first hold-out, the linear kernel with a logarithmic transformation of variables provided significantly superior prediction accuracy than all the other techniques, while for the second hold-out, the Gaussian kernel achieved significantly superior predictions than all other techniques, except for manual stepwise regression.","1949-3770;19493770","POD:978-1-4244-4842-5","10.1109/ESEM.2009.5315991","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5315991","","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Benchmark testing;Data preprocessing;Databases;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Manuals;Polynomials;Predictive models","Gaussian processes;Internet;belief networks;case-based reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;support vector machines","Bayesian networks;Gaussian kernel;Tukutuku database;Web effort estimation;case-based reasoning;cross-company dataset;logarithmic preprocessing strategy;machine learning algorithms;manual stepwise regression;normalization preprocessing strategy;predictive data modeling problems;support vector regression","","6","","42","","","15-16 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sample selection is a feasible strategy to overcome the problem. From the geometry of SVM, it is clear that a SVM problem can be converted to a problem of computing the nearest points between two convex hulls. The convex hulls virtually determine the separating plane of SVM. Since a convex hull of a set only can be constructed by boundary samples of the convex hull, using boundary samples of each class to train SVM will be equivalent to using all training samples to train the classifier. In order to select boundary samples, this paper introduces a novel sample selection strategy named Kernel Subclass Convex Hull (KSCH) sample selection strategy, which iteratively select boundary samples of each class convex hull in high dimensional space (induced by kernel trick). Experimental results on face databases show that our KSCH sample selection method can select fewer high quality samples to maintain SVM with high recognition accuracy and quickly executing speed.","","POD:978-1-4244-4199-0","10.1109/CCPR.2009.5343996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5343996","","Clustering algorithms;Face recognition;Kernel;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Quadratic programming;Security;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);sampling methods;support vector machines","boundary samples;face recognition;kernel subclass convex hull;large scale learning tasks;sampling-based SVM;support vector machine","","1","","20","","","4-6 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve these problems, we propose a system named key terms extraction and term weighting (KETW) to automatically classify new messages for large newsgroup data sets. The system consists of two parts: (1) utilize the special properties of newsgroup data to extract representative terms for each group and use these terms for training rather than the whole vocabulary; (2) give terms different weights according to their importance.

Ensembles of classifiers have been shown to be able to improve the predictive accuracy as well as the robustness of single classification methods. In this work novel incremental variants of several well-known classifier fusion methods (Fuzzy Integral, Decision Templates, Dempster-Shafer Combination and Discounted Dempster-Shafer Combination) are presented. Furthermore, a novel incremental classifier fusion method called Incremental Direct Cluster-based fusion will be introduced, which exploits an evolving clustering approach. A flexible and interactive framework for on-line learning will be introduced, in which the ensemble (classifier fusion) methods are adapted incrementally in a sample-wise manner together with their base classifiers.

The BLUE algorithm that benefits from a different structure has tried to compensate some of them in a successful way [2]. A quick review on active queue management algorithms from the very beginning indicates that most of them tried to improve classic algorithms. Some of them use network traffic history to achieve more flexibility and prediction ability while others use algorithms such as fuzzy logic to address scalability problem and high input load. Our proposed approach benefits from both: Using fuzzy logic to deal with high input load and embedding expert knowledge into the algorithm while optimizing router decisions with reinforcement learning fed by network traffic history. We call this approach ""DEEP BLUE"" as is consist of an improved version of BLUE algorithm. Derived from BLUE, our algorithm uses packet drop rate and link idle events to manage congestion. Our experiments using OPNET simulator shows that this scheme works faster and more efficient than original BLUE.","","POD:978-0-7695-3827-3","10.1109/ICAIS.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5328070","Active Queue Management;Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning;OPNET Simulation","Artificial intelligence;Automatic control;Computer science;Delay;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy logic;Intelligent structures;Machine learning algorithms;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","fuzzy logic;learning (artificial intelligence);queueing theory;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","BLUE algorithm;OPNET simulator;RED algorithm;TCP;active queue management algorithm;congestion management;expert knowledge;fuzzy logic;fuzzy q-learning;high input load;network traffic;packet drop rate;random early detection algorithm;reinforcement learning;router decisions optimization;scalability problem","","4","","16","","","24-26 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first part provides an overview of knowledge discovery focusing on life sciences and describes the main motivations for developing and applying knowledge discovery methods to analyze complex biological data. The paper briefly describes a few case studies where the analysis of high throughput biological data using unsupervised or supervised machine learning techniques is demonstrated. These are cases in which real biological data sets (obtained from public or private sources) have been analyzed and studied for tasks such as gene function identification and gene response analysis. Several sources of public data sets will be covered, among which is GEO (gene expression omnibus) which is the most popular and well known source of today's biological data. The objective is to show the impacts of knowledge discovery in the entire bioinformatics pipeline. This consists of data pre-processing, data characteristics recognition, pattern recognition and validation of results. In the second part, the paper describes how discovered and validated knowledge could be structured into a knowledge base where it can be integrated with other forms of knowledge, for dissemination to multiple users and its expansion. Several topics might be related to challenges in knowledge management, as this is not a trivial task and it is rather a demanding paradigm.","2155-6938;21556938","POD:978-1-4244-4944-6","10.1109/DMO.2009.5341924","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341924","","Bioinformatics;Biology;Character recognition;Data analysis;Gene expression;Knowledge management;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Pipelines;Throughput","","","","0","","","","","27-28 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A significant factor for the unstable throughput of peers' uplink is the behavior of other processes running on the source peer that consume bandwidth resources.In this paper we propose Maxtream - a machine learning based solution that actively predicts load in the uplink of streaming peers and coordinates source peers exchanges between peers that suffer from buffer under run and peers that enjoy satisfactory buffer size for coping with future problems.Simulation and experiments have shown that the solution successfully predicts upcoming load in popular protocols and can improve the QoS in existing P2P streaming networks.","","POD:978-0-7695-3658-3","10.1109/MUE.2009.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318973","Behavior;Learning;Maxtream;P2P;Patterns;Prediction;Stabilize;Streaming","Bandwidth;Costs;Delay;Machine learning;Peer to peer computing;Predictive models;Protocols;Streaming media;Throughput;User-generated content","bandwidth allocation;learning (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing;quality of service;telecommunication computing","IPTV;Maxtream machine learning;QoS;VOD;active behavior pattern prediction;bandwidth resource consumption;frequent annoying hiccup;peer-to-peer streaming system;protocol","","1","1","33","","","4-6 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OACS regresses the field intensity function with kernel Support Vector Regression (SVR), a novel machine learning tool that flexibly handles both contour line and contour map requests. OACS also adaptively accommodates a wide range of contour line/map precision requirements: (1) For applications of low precision, only a minimum set of nodes are scheduled in working mode while others are sleeping for conserving energy. (2) For applications of high precision, through an active and progressive learning algorithm, OACS determines the best set of nodes that should be turned on for improving the contour line/map precision. Evaluation based on diverse realistic models demonstrates that OACS provides quality and seamless contour services for various application requirements yet significantly conserves energy.","2155-6806;21556806","POD:978-1-4244-5114-2","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336974","","Active contours;Computer networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Energy efficiency;Kernel;Machine learning;Power engineering and energy;Scheduling algorithm;Wireless sensor networks","environmental factors;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;energy-efficient on-demand active contour service;environmental monitoring;field intensity function;kernel support vector regression;machine learning tool;power-constrained WSN;wireless sensor networks","","0","","34","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an improved version of ISOMAP, namely multi-class multi-manifold ISOMAP (MCMM-ISOMAP), is proposed. MCMM-ISOMAP constructs a single neighborhood graph not by increasing the value of neighborhood parameter, but by the following steps that first choose appropriate value with which short-circuit edges can not be introduced, second find such pairwise data each of which are two endpoints of the shortest Euclidean distance between classes, and finally make them neighborhood points each other. Thereby a single neighborhood graph will form, and then ISOMAP algorithm is applied to find the intrinsic low-dimensional embedding structure.

China","2009 Fourth International on Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing","20091117","2009","","","1","7","For scaling up reinforcement learning to large and complex problems, we propose an approach to partition the larger state space into multiple smaller state spaces based the critical states for decomposing learning task. During learning process, we record every training episode, and eliminate the state loops existed in it. We find some states have high probability (even to 1) appeared in all these acyclic episodes. We call these states critical states. That means, if agent wants to reach the goal state, then it will have high probability to pass these critical states according to the learned experience. So the critical states can be used to partition the state space for accomplishing learning task by stages. We also prove that the optimal policy found in the partitioned smaller state space is equivalent to the optimal policy found in the original state space. The experiment comparisons between Q-learning and Q-learning with critical states demonstrate our approach more effective. The more important is that our approach brings the light of how agent can use its own experience to plan learning for better performance.","","POD:978-1-4244-3866-2","10.1109/BICTA.2009.5338123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5338123","","Convergence;Humans;Information science;Machine learning;Psychology;Scheduling;State-space methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","Q-learning;critical states;reinforcement learning;state space partitioning","","1","","13","","","16-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method share the same 'neighborhood preserving' property with other manifold learning methods, however, it describe the local structure in a different way, which makes each neighborhood like a s rigid balls, thus prevents the overlapping phenomenon which often happens when coping with highly nonlinear data.

To compensate a possible sub-optimal classifier, our proposed ensemble learning methods aggregates classifiers built by the active example selection algorithm. We implement this ensemble learning method based on the active example selection algorithm using incremental naive Bayes classifiers. Our empirical results show that we greatly improve the performance of classification models trained by five real world imbalanced biomedical data.

One of the reasons is a deficit in understanding where the suggestions come from and how they come. This essentially is not a technical problem, but a technology adoption problem. This situation was also analyzed as a result of former empirical studies conducted on ReleasePlanner<sup>TM</sup>, a decision support tool for planning product releases. To overcome this situation, three machine learning techniques have been applied to mine the tool's solutions, and the mining results are presented to the tool users as explanations. This paper presents the evaluation on the generated explanations as a means to improve the user acceptance of the tool. Method: A three-stage controlled experiment was designed and carried out with a group of ten graduate students at the University of Calgary and another group of five project managers from the IT industry. Two research goals were addressed to (i) evaluate the impact of the explanations generated from these three applied techniques, and (ii) compare some of the findings from this study with the ones from our previous experiments. Results: Our findings for the first research goal indicated that the explanations generated from the three techniques contributed to the improvement of the subjects' confidence in the tool solutions and trust of the tool, and therefore an overall better user acceptance of the tool. Meanwhile, no significant differences were found among the impacts of the three techniques. For the second research goal, we found that some of the findings from this study were consistent with the ones from our previous experiments.","1949-3770;19493770","POD:978-1-4244-4842-5","10.1109/ESEM.2009.5316049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5316049","","Decision making;Industrial control;Machine learning;Particle measurements;Process planning;Product development;Project management;Software engineering;Software measurement;Technology transfer","decision support systems;learning (artificial intelligence);software development management","ReleasePlanner<sup>TM</sup> tool;decision support tool;machine learning techniques;product release planning;technology adoption problem","","1","","30","","","15-16 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a priority based cross-layer transmission scheme using the idea of ldquounequal protectionrdquo is proposed to improve video transmission quality of MANETs.
