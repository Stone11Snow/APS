"SLFE: A New Semi-supervised Local Feature Extraction Algorithm","C. Tan; G. Ji; B. Zhao","Sch. of Comput.

Feature extraction method has attracted much attention for its effective application to data classification. Traditional classification algorithms may take less advantage of labeled samples information. Based on the property that data with the same class label locate in one manifold and data labeled different classes locate in corresponding manifolds, we combine the labeled manifold information and local distance. Online learning and Out-of-Sample problems are recent hot topics. To solve these problems, a novel algorithm named Semi-supervised Local Feature Extraction (SLFE) is proposed in this paper. First we extract feature in semi-supervised way, then we define a novel manifold similarity to construct local tangent space matrix incrementally. In order to obtain multi-manifold objective function, we utilize an explicit mapping function to overcome the Out-of-Sample problem. Experiments have been carried out on several UCI datasets and real world image datasets(such as ORL, MNIST)with comparisons to some related semi-supervised feature extraction methods. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain better performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8537-4; POD:978-1-4673-8538-1","10.1109/CBD.2015.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7435490","","Big data;Data mining;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Linear programming;Machine learning algorithms;Manifolds","feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;visual databases","Big Data stream;MNIST dataset;ORL dataset;SLFE algorithm;UCI datasets;data classification;data labelling;explicit mapping function;labeled manifold information;local distance;local tangent space matrix;machine learning;manifold similarity;multimanifold objective function;online learning;out-of-sample problems;real world image dataset;semisupervised local feature extraction algorithm","","","","22","","","Oct. 30 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a very important problem with deep root in history as many classical texts have doubtful attributions. The information age and ubiquitous use of the Internet is further complicating this problem and adding more dimensions to it. We are interested in the modern version of this problem where the text whose authorship needs authentication is an online text found in online social networks. Specifically, we are interested in the authorship authentication of tweets. This is not the only challenging aspect we consider here. Another challenging aspect is the language of the tweets. Most current works and existing tools support English. We chose to focus on the very important, yet largely understudied, Arabic language. Finally, we add another challenging aspect to the problem at hand by addressing it at a very large scale. We present our effort to employ big data analytics to address the authorship authentication problem of Arabic tweets. We start by crawling a dataset of more than 53K tweets distributed across 20 authors. We then use preprocessing steps to clean the data and prepare it for analysis. The next step is to compute the feature vectors of each tweet. We use the Bag-Of-Words (BOW) approach and compute the weights using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). Then, we feed the dataset to a Naive Bayes classifier implemented on a parallel and distributed computing framework known as Hadoop. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works on authorship authentication of Arabic text addressed the unique challenges associated with (1) tweets and (2) large-scale datasets. This makes our work unique on many levels. The results show that the testing accuracy is not very high (61.6%), which is expected in the very challenging setting that we consider.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5697-0; POD:978-1-5090-0343-3","10.1109/UCC.2015.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7431455","","Algorithm design and analysis;Authentication;Big data;Clustering algorithms;Electronic mail;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Big Data;natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","Arabic language;Arabic text;Arabic tweets;BOW approach;Bag-Of-Words approach;Big Data analytics;Hadoop;Internet;Naive Bayes classifier;TF-IDF;authorship authentication problem;classical texts;distributed computing framework;information age;online social networks;online text;term frequency-inverse document frequency;ubiquitous use","","","","29","","","7-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An IOT-based distributed structure is implemented to execute data interaction. Stacked sparse autoencoder is used to extract the high-level representation from massive monitoring data acquired automatically from actual smart meter network.

This is a very difficult problem and normally requires manual adjustment to achieve artifact-free quality. For instance, it normally requires human-labelled color scribbles on the grayscale target image or a careful selection of colorful reference images (e.g., capturing the same scene in the grayscale target image). Unlike the previous methods, this paper aims at a high-quality fully-automatic colorization method. With the assumption of a perfect patch matching technique, the use of an extremely large-scale reference database (that contains sufficient color images) is the most reliable solution to the colorization problem. However, patch matching noise will increase with respect to the size of the reference database in practice. Inspired by the recent success in deep learning techniques which provide amazing modeling of large-scale data, this paper re-formulates the colorization problem so that deep learning techniques can be directly employed. To ensure artifact-free quality, a joint bilateral filtering based post-processing step is proposed. Numerous experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-art algorithms both in terms of quality and speed.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8391-2; POD:978-1-4673-8392-9","10.1109/ICCV.2015.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410412","","Databases;Feature extraction;Gray-scale;Image color analysis;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons","image colour analysis;image filtering;image matching;learning (artificial intelligence)","colorful image;colorful reference images;deep colorization;deep learning techniques;extremely large-scale reference database;grayscale image;high-quality fully-automatic colorization method;human-labelled color;joint bilateral filtering based post-processing;patch matching noise;patch matching technique","","7","","27","","","7-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The unprecedented accuracy of deep learning methods has turned them into the foundation of new AI-based services on the Internet. Commercial companies that collect user data on a large scale have been the main beneficiaries of this trend since the success of deep learning techniques is directly proportional to the amount of data available for training. Massive data collection required for deep learning presents obvious privacy issues. Users' personal, highly sensitive data such as photos and voice recordings is kept indefinitely by the companies that collect it. Users can neither delete it, nor restrict the purposes for which it is used. Furthermore, centrally kept data is subject to legal subpoenas and extrajudicial surveillance. Many data owners-for example, medical institutions that may want to apply deep learning methods to clinical records-are prevented by privacy and confidentiality concerns from sharing the data and thus benefitting from large-scale deep learning. In this paper, we present a practical system that enables multiple parties to jointly learn an accurate neural-network model for a given objective without sharing their input datasets. We exploit the fact that the optimization algorithms used in modern deep learning, namely, those based on stochastic gradient descent, can be parallelized and executed asynchronously. Our system lets participants train independently on their own datasets and selectively share small subsets of their models' key parameters during training. This offers an attractive point in the utility/privacy tradeoff space: participants preserve the privacy of their respective data while still benefitting from other participants' models and thus boosting their learning accuracy beyond what is achievable solely on their own inputs. We demonstrate the accuracy of our pr- vacy-preserving deep learning on benchmark datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1824-6; POD:978-1-5090-1825-3","10.1109/ALLERTON.2015.7447103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7447103","","Companies;Data models;Data privacy;Decision support systems;Machine learning;Privacy;Training","data privacy;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation","AI-based services;Internet;artificial intelligence;artificial neural networks;data classification;data collection;data modeling;data privacy;data recognition;optimization algorithms;privacy-preserving deep learning;stochastic gradient descent","","1","","1","","","Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach preserves the aesthesis of the facial images while achieving the goal of privacy protection. In particular, we explore a deep learning-based facial identity-preserving (FIP) features. Unlike conventional face descriptors, the FIP features can significantly reduce intra-identity variances, while maintaining inter-identity distinctions. By suppressing and tinkering FIP features, we achieve the goal of k-anonymity facial image de-identification while preserving desired utilities.

The effective and widely practiced biometric schemes are based upon the principle of “who you are” which utilizes inherent and unique characteristics of the user. In this context, the behavioral biometrics such as sliding dynamics and pressure intensity make use of on-screen sliding movements to infer the user's patterns. In this paper, we present Safeguard, an accurate and efficient smartphone user reauthentication (verification) system based upon on-screen finger movements. The computation and processing is performed at back-end which is transparent to the users. The key feature of the proposed system lies in fine-grained on-screen biometric metrics, i.e., sliding dynamics and pressure intensity, which are unique to each user under diverse scenarios. We first implement our scheme through five machine learning approaches and finally select the support vector machine (SVM)-based approach due to its high accuracy. We further analyze Safeguard to be robust against adversary imitation. We validate the efficacy of our approach through implementation on off-the-shelf smartphone followed by practical evaluation under different scenarios. We process a set of more than 50 000 effective samples derived from a raw dataset of over 10 000 slides collected from each of the 60 volunteers over a period of one month. The experimental results show that Safeguard can verify a user with 0.03% false acceptance rate (FAR) and 0.05% false rejection rate (FRR) within 0.3 s with 15 to 20 slides by the user.

We apply this method to a new dataset of images from 23 different restaurants, using a CNN-based classifier, significantly outperforming previous work.

In supervised learning, classification performance often deteriorates when the training set is imbalanced where at least one of the classes has a substantially fewer number of instances than the others. We propose to use adaptive synthetic sampling approach (ADASYN) to generate synthetic instances for the minority class. A data pruning process based on multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) is then performed to identify a sub-set of synthetic instances that are most suitable to supplement the existing minority instances. This results in a relatively more balanced training dataset which is then bootstrapped and fed into the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification. Furthermore, we propose to use low-level features pre-processed by principal component analysis (PCA), instead of the commonly used raw signal data, as the input to CNNs to reduce the computational time.

The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel “What-if” module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal. This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer and one data authentication layer for field devices.

However, most existing approaches heavily rely on human-curated training data, which hinders the scalability to large and unlabeled vocabularies in image tagging. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised deep learning model which can be trained from the readily available Web images to relax the dependence on human labors and scale up to arbitrary tags (categories). Specifically, based on the assumption that features of true samples in a category tend to be similar and noises tend to be variant, we embed the feature map of the last deep layer into a new affinity representation, and further minimize the discrepancy between the affinity representation and its low-rank approximation. The discrepancy is finally transformed into the objective function to give relevance feedback to back propagation. Experiments show that we can achieve a performance gain of 14.0% in terms of a semantic-based relevance metric in image tagging with 63,043 tags from the WordNet, against the typical deep model trained on the ImageNet 1,000 vocabulary set.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8391-2; POD:978-1-4673-8392-9","10.1109/ICCV.2015.230","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410587","","Machine learning;Noise measurement;Robustness;Tagging;Training;Training data;Vocabulary","approximation theory;backpropagation;feature extraction;image representation;image retrieval;relevance feedback","ImageNet;Web images;WordNet;affinity representation;back propagation;feature map;human labors;image categories;low-rank approximation;objective function;relevance feedback;semantic-based relevance metric;vocabulary-free image tagging;weakly-supervised deep learning model","","4","","27","","","7-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main challenges for accurate MR prostate localization lie in two aspects: (1) inhomogeneous and inconsistent appearance around prostate boundary, and (2) the large shape variation across different patients. To tackle these two problems, we propose a new deformable MR prostate segmentation method by unifying deep feature learning with the sparse patch matching. First, instead of directly using handcrafted features, we propose to learn the latent feature representation from prostate MR images by the stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE). Since the deep learning algorithm learns the feature hierarchy from the data, the learned features are often more concise and effective than the handcrafted features in describing the underlying data. To improve the discriminability of learned features, we further refine the feature representation in a supervised fashion. Second, based on the learned features, a sparse patch matching method is proposed to infer a prostate likelihood map by transferring the prostate labels from multiple atlases to the new prostate MR image. Finally, a deformable segmentation is used to integrate a sparse shape model with the prostate likelihood map for achieving the final segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the dataset that contains 66 T2-wighted prostate MR images. Experimental results show that the deep-learned features are more effective than the handcrafted features in guiding MR prostate segmentation. Moreover, our method shows superior performance than other state-of-the-art segmentation methods.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2015.2508280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7353170","Deformable model;MR prostate segmentation;sparse patch matching;stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE)","Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Deformable models;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Shape","biological organs;biomedical MRI;cancer;feature extraction;image matching;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;radiation therapy","T2-wighted prostate MR images;accurate MR prostate localization;clinical applications;dataset;deep feature learning;deformable MR prostate segmentation;feature hierarchy;handcrafted features;inconsistent prostate boundary appearance;inhomogeneous prostate boundary appearance;latent feature representation;prostate cancer radiotherapy;prostate likelihood map;shape variation;sparse patch matching;stacked sparse autoencoder;state-of-the-art segmentation methods","","3","","56","","20151211","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To conduct such experiments, we built a corpus of labeled Twitter data with size of 7622 Twitter text taken from 69 Twitter accounts, manually labeled by 5 native speakers. We used 6 basic emotion labels (angry, disgust, fear, joy, sad, surprise) and add one label of neutral emotion class. Here, we compared a rule based method with a statistical based method. In the rule based method, we employed the existing Synesketch algorithm with two types of emotion word list: a manually written and a translated WordNet-Affect list. In the statistical based method, we employed SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm with unigram feature and feature selection algorithms of Information Gain and Minimum Frequency. Other than a pure statistical based method, we also employed the manually built emotion word list in the SVM based classification. In the text pre-processing, we compared several methods such as the normalization, emotion conversion, stop words removal, number removal, and a one-character token removal. The experimental results showed that the statistical based method result of 71.740% accuracy score is higher than the rule based method of 63.172% accuracy score. To enhance the accuracy, we employed SMOTE in order to handle the imbalanced data and achieved best result with the f-measure of 83.203%.

Many algorithms, such as singular value thresholding, soft-impute and fixed point continuation, have been proposed for solving this problem. Typically, these existing algorithms require implementing a singular value decomposition of a data matrix at each iteration. Thus, these algorithms are not scalable when the size of the matrix is very large. Motivated by the principle of robust principal component analysis, in this paper we propose a novel MC algorithm, called robust and scalable MC with Kronecker product (RSKP), which models the original data matrix as a low-rank matrix plus a sparse matrix. Furthermore, we represent the low-rank matrix as the Kronecker product of two small-size matrices. Using the Kronecker product makes the model scalable, and introducing the sparse matrix makes the model more robust. We apply our RSKP algorithm to image recovery problems which can be naturally represented by a data matrix with the Kronecker product structure. Experimental results show that our RSKP is efficient and effective in real applications.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8796-5; POD:978-1-4673-8797-2; USB:978-1-4673-8795-8","10.1109/BIGCOMP.2016.7425800","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7425800","","Algorithm design and analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Minimization;Optimization;Robustness;Sparse matrices","data handling;image processing;image retrieval;sparse matrices","RSKP algorithm;data matrix;image recovery problems;low-rank matrix;matrix completion;robust and scalable MC with Kronecker product;sparse matrix","","","","17","","","18-20 Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this research, we map words into tables in the reverse direction to the text encoding, modify the AHC algorithm into the version where tables are given as its input, and apply the modified version of AHC to the word clustering task. In this research, we expect the better and more stable clustering performance, than the traditional version.

While in many applications, the minority instances actually represent the concept of interest (e.g., fraud in banking operations, abnormal cell in medical data, etc.), a classifier induced from an imbalanced data set is more likely to be biased towards the majority class and show very poor classification accuracy on the minority class. Despite extensive research efforts, imbalanced data classification remains one of the most challenging problems in data mining and machine learning, especially for multimedia data. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose an extended deep learning approach to achieve promising performance in classifying skewed multimedia data sets. Specifically, we investigate the integration of bootstrapping methods and a state-of-the-art deep learning approach, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with extensive empirical studies. Considering the fact that deep learning approaches such as CNNs are usually computationally expensive, we propose to feed low-level features to CNNs and prove its feasibility in achieving promising performance while saving a lot of training time.

Habituation here refers to changes in the user's profile and/or noise within it due to the user's familiarization with the device and software application. The results of this work show that habituation causes the user's touch profile to evolve significantly and irrevocably over time even after the user is familiar with the device and software application. This phenomenon considerably degrades classifier accuracy. We show that this effect can be best mitigated using approximately 300 most recent user inputs and retraining the classifier. The retrained classifier can be used with minimal increase in error rate on up to 75 new user inputs. This results in an error rate of 3.68% that sets the benchmark in this field for a realistic test setup.

The current state of the art methods based on image differencing are limited by the fact that for every real variable source the algorithm returns a large number of bogus “detections” caused by atmospheric effects and instrumental signatures coupled with imperfect image processing. Here we present a new approach to this problem inspired by recent advances in computer vision and train the machine to learn new features directly from pixel data. The training data set comes from the Palomar Transient Factory survey and consists of small images centered around transient candidates with known real/bogus classification. This set of high-dimensional vectors (~1000 features) is then transformed into a linear representation using the so called dictionary, an overcomplete feature set constructed separately for each class. The data vectors are well approximated with a small number of dictionary elements, i.e. the dictionary representation is sparse. We show how sparse representations can be used to construct informative features for any suitable machine learning classifier. Our top level classifier is based on the random forest algorithm (collections of decision trees) with input data vectors consisting of up to 6 computer vision features and 20 additional context features designed by subject domain experts. Machine-learned features alone provide only an approximate classification with a 20% missed detection rate at a fixed false positive rate of 1%. When automatically extracted features are appended to those constructed by humans, the rate of missed detections is reduced from 8% to about 4% at 1% false positive rate.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9558-8; POD:978-1-4673-9559-5","10.1109/AIPR.2015.7444552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7444552","Hebbian learning;astronomical data bases;catalogs;feature dictionaries;general;learned dictionaries;sparse approximations;stars;surveys;variables","Classification algorithms;Convergence;Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Transient analysis","computer vision;feature extraction;feature selection;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);vectors","Palomar Transient Factory survey;atmospheric effects;automated variability selection;bogus classification;computer vision;data streams;data vectors;dictionary elements;dictionary representation;feature set;high-dimensional vectors;image differencing;image processing;instrumental signatures;learned dictionaries;linear representation;machine learning classifier;pixel data;random forest algorithm;real classification;sparse representations;time-domain imaging surveys;variability extraction algorithms","","","","23","","","13-15 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Weeds have a great impact on the development of agricultural production and agricultural economy. The reproduction and spread of weeds are mainly dependent on weed seeds. So we want to find an efficient algorithm with robust and accurate classification of weed seeds, which has an important practical value and economic significance. PCA Network has been applied to image feature extraction and achieved fantastic effects. Here we propose a variant of PCA Network and apply it to the classification of weed seeds in agriculture. The difference between the proposed method and the original PCA Network lies in that we get L1 families of orthogonal filters rather than one family of orthogonal filters in the second stage of PCA. After using the PCA Network variant method to extract image features, we conduct an experiment to test the classification accuracy of weed seeds. The data sets contain 91 types of weed seeds. In the experiment we use a large margin classifier to construct a linear classifier, which is based on affine hulls. Next we use the features extracted from the test samples to examine the recognition accuracy rate. Experiment results show that the PCA Network variant method obtains good classification results and improves the recognition accuracy. In the data sets composed of 91 types of weed seeds, 45 arrives at 100% recognition rate of classification, and 90.96% average recognition rate. At the same time, our algorithm shows relatively higher robustness than the recognition of weed seeds images does. This algorithm improves the classification accuracy rate of weed seeds greatly and thus can be applied to the agricultural production practice.","","Electronic:978-9-8814-7680-7; POD:978-1-4673-9593-9","10.1109/APSIPA.2015.7415304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7415304","","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Filter banks;Histograms;Machine learning;Principal component analysis;Training","agriculture;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence)","PCA network;PCANet deep learning baseline;affine hulls;agricultural economy;agricultural production;large margin classifier;linear classifier;orthogonal filters;principal component analysis;weed seeds classification","","","","24","","","16-19 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

V2X communication has a more stringent requirement for QoS and transmission delay, especially for the road safety messages. The unnecessary handovers between two base stations in a short interval, so-called ping-pong effect, impact on the quality of communication seriously. So it is important to limit ping-pong effect in V2X communication. In this paper, we proposed a Joint Handover Decision (JHD) algorithm based on the characteristics that the target terminal connects with other devices around it in V2X communication, to improve the accuracy of handover and relieve the ping-pong effect. The JHD algorithm of target terminal is described by probability using Bayes Model in machine learning. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can decrease the ping-pong effect 33% to 87%, compared with the traditional handover algorithm.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0264-1; POD:978-1-5090-0265-8","10.1109/ICCVE.2015.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7447643","","Connected vehicles;Handover;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Vehicles","3G mobile communication;Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);quality of service;road safety;traffic engineering computing","3GPP;3rd Generation Partnership Project;Bayes Model;JHD algorithm;QoS;V2X communication;base stations;communication quality;handover accuracy improvement;joint handover decision algorithm;machine learning;ping-pong effect;probability;road safety messages;transmission delay;vehicle communication","","","","15","","","19-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The overall performance of an automated apnea detection scheme greatly depends of the choice of classifier. Most of the existing works focus on the feature extraction part. The effect of various classification models is poorly studied. In the present work, we employ statistical moment based features and Empirical Mode Decomposition to devise a feature extraction scheme. Furthermore, we study the performance of nine well-know classifiers for this feature extraction scheme- naive bayes, kNN, neural network, AdaBoost, Bagging, random forest, extreme learning machine (ELM), discriminant analysis and restricted boltzmann machine. The optimal choice of parameters of each of the classifiers is also studied.

It is driven by big visual data with rich annotations. This paper contributes a large-scale object attribute database that contains rich attribute annotations (over 300 attributes) for ~180k samples and 494 object classes. Based on the ImageNet object detection dataset, it annotates the rotation, viewpoint, object part location, part occlusion, part existence, common attributes, and class-specific attributes. Then we use this dataset to train deep representations and extensively evaluate how these attributes are useful on the general object detection task. In order to make better use of the attribute annotations, a deep learning scheme is proposed by modeling the relationship of attributes and hierarchically clustering them into semantically meaningful mixture types. Experimental results show that the attributes are helpful in learning better features and improving the object detection accuracy by 2.6% in mAP on the ILSVRC 2014 object detection dataset and 2.4% in mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 object detection dataset.

In an example of telecom providers, the key business data (e.g., billing information) is maintained in database systems whereas the huge amount of log data is on HDFS with Hive. How to provide insightful analytics on such data becomes a challenging task. Traditional enterprise data warehouse systems with careful database design cannot meet the agile requirement of data scientists to arbitrarily access any useful data (such as the log data). In this paper, we propose a unified computation engine for big data analytics, namely Octopus, to effectively and efficiently bridge data scientists and data warehouse. First, Octopus designs a SQL-alike approach to unify both database queries and machine learning algorithms. Next, Octopus optimizes the running time of such big data analytic tasks by scheduling optimal subtasks to backend systems. A proof-of-concept prototype of Octopus successfully verifies that Octopus can achieve much faster running time than Spark. For example, Octopus outperforms the recent Spark 1.4.0 by 4.58× faster running time to process a complex analytic task, and 5.25× to process a simple aggregation query.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5696-3; POD:978-1-5090-0340-2","10.1109/BDC.2015.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7406332","Apache Spark;Big Data;Hybrid Computation Engine","Big data;Data warehouses;Databases;Machine learning algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Optimization;Sparse matrices","Big Data;business data processing;data analysis;data warehouses;database management systems;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing","HDFS;Hive;Octopus design;SQL-alike approach;Spark;backend system;big data analytics;big data system;billing information;business data;data scientist;database design;database query;database system;enterprise data warehouse system;log data;machine learning algorithm;telecom provider;unified computation engine","","","","7","","","7-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the constrain of short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the extraction of the audio frequency domain features, as the essential work among the audio event classification, still have some difficulty when conducted on a big audio frame. The traditional concatenation method of feature vector for the successive audio windows in one big audio frame is not perfect for the information redundancy in the low level audio representations. However the temporal information is very important in the audio event classification. In this paper, we try to capture the underlying temporal information in the audio event using the Deep Belief Network (DBN). Here the feature is extracted on a long time span. For the clear description, we call this kind of audio block in our method as audio unit rather than audio frame. There are mainly two contributions in this paper. First we segment the audio into units with different sizes and conduct an evaluation about the classification performance of different features on different unit sizes, including the traditional features and the DBN features. Second we present a method to merge audio features learned from multi-scale audio units to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The classifier based on the merged DBN features outperforms other classifiers which are only based on the DBN features before merging or the traditional features respectively.","","CD-ROM:978-1-5090-0187-3; Electronic:978-1-5090-0188-0; POD:978-1-5090-0189-7","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2015.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7415846","Deep Belief Network;audio event classification;audio temporal information;multi-scale representations","Feature extraction;Frequency-domain analysis;Machine learning;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Multimedia communication;Neurons;Speech recognition","Fourier transforms;audio signal processing;belief networks;feature extraction;signal classification;signal representation;support vector machines;surveillance","DBN features;STFT;SVM classifier;audio event classification;audio frequency domain features extraction;audio representations;big audio frame;capture temporal information;deep belief network;short-time Fourier transform;support vector machine classifier;surveillance systems","","","","14","","","23-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is often a great challenge for traditional recommender systems to learn representative features of both users and images in large social networks, in particular, social curation networks, which are characterized as the extremely sparse links between users and images, and the extremely diverse visual contents of images. To address the challenges, we propose a novel deep model which learns the unified feature representations for both users and images. This is done by transforming the heterogeneous user-image networks into homogeneous low-dimensional representations, which facilitate a recommender to trivially recommend images to users by feature similarity. We also develop a fast online algorithm that can be easily scaled up to large networks in an asynchronously parallel way.

Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. One central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To this end, we formulate Conditional Random Fields with Gaussian pairwise potentials and mean-field approximate inference as Recurrent Neural Networks. This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. We apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8391-2; POD:978-1-4673-8392-9","10.1109/ICCV.2015.179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410536","","Computer vision;Graphical models;Image segmentation;Labeling;Machine learning;Semantics;Training","Gaussian processes;backpropagation;image segmentation;neural nets;probability;random processes","CNN;CRF;Gaussian pairwise potential;back-propagation algorithm;conditional random field;convolutional neural network;deep learning technique;image understanding;mean-field approximate inference;pixel-level labelling task;probabilistic graphical modelling;recurrent neural network;semantic image segmentation","","117","","58","","","7-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although event patterns (decision rules) can be provided by experts in simplistic scenarios, the huge amount of sensor data makes this unfeasible. The main purpose of the underlying paper is replacing manual identification of event patterns.

Although a variety of powerful algorithms have been presented in the past few years, most of them usually focus on designing hand-crafted features and learning metrics either individually or sequentially. Different from previous works, we formulate a unified deep ranking framework that jointly tackles both of these key components to maximize their strengths. We start from the principle that the correct match of the probe image should be positioned in the top rank within the whole gallery set. An effective learning-to-rank algorithm is proposed to minimize the cost corresponding to the ranking disorders of the gallery. The ranking model is solved with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that builds the relation between input image pairs and their similarity scores through joint representation learning directly from raw image pixels. The proposed framework allows us to get rid of feature engineering and does not rely on any assumption. An extensive comparative evaluation is given, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art approaches, including both traditional and CNN-based methods on the challenging VIPeR, CUHK-01, and CAVIAR4REID datasets.

The proposed two-stage Domain Knowledge based Fuzzy Information System (DKFIS) improves the prediction accuracy attained by ANFIS alone. The proposed framework has been implemented on a noisy and incomplete dataset acquired from a hydrocarbon field located at western part of India. Here, oil saturation has been predicted from four different well logs i.e. gamma ray, resistivity, density, and clay volume. In the first stage, depending on zero or near zero and non-zero oil saturation levels the input vector is classified into two classes (Class 0 and Class 1) using SVM. The classification results have been further fine-tuned applying expert knowledge based on the relationship among predictor variables i.e. well logs and target variable - oil saturation. Second, an ANFIS is designed to predict non-zero (Class 1) oil saturation values from predictor logs. The predicted output has been further refined based on expert knowledge. It is apparent from the experimental results that the expert intervention with qualitative judgment at each stage has rendered the prediction into the feasible and realistic ranges. The performance analysis of the prediction in terms of four performance metrics such as correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), and absolute error mean (AEM), scatter index (SI) has established DKFIS as a useful tool for reservoir characterization.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7399-9; POD:978-1-4673-7400-2","10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443661","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7443661","Adaptive Neurofuzzy Inference System (ANFIS);Domain Knowledge based Fuzzy Information System (DKFIS);Support Vector Machine (SVM);g-metric means;knowledge base;performance metrics;qualitative learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Conductivity;Knowledge based systems;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Reservoirs;Support vector machines","fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;geophysics computing;hydrocarbon reservoirs;learning (artificial intelligence);oil technology;pattern classification;support vector machines;well logging","AEM;ANFIS;CC;DKFIS;RMSE;SI;SVM;absolute error mean;adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system;correlation coefficient;hybrid learning system;hydrocarbon field;nonzero oil saturation level prediction;predictor logs;predictor variables;reservoir characterization;root mean square error;scatter index;support vector machines;two-stage domain knowledge based fuzzy information system;well logs","","","","24","","","17-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two mostly widely used techniques are Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Part Average Testing (PAT), whose capabilities to capture complex correlation between test measurements and the underlying IC's physical and electrical properties are, however, limited. Based on recent progress on machine learning, this paper proposes a novel deep learning based method for adaptive test. Compared to most machine learning techniques, deep learning has the distinctive advantage of being able to capture the underlying key features automatically from data without manual intervention. In this paper, we start from a trained deep neuron network (DNN) with a much higher accuracy than the conventional test flow for the pass and fail prediction. We further develop two novel applications by leveraging the features learned from DNN: one to enable partial testing, i.e., make decisions on pass and fail without finishing the entire test flow, and two to enable dynamic test ordering, i.e., changing the sequence of tests adaptively. Experiment results show significant improvement on the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed method.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9569-4; POD:978-1-4673-9570-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2016.7428100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7428100","","Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Integrated circuits;Machine learning;Neurons;Semiconductor device measurement;Testing","integrated circuit testing;integrated circuit yield;learning (artificial intelligence)","IC;adaptive testing;deep learning hidden features;deep neuron network;integrated circuits;machine learning techniques;manufacturing test cost;part average testing;product quality;product yield;statistical process control","","","","16","","","25-28 Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, it is expected that this form of mobility will serve as an effective mode of transport in areas lacking in good public transport systems. For hard-link-type mobility to be effective, it is desirable that the load on the coupling device be as low as possible. Therefore, we have previously proposed a vehicle control system that reduces the load acting on the device. However, this system has been evaluated using only velocity data.

These daily horoscopes are well suited for the task of sentiment analysis as they have a high percentage of strong sentiment bearing sentences. This work deals with sentiment analysis of Bengali daily horoscope. A corpus of 6000 sentences is created by crawling through the website of a leading Bengali newspaper's daily horoscope section. Each sentence is annotated with polarity (positive or negative) by a team of three independent annotators. A lexicon of 58 stop words is also created from the frequently occurring words in the corpus. A comparative analysis of five well known classification algorithms namely Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree and Random Forest is done. For each classification algorithm three different input features (unigram, bigram and trigram presence) are experimented with. Stop word removal and feature selection using information gain metric are also used.

However, existing approaches do not allow for the number of latent components (features) to be automatically inferred from the data in an unsupervised manner. This is a significant disadvantage of the state-of-the-art, as it results in considerable burden imposed on researchers and practitioners, who must resort to tedious cross-validation procedures to obtain the optimal number of latent features. To resolve these issues, in this paper we introduce a convolutional nonparametric Bayesian sparse ICA architecture for overcomplete feature learning from high-dimensional data. Our method utilizes an Indian buffet process prior to facilitate inference of the appropriate number of latent features under a hybrid variational inference algorithm, scalable to massive datasets. As we show, our model can be naturally used to obtain deep unsupervised hierarchical feature extractors, by greedily stacking successive model layers, similar to existing approaches. In addition, inference for this model is completely heuristics-free, thus, it obviates the need of tedious parameter tuning, which is a major challenge most deep learning approaches are faced with. We evaluate our method on several action recognition benchmarks, and exhibit its advantages over the state-of-the-art.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8391-2; POD:978-1-4673-8392-9","10.1109/ICCV.2015.321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410678","","Adaptation models;Bayes methods;Data models;Feature extraction;Inference algorithms;Machine learning;Training","Bayes methods;convolution;feature extraction;image recognition;independent component analysis","Indian buffet process;action recognition benchmarks;convolutional formulations;convolutional nonparametric Bayesian sparse ICA architecture;cross-validation procedures;deep learning;deep unsupervised hierarchical feature extractors;heuristics-free;high-dimensional data;hybrid variational inference algorithm;massive datasets;nonparametric Bayesian approach;overcomplete feature learning;parameter tuning;stacked convolutional independent component analysis;successive model layers;unsupervised feature learning algorithms","","","","37","","","7-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to properly perform the embedding for object recognition in which graph nodes represent image features and graph edges show the relations between the features, we first use a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, which obtains similar sets of features from images taken from close view points. Given a set of such features, we then perform their consistent ordering based on the local histogram around each feature.

For image super-resolution, several models based on deep neural networks have been recently proposed and attained superior performance that overshadows all previous handcrafted models. The question then arises whether large-capacity and data-driven models have become the dominant solution to the ill-posed super-resolution problem. In this paper, we argue that domain expertise represented by the conventional sparse coding model is still valuable, and it can be combined with the key ingredients of deep learning to achieve further improved results. We show that a sparse coding model particularly designed for super-resolution can be incarnated as a neural network, and trained in a cascaded structure from end to end. The interpretation of the network based on sparse coding leads to much more efficient and effective training, as well as a reduced model size.

In this work, we propose a regression model with ConvNets that achieves robustness to such outliers by minimizing Tukey's biweight function, an M-estimator robust to outliers, as the loss function for the ConvNet. In addition to the robust loss, we introduce a coarse-to-fine model, which processes input images of progressively higher resolutions for improving the accuracy of the regressed values. In our experiments, we demonstrate faster convergence and better generalization of our robust loss function for the tasks of human pose estimation and age estimation from face images.

We propose a novel deep learning framework for attribute prediction in the wild. It cascades two CNNs, LNet and ANet, which are fine-tuned jointly with attribute tags, but pre-trained differently. LNet is pre-trained by massive general object categories for face localization, while ANet is pre-trained by massive face identities for attribute prediction. This framework not only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin, but also reveals valuable facts on learning face representation. (1) It shows how the performances of face localization (LNet) and attribute prediction (ANet) can be improved by different pre-training strategies. (2) It reveals that although the filters of LNet are fine-tuned only with image-level attribute tags, their response maps over entire images have strong indication of face locations. This fact enables training LNet for face localization with only image-level annotations, but without face bounding boxes or landmarks, which are required by all attribute recognition works. (3) It also demonstrates that the high-level hidden neurons of ANet automatically discover semantic concepts after pre-training with massive face identities, and such concepts are significantly enriched after fine-tuning with attribute tags.

The effect of users friends tastes is modeled using a trust model which is defined based on importance (i.e., centrality) and similarity between users. Similarity is modeled using Vector Space Similarity (VSS) algorithm and centrality is quantified using two different centrality measures (degree and eigen-vector centrality). To validate the proposed method, rating estimation is performed on the Epinions dataset.

In this paper, we propose PhaseFi, a fingerprinting system for indoor localization with calibrated channel state information (CSI) phase information. In PhaseFi, the raw phase information is first extracted from the multiple antennas and multiple subcarriers of the IEEE 802.11n network interface card (NIC) by accessing the modified driver. Then a linear transform is used to extract the calibrated phase information, which is proven to have a bounded variance. For the offline stage, we design a deep network with three hidden layers to train the calibrated phase data, and employ weights to represent fingerprints. A greedy learning algorithm is incorporated to train the weights layer-by-layer to reduce computational complexity, where a sub-network between two continuous layers forms a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). In the online stage, we use a probabilistic method based on the radial basis function (RBF) for online location estimation. The proposed PhaseFi scheme is implemented and validated with intensive experiments in two representation indoor environments.

The success of these deep learning methods mostly relies on an enormous volume of labeled training samples to learn a huge number of parameters in a network; therefore, understanding the generalization ability of a learned deep network cannot be overlooked, especially when restricted to a small training set, which is the case for many applications. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning objective formulation that unifies both the classification and metric learning criteria. We then introduce a geometry-aware deep transform to enable a non-linear discriminative and robust feature transform, which shows competitive performance on small training sets for both synthetic and real-world data. We further support the proposed framework with a formal (K, ϵ)-robustness analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8391-2; POD:978-1-4673-8392-9","10.1109/ICCV.2015.471","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410828","","Machine learning;Measurement;Neural networks;Robustness;Testing;Training;Transforms","feature extraction;generalisation (artificial intelligence);geometry;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);transforms","deep learning methods;deep learning objective formulation;deep learning structures;formal (K,ϵ)-robustness analysis;generalization ability;geometry-aware deep transform;metric learning criteria;nonlinear discriminative transform;robust feature transform","","3","","18","","","7-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each group is formed with the data that are similar in some parametric values and dissimilar compared to data of other groups. Active research is being in progress with data clustering in several fields such as statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning. This paper proposes a data clustering technique based on quad tree. The current researchers established an algorithm, which is inspired by the construction and behavior of quad tree data structure. In its initiation, the algorithm has been tested thoroughly on synthetic data. The different set of results is found to be very encouraging for future investigation. The algorithm also shows nice execution time bound.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-6734-9; Electronic:978-1-4673-6735-6; POD:978-1-4673-6736-3","10.1109/ICRCICN.2015.7434228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7434228","Data clustering;execution time;quad tree","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Curve fitting;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms","pattern clustering;quadtrees","machine learning;pattern recognition;quad tree based data clustering technique;quad tree data structure","","","","8","","","20-22 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can, in the worst case, even make decentralized learning infeasible. Dimension reduction is a key technique to compress data and to obtain small models. In this paper, we propose a number of robust and efficient decentralized approaches to dimension reduction in the system model where each network node holds only one data record. These algorithms build on searching for good random projections. We present a thorough experimental comparison of the proposed algorithms and compare them with a variant of distributed singular value decomposition (SVD), a state-of-the-art algorithm for dimension reduction. We base our experiments on a trace of real mobile phone usage. We conclude that our method based on selecting good random projections is preferable and provides good quality results when the output is required on a very short timescale, within tens of minutes. We also present a hybrid method that combines the advantages of random projections and SVD. We demonstrate that the hybrid method offers good performance over all timescales.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8776-7; POD:978-1-4673-8777-4","10.1109/PDP.2016.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7445364","dimension reduction;distributed data mining;gossip","Approximation algorithms;Covariance matrices;Data models;Machine learning algorithms;Peer-to-peer computing;Principal component analysis;Training","data compression;data mining;mobile computing;singular value decomposition","collaborative mobile gossip learning;data compression;decentralized learning algorithms;dimension reduction methods;distributed data mining;distributed singular value decomposition;mobile phone usage","","","","22","","","17-19 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important preprocessing step of microblog text mining is to convert natural language texts into proper numerical representations. Due to the short-length characteristic, finding proper representations of microblog texts is nontrivial. In this paper, we propose to build deep network-based models to learn low-dimensional representations of microblog texts. The proposed models take advantage of the semantic relatedness derived from two types of microblog-specific information, namely the retweet relationship and hashtags. Experiment results show that the deep models perform better than traditional dimensionality reduction methods such as latent semantic analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation topic model, and the use of microblog-specific information can help to learn better representations.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7591-4; POD:978-1-4799-7592-1","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2015.7418164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7418164","autoencoder;deep learning;dimensionality reduction;microblog mining;text representation","Conferences;Information processing;Machine learning;Semantics;Tagging;Training;Twitter","data mining;data reduction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","deep learning;deep network-based models;hashtags;large volume textual data mining;low-dimensional representations;microblog dimensionality reduction;microblog text mining;microblog-specific information;microblogging services;natural language texts;numerical representations;retweet relationship;semantic relatedness;short-length characteristic","","","","15","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
