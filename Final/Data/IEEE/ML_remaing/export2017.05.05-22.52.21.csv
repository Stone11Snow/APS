As a general MIL framework, Diverse Density (DD) provides a way to learn those ambiguous features by maxmising the DD estimator, and the maximum of DD estimator is called a concept. However, modeling and finding multiple concepts is often difficult especially without prior knowledge of concept number, i.e., every positive bag may contain multiple coexistent and heterogeneous concepts but we do not know how many concepts exist. In this work, we present a new approach to find multiple concepts of DD by using an supervised mean shift algorithm. Unlike classic mean shift (an unsupervised clustering algorithm), our approach for the first time introduces the class label to feature point and each point differently contributes the mean shift iterations according to its label and position. A feature point derives from an MIL instance and takes corresponding bag label. Our supervised mean shift starts from positive points and converges to the local maxima that are close to the positive points and far away from the negative points. Experiments qualitatively indicate that our approach has better properties than other DD methods.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4271-3; POD:978-1-4244-8816-2","10.1109/DICTA.2010.111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5692634","MIL;Mean shift;diverse density;supervised","Bandwidth;Clustering algorithms;Convergence;Gaussian distribution;Kernel;Machine learning;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","MIL instance;ambiguous features;classic mean shift;diverse density framework;general MIL framework;heterogeneous concepts;machine learning;mean shift iteration;multiple coexistent concepts;multiple instance learning;multiple-instance learning;supervised mean shift algorithm;unsupervised clustering","","0","","16","","","1-3 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, application traffic on backbone is in general hard to be identified because of the amount of traffic volume, asymmetric nature of the route, and difficulty of capturing full payload. In this paper, we present our preliminary results of the basic ability and limitation of four well-known flow identification algorithms (port-based heuristics and payload-based one) applied to packet trace called MAWI trace measured at a trans-pacific link. First, we show that the identification ratio of the payload-based algorithms is 40-60% in flow level, however the accuracy of the identification in the payload-based algorithms strongly depends on the algorithm and the definition of the rules themselves. Next, we found that only 3% of the traffic is commonly identified by the payload-based algorithms when we apply them to unknown traffic reported by the port-based heuristics. Finally, we evaluate the dependency of the flow size on the identification ratio. Those results emphasize the need for a more accurate and available identification algorithm.","2165-9605;21659605","Electronic:978-1-4244-8909-1; POD:978-1-4244-8910-7; USB:978-1-4244-8908-4","10.1109/CNSM.2010.5691234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5691234","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Software","Internet;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic","MAWI trace;backbone traffic;flow identification algorithm;network management;payload based one;port based heuristic;traffic volume;trans pacific link","","0","","13","","","25-29 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"The Necessity of Meta Bias in Search Algorithms","J. R. Woodward","Sch. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK","2010 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Software Engineering","20101230","2010","","","1","4","Bias is necessary for learning, and is a probability over a search space. This is usually introduced implicitly by the designer of a search algorithm, for example by designing a new search operator. This bias is does not change; each time a stochastic search algorithm is executed it will give a different answer. However, if executed repeated it will give the same solution on average. In other words, the bias is static (even if we include a self adaptive component to the search algorithm). One desirable property of search algorithms is that they converge (i.e. given enough time they will eventually reach the global optima). In terms of bias, this means that there is a non-zero probability of visiting each item in the search space. Search algorithms are intended to be reused on many instances of a problem. These instances can be consider to be drawn from a probability distribution. In other words, a search algorithm and problem class can both be viewed as probability distributions over the search space. If the bias of a search algorithm does not match the bias of a problem class, it will under perform, if however, they do match, it will perform well. Therefore we need some mechanism of altering the initial bias of the search algorithm to coincide with that of the problem class. This mechanism can be realized by a meta level which alters the bias of the base level. In other words, if a search algorithm is to be applied to many instances of a problem, then meta bias is necessary. This implies that convergence at the meta level means a search algorithm shift its bias to any probability distribution. Additionally, shifting bias is equivalent to automating the design of search algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5392-4; POD:978-1-4244-5391-7","10.1109/CISE.2010.5677120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677120","","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Genetic programming;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Probability distribution;Search problems","learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;statistical distributions","machine learning;meta bias;probability distribution;search algorithm;search operator;search space","","2","","14","","","10-12 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The data in a blog may be updated frequently by its owner, making the whole blogosphere become very large during a short period of time. It can be very expensive to deal with such huge amount of data using those traditional methods. Meanwhile, few blogs in the blogosphere can be identified as members of a specify community clearly from their own characters, while we have to judge most blogs depending on the relationship with other neighboring blogs using centrality metrics. Recently, a new method that combines active learning and semi-supervised learning gives quite a good performance on improving the speed and accuracy of machine learning on large scale of data. In this paper, we employ this method to solve the community clustering problem with a vast and complex data set. We try to show that this method really does a better job on labeling and clustering large scale of data by comparing the result with the one achieved in the traditional way.

However, there is no equivalent result to the Neyman-Pearson lemma when the likelihoods are unknown, and we are given a training dataset. In this brief, we explore two alternatives.

The earlier metric learning algorithms mostly focus on finding distance metric from sample vectors. However, when dealing with images, the existing approaches often encounter high computational cost due to huge dimensionality of image vector space and instability in performance caused by distortion effect of image vectorization. This paper proposes a new technique coined Local Image Distance Metric Learning(LIDML) for image distance measurement. LIDML learns an appropriate distance metric for a novel image distance by optimizing local compactness and local separability. In LIDML, the size of distance metric is comparatively small and the model processes a closed-form solution via eigen-decomposition, both of which make LIDML fairly efficient. The experimental results on image classification demonstrate effectiveness of our method, and also show that LIDML can handle expensive computation difficulty case that hardly be handled satisfactorily by previous methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7210-9; POD:978-1-4244-7209-3","10.1109/CCPR.2010.5659195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5659195","","Accuracy;Face;Machine learning;Measurement;Principal component analysis;Silicon;Training","image classification;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);vectors","distortion effect;eigen-decomposition;image classification;image distance measurement;image vector space;image vectorization;local compactness;local image distance metric learning;local separability;machine learning;pattern recognition","","8","","16","","","21-23 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose to integrate extractive summarization techniques into the retrieval process so as to improve the informativeness of a verbose query exemplar. The original query exemplar is first divided into several sub-queries or sentences. To construct a new concise query exemplar, summarization techniques are then employed to select a salient subset of sub-queries.

It uses many regions to model the background and foreground and a random forest for classification. The objective is to overcome the limitations of more holistic approaches that try to recognise people as a single region with the consequential need to segment each person as one representation. Attributes of each blob, their relationships and variation over video frames are argued to be useful features for discrimination. In this paper the attributes of each blob are considered as a first step in the recognition process. We evaluate our approach through a comparison of three state of the art classifiers: Bagging, Adaboost and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), with the Random Forest (RF) using 10 fold cross validation. A detailed statistical analysis shows that the random forest classifier is more accurate compared to the other methods in terms of discrimination between regions describing people and those of the background.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4271-3; POD:978-1-4244-8816-2","10.1109/DICTA.2010.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5692589","evaluation;part-based;random forest;recognition;region growing;segmentation","Accuracy;Bagging;Classification tree analysis;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Shape;Training","image classification;image representation;image segmentation;multilayer perceptrons;statistical analysis;video signal processing","Adaboost;Bagging;discriminative part-based approach;multilayer perceptron;part based recognition;pedestrians;people recognition;person segmention;random forest classifier;random forests;statistical analysis","","0","","35","","","1-3 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using a dataset with 58 H&E stained breast cancer biopsy images, we find that the convolutional networks, with 3 hidden layers and 8 feature maps per hidden layer, provide superior performance to other pixel classification methods including FLDA and SVM. We also show two important properties of the convolutional networks as a segmentation method. First, as a machine learning approach, the convolution networks encode enough high-level domain-specific knowledge into the final segmentation strategy by learning the training data. Second, the convolutional networks can use appropriate amount of context information in segmenting by optimizing the weights of the filters in the networks through the learning process.

Based on this, this paper proposes a new weighted clustering approach based on rough set similarity models, as well as a class purification approach based on information theory. First, weights of each property characteristic are initialized to 1, form primary equivalent classes with rough set similarity models, and then evaluate these property characteristics according to the information entropy theory, repeated weighted clustering are performed on each property with their entropy values, and finally obtain pattern classes satisfying clustering requirements.

But when choosing the best attribute using variable precision rough set, these algorithms still have the shortages in ID3. That is, these algorithms also tend to choose the attribute with more attribute values as the splitting node, but this attribute is often not the best attribute. Therefore, this paper proposes a new attribute selection criterion. When the algorithm selects a new attribute, not only the number of attribute values in the current node, but also the size of variable precision explicit region in the lower node is taken into consideration. In other words, the size of variable precision explicit region of attributes in two levels of the decision tree is used. With the new approach to select attributes, the proposed algorithm overcomes the lack of ID3 algorithm and also has the advantages of variable precision rough set. Comparison between the present method and the existing methods based on variable precision rough set shows that the improved algorithm (MVPRSDT) has better classification performance.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4225-6; POD:978-1-4244-8432-4","10.1109/AICI.2010.270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657000","confidence;decision tree;match;rough set;variable precision rough set","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Classification tree analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Noise;Prediction algorithms","decision trees;pattern classification;rough set theory","attribute selection criterion;decision tree;optimization;tree classification;variable precision rough set","","0","","10","","","23-24 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We evaluate the performance of ICGA-PSO-ELM and compare our results with existing methods in the literature. An investigation into the functions of the selected genes, using a systems biology approach, revealed that many of the identified genes are involved in cell signaling and proliferation. An analysis of these gene sets shows a larger representation of genes that encode secreted proteins than found in randomly selected gene sets. Secreted proteins constitute a major means by which cells interact with their surroundings. Mounting biological evidence has identified the tumor microenvironment as a critical factor that determines tumor survival and growth. Thus, the genes identified by this study that encode secreted proteins might provide important insights to the nature of the critical biological features in the microenvironment of each tumor type that allow these cells to thrive and proliferate.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416676","Biology and genetics;classifier design and evaluation;feature evaluation and selection;neural nets.","Biological information theory;Cancer;Cells (biology);Encoding;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Neoplasms;Neural networks;Particle swarm optimization;Proteins","bioinformatics;cancer;genetic algorithms;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;proteins;tumours","ICGA-PSO-ELM approach;cell proliferation;cell signaling;integer-coded genetic algorithm;multiclass cancer classification;neural-network-based extreme learning machine gene selection;particle swarm optimization;reduced gene sets;secreted proteins encoding;systems biology;tumor growth;tumor survival","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Regulatory Networks;Humans;Neoplasm Proteins;Neoplasms;Pattern Recognition, Automated","42","","46","","20100218","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The standard algorithm for some of these methods provides a non-probabilistic, hard decision as output. For those methods, posterior class probability estimates were approximated by fitting a sigmoid function to the classifier predictions. To perform multi-class classification, a one-versus-all approach was used. The different methods were compared using hyperspectral data acquired from ore-bearing rocks under different environmental conditions.

The idea of the first method is based on relating the response of the classifier with the response obtained by a random guessing. The measure of competence reflects this relation and rates the classifier with respect to the random guessing in a continuous manner. In the second method, first a probabilistic reference classifier (PRC) is constructed which, on average, acts like the classifier evaluated. Next the competence of the classifier evaluated is calculated as the probability of correct classification of the respective PRC. Two multiclassifier systems (MCS) were developed using proposed measures of competence in a dynamic fashion. The performance of proposed MCS's were compared against six multiple classifier systems using six databases taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Ludmila Kuncheva Collection.

There has, however, been little done in the research community to try to use such resources to advance our understanding of perceived video quality. The problem is the fact that it is not easy to obtain the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), a standard measure of the perceived video quality, for more than a handful of videos. The paper presents an approach to determining the quality of a relatively large number of videos obtained randomly from YouTube<sup>tm</sup>. Several measures related to motion, saliency and coding artifacts are calculated for the frames of the video. Programmable graphics hardware is used to perform clustering: first, to create an artifacts-related signature of each video; then, to cluster the videos according to their signatures. To obtain an estimate for the video quality, MOS is obtained for representative videos, closest to the cluster centers. This is then used as an estimate of the quality of all other videos in the cluster.

In this paper we introduce GPSvas (GPS Visual Analytics System), a system that detects anomalies in GPS data using the approach of visual analytics: a conditional random field (CRF) model is used as the machine learning component for anomaly detection in streaming GPS traces. A visualization component and an interactive user interface are built to visualize the data stream, display significant analysis results (i.e., anomalies or uncertain predications) and hidden information extracted by the anomaly detection model, which enable human experts to observe the real-time data behavior and gain insights into the data flow.

This capability has been integrated into the DisService peer-to-peer information dissemination system, which opportunistically exploits any available connectivity to address the challenging environment. The extended system, called DisServicePro (for Proactive) predicts the information needs of edge users using their mission description, including the routes that users may take as part of the mission. DisServicePro extends the capabilities of DisService by efficiently and proactively disseminating information to the edge nodes by means of replication and forwarding policies. The proactive behavior is the result of the integration of policies and a distributed learning algorithm that takes into account the history of previously requested information, along with the characteristics of the target nodes and the mission. As new information becomes available, DisServicePro matches it against the mission profile and pushes relevant information to the edge nodes.

Active Cost-sensitive Learning (ACL) is proposed to solve the above two class-imbalanced problems in this paper. Margin sampling, one step of ACL algorithm, is used to select an informative instance from unlabeled instances. Cost-sensitive support vector machine (CSVM), the other step of ACL algorithm, is trained to predict the class label with minimum expected cost for an unlabeled instance.

Occurrence of arousals results in fragmented sleep, being one of the most important causes of daytime sleepiness among sleep disorders. Detection of arousals requires a polysomnographic (PSG) recording to be made during the patient's sleep. The resulting PSG is then analyzed offline by the physician. This is a time-consuming task, hence, automation of this process is pursued. The analysis, which involves the correlation of various events in time occurring among the different channels, in conjunction with the complexity of the related biomedical signals, makes this task also difficult to achieve in the computer algorithm. In this paper, we present a method for the detection of EEG arousals working on multichannel PSGs. The algorithm detects arousals using the information available through two EEG channels and the electromyography. A signal-processing technique is first proposed for the analysis of biomedical signals and extraction of relevant information. Individual events are detected from the signals and subsequently are related in time. Finally, a classification phase carries out the final decision on the presence of the event. Classifiers based on Fisher's linear and quadratic discriminants, support vector machines and artificial neural networks are compared at this phase.

We show that both discriminative motif finding and the hierarchical structure improve localization prediction on a benchmark data set of yeast proteins. The motifs identified can be mapped to known targeting motifs and they are more conserved than the average protein sequence. Using our motif-based predictions, we can identify potential annotation errors in public databases for the location of some of the proteins. A software implementation and the data set described in this paper are available from http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/software/2009_TCBB_motif/.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2009.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374366","Hidden Markov models;discriminative motif finding;maximal mutual information estimate;protein localization.","Bioinformatics;Biomedical engineering;Cells (biology);Computational biology;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Proteins;Sequences;Terrorism;USA Councils","bioinformatics;cellular biophysics;hidden Markov models;physiological models;proteins;proteomics","discriminative motif finding;hidden Markov models;protein sequence;protein sorting;protein subcellular localization;protein targeting;sequence information","Algorithms;Amino Acid Motifs;Computational Biology;Databases, Protein;Fungal Proteins;Markov Chains;Protein Sorting Signals;Proteins;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Analysis, Protein","11","","46","","20100108","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, they may produce different results in terms of the number of conflicting records in a granulized dataset. In Wu's research, the data inconsistency has been found significant in granulized datasets by using EWI. Following this finding, our research conducts an experiment to examine and compare the performance of utilized EWI and EFI. Eighteen continuous datasets are examined. The TCRM model that is introduced by Wu, embedding a technique of database structured query language is utilized to efficiently derive results. Experimental results obtained indicate that (1) of 18 datasets that were examined, 7 were not recognized via EWI while 8 via EFI, implying that almost 40% of the granulized datasets contained conflicting data; (2) comparatively, we did not find a notable difference between EWI and EFI with respect to their granulization performance, and (3) no remarkable tendency of conflicting data production against dataset size, the number of attributes, and the number of classes was found.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7297-0; POD:978-1-4244-7295-6","10.1109/ICCIE.2010.5668394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5668394","Data mining;conflicting data;granulation","Conferences;Data mining;Database languages;Databases;Machine learning;Presses","database management systems;query languages","continuous database;data inconsistency;database structured query language;equal frequency interval;equal width interval;granulized datasets;knowledge discovery in databases","","0","","26","","","25-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of the existence of several approaches, much effort is still required to increase the efficiency of the learning process. This study introduces a new method for the fuzzy-rule evolution that forms an expert system knowledge: the knowledge acquisition with a swarm-intelligence approach (KASIA). Specifically, this strategy is based on the use of particle-swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain the antecedents, consequences, and connectives of the rules. To test the feasibility of the suggested method, the inverted-pendulum problem is studied, and results are compared for two of the most extensively used methodologies in machine learning: the genetic-based Pittsburgh approach and the Q-learning-based strategy, i.e., state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA). Moreover, KASIA is analyzed as a learning strategy in fuzzy-rule-based metascheduler design for grid computing, and performance is compared with other scheduling strategies based on genetic learning and existing scheduling approaches, i.e., EASY-backfilling and ESG+local periodical search. To be more precise, simulation results prove the fact that the proposed strategy outperforms classical learning approaches in terms of final results and computational effort. Furthermore, the main advantage is the capability to control convergence and its simplicity.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2062525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5535078","Genetic fuzzy systems;grid computing;knowledge acquisition;reinforcement learning;swarm intelligence","Connectors;Convergence;Expert systems;Fuzzy systems;Genetics;Hybrid intelligent systems;Knowledge acquisition;Knowledge based systems;Machine learning;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Performance analysis;Processor scheduling;Testing","fuzzy systems;grid computing;knowledge acquisition;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pendulums","Q-learning;expert system knowledge;fuzzy rule based metascheduler design;fuzzy rule based system;fuzzy rule evolution;genetic learning;genetic-based Pittsburgh approach;grid computing;inverted pendulum problem;knowledge acquisition;machine learning process;particle swarm optimization;scheduling strategy;swarm intelligence approach","","32","","53","","20100803","Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Combining active learning with a semi-supervised learning algorithm that uses Gaussian field and harmonic functions was suggested recently. This work showed that empirical risk minimization (ERM) could find the next instance to label effectively, but the computation time consumption with ERM was large. In the case where the data is graphical in nature, we can leverage the graph topological analysis to rapidly select instances that are likely to be good candidates for labeling. This paper describes a novel approach of using clustering coefficient metric to identify the best instance next to label. We experiment on the 20 newsgroups dataset with three binary classification tasks, the results show that clustering coefficient strategy has similar performance to ERM with less time consumption.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6793-8; POD:978-1-4244-6791-4","10.1109/ISKE.2010.5680858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680858","active learning;clustering coefficient;empirical risk minimization;semi-supervised learning;uncertainty","Accuracy;Harmonic analysis;Learning;Machine learning;Measurement;Risk management;Uncertainty","Gaussian processes;graph theory;harmonic analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;risk analysis","Gaussian field;active learning;binary classification;clustering coefficient;empirical risk minimization;graph topological analysis;harmonic function;semisupervised learning","","0","","12","","","15-16 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many useful supervised learning methods have been introduced to the field of text classification. Among these useful methods, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a widely used method and one of the best text classifiers for its simplicity and efficiency. For text categorization, one document is often represented as a vector composed of a series of selected words called as feature items and this method is called the vector space model. KNN is one of the algorithms based on the vector space model. However, traditional KNN algorithm holds that the weight of each feature item in various categories is identical. Obviously, this is not reasonable. For each feature item may have different importance and distribution in different categories. Considering this disadvantage of traditional KNN algorithm, we put forward a refined weighted KNN algorithm based on the idea of variance. Experimental results show that the refined weighted KNN makes a significant improvement on the performance of traditional KNN classifier.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6793-8; POD:978-1-4244-6791-4","10.1109/ISKE.2010.5680854","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680854","KNN;text categorization;vector space model;weight calculation","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Machine learning;Support vector machine classification;Text categorization;Training;Weight measurement","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;text analysis;vectors","document classification;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;supervised learning method;text categorization;text mining;vector space model","","1","","9","","","15-16 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
