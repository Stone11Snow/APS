An intrusion detection method based on parallel SVM is proposed and a detection model system is constructed in this paper. First, original training dataset gained from network is divided into three subsets according to the network protocol (TCP, UDP and ICMP). Second, every subset is parted into multi-subsets and sent to parallel SVMs. Then we get multiple results from SVM trainers. The incremental learning algorithm of SVM is used to train new data sets instead of reconstructing SVM for whole data. This method improves the training efficiency by reducing the size of training subsets. At last, simulation experiments are done with KDD CUP 1999 data set. The experiment results show that the training time of SVM is shortened and the detection accuracy obtained by our method is exactly same as that obtained by others.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5228-6; POD:978-1-4244-5227-9","10.1109/JCPC.2009.5420129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5420129","","Data security;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Learning systems;Machine learning;Parallel algorithms;Pervasive computing;Protocols;Support vector machines;Ubiquitous computing","groupware;parallel algorithms;protocols;security of data;support vector machines;ubiquitous computing","cooperative intrusion detection system;high speed network;large scale network;learning algorithm;network protocol;parallel SVM;pervasive computing;support vector machine","","0","","7","","","3-5 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, we discuss a structured approach to Internet data representation and modeling that provides a framework for systematically applying tools from statistical analysis, signal processing or machine learning, and techniques from mathematical modeling. By respecting the multi-scale (in time, space, and layers) nature of the data, the proposed approach offers critical insights into a number of challenging network research problems.

Contention resolution approaches are always reactive and attempt to minimize the BLR based on local information available at the core node. On the other hand, a proactive approach that avoids burst losses before they occur is desirable. To reduce the probability of burst contention, a more robust routing algorithm than the shortest path is needed. This paper proposes a new routing mechanism for JET-based OBS networks, called graphical probabilistic routing model (GPRM) that selects less utilized links, on a hop-by-hop basis by using a Bayesian network. We assume no wavelength conversion and no buffering to be available at the core nodes of the OBS network. We simulate the proposed approach under dynamic load to demonstrate that it reduces the BLR burst loss ratio compared to static approaches by using Network Simulator 2 (ns-2) on NSFnet network topology and with realistic traffic matrix. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms static approaches in terms of BLR.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4244-4148-8; POD:978-1-4244-4147-1; POD:978-1-4244-4148-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425570","","Bayesian methods;Graphical models;Machine learning;Optical burst switching;Optical losses;Optical wavelength conversion;Routing;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","graph theory;optical burst switching;optical fibre networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","Bayesian network;NSFnet network topology;burst contention;burst loss ratio;contention resolution;graphical probabilistic routing model;network simulator 2;optical burst switching;wavelength conversion","","2","","10","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional techniques such as header and payload inspection are not providing sufficient information due to usage of non-standard ports and encryption. Promising alternative methods have been proposed based on the statistical behaviour of traffic flows. Although these methods can achieve quite high accuracies in non-encrypted traffic flows, traffic identification of encrypted traffic flows is still in its early stages. We argue that the results to date for encrypted traffic cannot help a network device such as a firewall make any useful decision, nor are there any indications that this may be achieved in the future. We propose a novel approach to cope with encrypted peer to peer network layer tunnels which are a particular problem in schools, universities, and larger corporate networks. First statistical techniques are used to identify the protocols present, a process that may take in the order of seconds. Next, based on the protocols discovered, and enterprise policies, a network device is advised to block, band-limit, or allow the whole tunnel, or a range of packet sizes within that tunnel. Preliminary research has concluded that VoIP traffic can be successfully handled by this approach and that advise to a network device can be practically useful. Work continues to apply these techniques to other protocols and mixes of protocols within a peer to peer tunnels.","1738-9445;17389445","Electronic:978-1-4244-5428-0; POD:978-1-4244-5427-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440217","Encrypted Traffic;IPSec;Traffic Classification;VPN;VoIP","Cryptography;Inspection;Internet telephony;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Videoconference;Virtual private networks","Internet telephony;cryptography;peer-to-peer computing;protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","VoIP traffic;encrypted peer to peer network layer tunnels;encrypted traffic flows;statistical techniques;traffic classification;tunneled traffic analysis","","1","","22","","","7-10 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The representation of the data plays an important role in determining what types of patterns can be automatically discovered. Many algorithms for machine learning assume that the data are represented as elements in a metric space. The performance of these algorithms can depend sensitively on the manner in which distances are measured. When data are represented as points in a multidimensional vector space, simple Euclidean distances are often used to measure the dissimilarity between different examples. However, such distances often do not yield reliable judgments; in addition, they cannot highlight the distinctive features that play a role in certain types of classification, but not others. Naturally, for different types of clustering, different ways of measuring dissimilarity were needed. In particular, different metrics for computing distances between feature vectors.

At the core of the proposed approach is a min-max stochastic optimization of a regularized cost function that combines machine learning with ΣΔ modulation. As a result, the algorithm not only produces a quantized sequence of the transformed analog signals but also a quantized representation of the transform itself. The framework is generic and can be extended to higher order ΣΔ modulators and for different signal transformations. In this paper, the ΣΔ learning is demonstrated for identifying linear compression manifolds, which can eliminate redundant AD conversion (ADC) paths. This improves the energy efficiency of the proposed architecture compared to a conventional multichannel data acquisition system. Measured results from a four channel prototype fabricated in a 0.5 μm CMOS process has been used to verify the energy efficiency of the ΣΔ learner and to demonstrate its real-time adaptation capabilities that are consistent with the theoretical and simulated results. One of the salient features of ΣΔ learning is its self-calibration property, whereby the performance remains unchanged even in the presence of computational artifacts (mismatch and nonlinearities). This property makes the proposed architecture ideal for implementing practical high-dimensional AD converters.","1549-8328;15498328","","10.1109/TCSI.2009.2025002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071176","<formula formulatype=""inline""> <tex Notation=""TeX"">$SigmaDelta$</tex></formula> conversion;Manifold learning;analog-to-digital conversion (ADC);high-dimensional signal processing;multichannel ADC;signal decorrelation","Cost function;Delta-sigma modulation;Design optimization;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Manifolds;Signal processing;Stochastic processes","CMOS integrated circuits;learning (artificial intelligence);minimax techniques;modulators;quantisation (signal);sigma-delta modulation;stochastic processes","ΣΔ learning algorithms;ΣΔ modulation;AD converters;CMOS process;high-dimensional analog signal space;linear compression manifolds;machine learning;min-max stochastic optimization framework;quantized sequence;regularized cost function;self-calibration property;size 0.5 μm","","5","","37","","20090610","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed architecture was proved in an animate environment using a multi-agent platform where several learning capabilities and emergent properties for self-configuring internal agent's architecture arise.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6080-9; POD:978-1-4244-6079-3","10.1109/ICCEA.2010.87","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5445796","Artificial Immune Systems;Cognitive Architectures;Evolutionary Approaches;Gene Expression Programming;Intelligent Agents","Environmental management;Gene expression;Genetic programming;Intelligent agent;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Multiagent systems;Parallel programming;Robustness","cognitive systems;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;software architecture","aggregation mechanism;evolutionary mechanism;evolvable cognitive architecture;gene expression programming;intelligent agents;multi-agent system;multilayered cognitive architectures;reinforcement machine learning systems;self-organized evolvable architecture;subsumption theory","","0","","15","","","19-21 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, numerous instances of Â¿possible mappingsÂ¿ between the schemas may be derived from the matching result. In this paper, we study the problem of managing possible mappings between two heterogeneous XML schemas. We observe that for XML schemas, their possible mappings have a high degree of overlap. We hence propose a novel data structure, called the block tree, to capture the commonalities among possible mappings. The block tree is useful for representing the possible mappings in a compact manner, and can be generated efficiently. Moreover, it supports the evaluation of probabilistic twig query (PTQ), which returns the probability of portions of an XML document that match the query pattern. For users who are interested only in answers with k-highest probabilities, we also propose the top-k PTQ, and present an efficient solution for it. The second challenge we have tackled is to efficiently generate possible mappings for a given schema matching. While this problem can be solved by existing algorithms, we show how to improve the performance of the solution by using a divide-and-conquer approach. An extensive evaluation on realistic datasets show that our approaches significantly improve the efficiency of generating, storing, and querying possible mappings.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4244-5446-4; POD:978-1-4244-5445-7; USB:978-1-4244-5444-0","10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447868","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447868","","Catalogs;Companies;Computer science;Databases;Machine learning;Pattern matching;Technology management;Tree data structures;Uncertainty;XML","XML;data integrity;learning (artificial intelligence);probability","COMA++;PTQ;XML schema matching;block tree;k-highest probabilities;machine learning technologies;probabilistic twig query;querying possible mappings","","2","","22","","","1-6 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article deals with the microRNA-target prediction and presents an innovative method for it. First it generates a set of promising binding sites for a given microRNA using a Genetic Algorithm, at the same time a set of target genes is selected based on the biological process under study. Secondly the set of promising binding sites is mapped into the selected set of target genes, in order to provide real binding sites and finally the resulting targets are filtered according to a biological or structural property. The objectives are to provide a flexible method that is capable of incorporating easily new knowledge, is independent of availability of the experimental information and is able to give hints on the research towards new characteristics among the microRNA binding sites such as motifs.

Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) are one of the state-of-the-art SRL models that combine first-order logic and Markov networks (MNs) by attaching weights to first-order formulas and viewing these as templates for features of MNs. Learning models in SRL consists in learning the structure (logical clauses in MLNs) and the parameters (weights for each clause in MLNs). Structure learning of MLNs is performed by maximizing a likelihood function over relational databases and MLNs have been successfully applied to problems in relational and uncertain domains. Theory revision is the process of refining an existing theory by generalizing or specializing it depending on the nature of the new evidence. If the positive evidence is not explained then the theory must be generalized, whereas if the negative evidence is explained the theory must be specialized in order to exclude the negative example. Current SRL systems do not revise an existing model but learn structure and parameters from scratch. In this paper we propose a novel refining algorithm for theory revision under the statistical logical framework of MLNs. The novelty of the proposed approach consists in a tight integration of structure and parameter learning of an SRL model in a single step inside which a specialization or generalization step is performed for theory refinement.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5918-6; POD:978-1-4244-5917-9","10.1109/CISIS.2010.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447415","Markov Logic Networks;Statistical Relational Learning;Theory revision","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Graphical models;Joining processes;Learning systems;Logic programming;Machine learning;Probabilistic logic;Relational databases;Uncertainty","Markov processes;formal logic;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);probability","Markov logic networks;first-order logic;likelihood function;logic-based learning approach;machine learning;probabilistic graphical model;relational databases;relational domain;statistical relational learning;statistical-logical models;structure refining algorithm;theory revision;uncertain domain","","0","","51","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Achieving reduction of the number of relevant traffic features without negative effect on classification accuracy is a goal that greatly improves the overall effectiveness of the IDS. Obtaining a good feature set automatically without involving expert knowledge is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature selection procedure based on the filter method used in machine learning. In particular, we focus on Correlation Feature Selection (CFS). By transforming the CFS optimization problem into a polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming problem and by introducing additional variables in the problem transformed in such a way, we obtain a new mixed 0 - 1 linear programming problem with a number of constraints and variables that is linear in the number of full set features. The mixed 0-1 linear programming problem can then be solved by means of branch-and-bound algorithm. Our feature selection algorithm was compared experimentally with the best-first-CFS and the genetic-algorithm-CFS methods regarding the feature selection capabilities. The classification accuracy obtained after the feature selection by means of the C4.5 and the BayesNet machines over the KDD CUP'99 IDS benchmarking data set was also tested. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the best first and genetic algorithm search strategies by removing much more redundant features and still keeping the classification accuracies or even getting better performances.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5880-6; POD:978-1-4244-5879-0","10.1109/ARES.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438117","correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 0-1 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming","Classification algorithms;Computer vision;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Integer linear programming;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Machine learning;Polynomials;Testing","Bayes methods;correlation theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical programming;security of data;tree searching","Bayesnet machines;IDS;best-first-CFS;branch-and-bound algorithm;classification accuracy;correlation feature selection;expert knowledge;feature selection algorithm;filter method;fractional programming problem;genetic algorithm;improving effectiveness;intrusion detection systems;linear programming problem;machine learning;optimization problem;redundant features;traffic features","","15","","16","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The flows are versioned across multiple documents and applications. This model is based on new fine-grained tracking and analysis capabilities derived from machine learning research. Using these capabilities, we outline a view of documents based on results from an experiment that tracked the activities of 17 information workers doing their regular work over 8 weeks. The research supports certain postmodern theories of work, specifically the notion of ""pasting up."" The construct of provenance describes information flows and networks and is the core theoretical base of the paper.

"Robust bidding in LCS using loan and bid history","A. Workineh; A.

All classifiers participating in an auction issue a bid proportional to their strength and a winner classifier is allowed to fire and receive a reward or punishment from its environment as a consequence of its action. However, in this kind of bidding strategy, optimal classifiers with low strength have to wait until the strength of bad classifiers has come down through continuous taxation. This slows down the convergence rate. In addition, as Genetic Algorithm(GA) has some degree of randomness, offspring classifiers that come from weak parents inherit a small strength as compared to experienced classifiers in the population and hence have to wait for some time till they mature and try their action. In this paper, we introduced bid history and loan concepts to mitigate the above shortcomings of the bidding strategy in traditional LCS. In direct analogy with real auctions, all classifiers matching the current input compare the average bid history with their potential bid based on their current strength. The average bid history parameter gives general information about the bid market (potential of competent classifiers) and determines the amount of loan a classifier should ask. We have also added a debt and due date parameters to the traditional LCS parameter list to keep track of the transaction status and accuracy and experience to grant or deny loan requests. The results obtained show a significant improvement on the performance of the system.","1095-323X;1095323X","Electronic:978-1-4244-3888-4; POD:978-1-4244-3887-7","10.1109/AERO.2010.5446803","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5446803","","Control systems;Convergence;Fires;Genetics;History;Impedance matching;Information technology;Machine learning;Robust control;Robustness","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);marketing;pattern classification;taxation","GA;LCS robust bidding;bid history;competent classifiers;competitive market economy;continuous taxation;convergence rate;genetic algorithm;learning classifier systems;loan history;offspring classifiers;reinforcement program","","1","","19","","","6-13 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our previous studies using a special type of swarms, known as flocks of agents, provided some promising approaches to this challenging problem on several limited size UCI machine learning data sets and Web usage sessions (from web access logs). However, dynamic domains, such as practically any data generated on the Web, may require frequent costly updates of the clusters (and the visualization), whenever new data records are added to the dataset. The new coming data may be due to new user activity on a website (clickstreams) or a search engine (queries), or new Web pages in the case of document clustering, etc. Additionally, data records may result in a change of clustering in time. Therefore, clusters may need to be updated, thus leading to the need to mine dynamic clusters. This paper summarizes our initial studies in designing a simultaneous clustering and visualization algorithm and proposes the Dynamic-FClust Algorithm, which is based on flocks of agents as a biological metaphor. This algorithm falls within the swarm-based clustering family, which is unique compared to other approaches, because its model is an ongoing swarm of agents that socially interact with each other, and is therefore inherently dynamic.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6523-1; POD:978-1-4244-6522-4; USB:978-1-4244-6521-7","10.1109/ICDEW.2010.5452721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452721","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data visualization;Image segmentation;Iterative algorithms;Machine learning;Particle swarm optimization;Search engines;Web mining;Web pages","data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;pattern clustering","UCI machine learning data set;Web usage session;biological metaphor;data record;data visualization;dynamic data clustering;dynamic-FClust algorithm;flocks-of-agents;high-dimensional sparse data;swarm intelligence;swarm-based clustering","","2","","12","","","1-6 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To develop the fuzzy system the membership functions and rule set are encoded as particles and evolved simultaneously using PSO. While designing the fuzzy classifier using PSO, the membership functions are represented as real numbers and the rule set is represented as discrete numbers. In the classification problem under consideration the objective is to maximize the correctly classified data and minimize the number of rules. This objective is formulated as fitness function to guide the search procedure to select an appropriate fuzzy classification system so that the number of fuzzy rules and the number of incorrectly classified patterns are simultaneously minimized.

Summarization of such information is becoming increasingly important. The aim of this paper is to study and compare the linguistic feature methods that are appropriate for use in terrorism event extraction systems. The event extraction has a main function to named entity recognition and segments the terrorism events from news articles to display to the users. The research methodology in the paper compares many linguistic features techniques including the terrorism gazetteer, the terrorism ontology and terrorism grammar rule. The annotated entities are summarized into the three desired template events.

Specifically, we examine the linear acceleration-sensing Nintendo Wii Remote coupled with the angular velocity-sensing Nintendo Wii MotionPlus. For the study, we created a 3D gesture database, collecting data on 25 distinct gestures totalling 8500 gestures samples. Our experiment explores how the number of gestures and the amount of gestures samples used to train two commonly used machine learning algorithms, a linear and AdaBoost classifier, affect overall recognition accuracy. We examined these gesture recognition algorithms with user dependent and user independent training approaches and explored the affect of using the Wii Remote with and without the Wii MotionPlus attachment. Our results show that in the user dependent case, both the Ad-aBoost and linear classification algorithms can recognize up to 25 gestures at over 90% accuracy, with 15 training samples per gesture, and up to 20 gestures at over 90% accuracy, with only five training samples per gesture. In particular, all 25 gestures could be recognized at over 99% accuracy with the linear classifier using 15 training samples per gesture, with the Wii Remote coupled with the Wii MotionPlus. In addition, both algorithms can recognize up to nine gestures at over 90% accuracy using a user independent training database with 100 samples per gesture.

Based on a improved feature selection algorithm, this paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model with computational efficiency and high detection accuracy. The algorithm is based on information gain and SVM. Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy).

As the amount of spam has been increased tremendously using bulk mailing tools, spam detection techniques should deal with it. For spam detection, parameters optimization and feature selection have been proposed to reduce processing overheads with guaranteeing high detection rates. However, the previous approaches have not taken into account variable importance and optimal number of features and there are no approaches using both of them together so far. In this paper, we propose an optimal spam detection model based on Random Forests (RF) which enables parameters optimization and feature selection. We optimize two parameters of RF to maximize the detection rates. We provide the variable importance of each feature so that it is easy to eliminate the irrelevant features. Furthermore, we decide an optimal number of selected features using two methods; (i) only one parameters optimization during overall feature selection, (ii) parameters optimization in every feature elimination phase.

"Out-of-core assessment of clustering tendency for large data sets","M. K.

Conventional clustering techniques assume a certain number of clusters, and then try to find out the possible cluster structure associated to the above number. For very large and complex data sets it is not easy to guess this number of clusters. There exists validity based clustering techniques, which measure a certain cluster validity measure of a certain clustering result by varying the number of clusters. After doing this for a broad range of possible number of clusters, this method selects the number for which the validity measure is optimum. This method is, however, awkward and may not always be applicable for very large data sets. Recently an interesting visual technique for determining clustering tendency has been developed.

There are three main types of recommender systems: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and demographic recommender systems. Collaborative filtering recommender systems recommend items by taking into account the taste (in terms of preferences of items) of users, under the assumption that users will be interested in items that users similar to them have rated highly. Content-based filtering recommender systems recommend items based on the textual information of an item, under the assumption that users will like similar items to the ones they liked before. Demographic recommender systems categorize users or items based on their personal attribute and make recommendation based on demographic categorizations. These systems suffer from scalability, data sparsity, and cold-start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations and reduced coverage. In this paper, we propose a unique cascading hybrid recommendation approach by combining the rating, feature, and demographic information about items. We empirically show that our approach outperforms the state of the art recommender system algorithms, and eliminates recorded problems with recommender systems.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5398-6; POD:978-1-4244-5397-9","10.1109/WKDD.2010.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432716","Recommender systems;collaborative filtering;content-based filtering;demographic recommender system","Collaboration;Computer science;Data mining;Demography;Information filtering;Information filters;Machine learning;Predictive models;Recommender systems;Scalability","content-based retrieval;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems","collaborative filtering recommender systems;content-based filtering recommender systems;demographic categorizations;demographic information;demographic recommender systems;hybrid recommender system;information filtering;machine learning techniques;recommender system algorithms;textual information","","15","","11","","","9-10 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Basically, each sensor should provide different selectivity profiles over the range of target odor application so that a unique odor pattern is produced from each sensor in the array. However, some or most of the features obtained from an array of sensors in practice are redundant and irrelevant due to cross-sensitivity and odor characteristics. The goal in this study is to optimize the number of sensors and also propose a fast searching strategy to the optimal solution. In this study, a state-of-the-art classification algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is employed by selecting the first few seed sensors based on maximum margin criterion among different odor classes. These identified sensors are subsequently used as an initial candidate in the search algorithm. From the experimental results on the soda data set, the number of selected sensors is not only significantly reduced but the classification performance is also increased.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5398-6; POD:978-1-4244-5397-9","10.1109/WKDD.2010.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432749","Electronic noses (e-noses);feature subset selection;genetic algorithm (GA);sensor subset selection;support vector machine;transient feature extraction","Array signal processing;Classification algorithms;Electronic noses;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Sensor arrays;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Signal processing algorithms;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","chemioception;computerised instrumentation;electronic noses;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;search problems;support vector machines","classification algorithm;electronic noses;fast searching strategy;genetic algorithm;machine olfaction;maximum margin criterion;multiclass support vector machine;odor characteristics;seed sensors;sensor subset selection;soda data set;transient feature extraction","","1","","16","","","9-10 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We address this disambiguation problem, which is very similar to the entity resolution problem studied in relational databases, however there are also several differences. Most importantly Web pages often only contain partial or incomplete information about the persons, moreover the available information is very heterogeneous, thus we are only able to obtain some uncertain evidence about whether two names refer to the same person using similarity functions. These similarity functions capture some aspects of the similarities between Web-pages, where the names occur, thus they perform very differently for the different names.

The first is a neural network based approach. where an algorithm of multi resolution technique based on Haar basis functions was used to obtain an image with different scales. Thereafter a classification was carried out with the multilayer feed forward neural network. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) technique was used as a dimension reduction technique to make the classification process much more efficient. The second approach is based on boosting which also yields very good detection rates. In general, boosting is one of the most important developments in classification methodology.

However, up to our knowledge, the use of fuzzy combination methods composed of a fuzzy system is less extended. By using a fuzzy linguistic rule-based classification system as a combination method, the resulting classifier ensemble would show a hierarchical structure and the operation of the latter component would be transparent to the user. Moreover, for the specific case of fuzzy multiclassification systems, the new approach could also become a smart way to allow fuzzy classifiers to deal with high dimensional problems avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The present contribution establishes the first basis in this direction by introducing a genetic fuzzy system-based framework to build the fuzzy linguistic combination method for a bagging fuzzy multiclassification system.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4622-3; POD:978-1-4244-4621-6","10.1109/GEFS.2010.5454152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5454152","","Bagging;Classification tree analysis;Computer science;Decision trees;Fuzzy reasoning;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy systems;Genetics;Machine learning;Neural networks","fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","bagging fuzzy multiclassification system;classifier ensemble;fuzzy aggregation operators;fuzzy linguistic combination methods;fuzzy linguistic rule-based system;genetic fuzzy-based system","","1","","34","","","17-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Assuming the intuitive hypothesis that an image could be represented by a linear combination of the training images from the same class, we propose a novel approach for visual object categorization in which a sparse representation of the image is first of all obtained by solving a L1 (or L0)-minimization problem and then fed into a traditional classifier such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) to finally perform the specified task.

Yu","DB&KE Lab., Sichuan Univ., Chengdu, China","2010 International Conference on Data Storage and Data Engineering","20100422","2010","","","95","100","Clustering of data streams has received much attention in recent years. Many algorithms have been proposed in order to discover clusters in data streams efficiently and effectively. Most of these algorithms are devoted to discover the clusters with high density, correlation and low intra-cluster distance. Especially, many methods are considered to balance the memory, the time consumption and the clustering effects. However, few related works focus on the important characteristic of evolving data stream that the distribution of the data items is dense and partially concentrative on the timeline, and one data item usually just has influence to other items in limited range of time. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called MawStream (clustering with Multiple Adaptive sliding Window). In MawStream each data item in potential cluster associates with an adaptive time window. Instead of fixed length of window, the window length of a data item is computed according to its influence. Once one data item's window length becomes zero, it's called unactive and needs not further processing. Such mechanism avoids dealing with too many data in clustering data streams. MawStream can handle detailed correlations among finite points in a time bucket and find high quality clusters in period of time. At the same time, MawStream allows users to submit offline queries to determine whether some potential clusters are similar to the specified cluster in order to cope with in-definability of the number of potential clusters. The result of experiment using both actual and synthetic datasets shows that our algorithm could cluster data streams efficiently with high quality.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5679-6; POD:978-1-4244-5678-9","10.1109/DSDE.2010.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452630","Clustering;Data Stream;Sliding Time Window","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Couplings;Data engineering;Educational institutions;Machine learning;Memory;Scattering;Springs;Unsupervised learning","data handling;data mining;pattern clustering","MawStream;data stream clustering;multiple adaptive sliding window","","0","","14","","","9-10 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We test our optimizer design both in a simulation environment as well as on a network testbed with low-power radios. Our results show that even basic simulated annealing works well, but simple graphical models can further increase the convergence rate.
