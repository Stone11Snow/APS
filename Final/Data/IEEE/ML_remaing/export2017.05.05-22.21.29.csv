The strength of our approach is that it does not require prior musical source separation. Thanks to a hierarchical clustering algorithm exploiting robust probabilistic distances, we obtain a taxonomy of musical ensembles which is used to efficiently classify possible combinations of instruments played simultaneously. Moreover, a wide set of acoustic features is studied including some new proposals. In particular, signal to mask ratios are found to be useful features for audio classification. This study focuses on a single music genre (i.e., jazz) but combines a variety of instruments among which are percussion and singing voice. Using a varied database of sound excerpts from commercial recordings, we show that the segmentation of music with respect to the instruments played can be achieved with an average accuracy of 53%.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TSA.2005.860351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561265","Hierarchical taxonomy;instrument recognition;machine learning;pairwise classification;pairwise feature selection;polyphonic music;probabilistic distances;support vector machines","Audio recording;Clustering algorithms;Frequency;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Music;Proposals;Source separation;Streaming media;Taxonomy","acoustic signal processing;audio signal processing;music;pattern classification;source separation","audio classification;automatic taxonomies;hierarchical clustering algorithm;instrument recognition;music orchestrations;music segmentation;percussion;polyphonic music;singing voice","","43","","60","","","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we show theoretically that the recently developed extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm can be used to train the neural networks with threshold functions directly instead of approximating them with sigmoid functions. Experimental results based on real-world benchmark regression problems demonstrate that the generalization performance obtained by ELM is better than other algorithms used in threshold networks. Also, the ELM method does not need control variables (manually tuned parameters) and is much faster.","1549-7747;15497747","","10.1109/TCSII.2005.857540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605431","Extreme learning machine (ELM);gradient descent method;threshold neural networks","Analog computers;Computational efficiency;Computer networks;Learning systems;Machine learning;Neural network hardware;Neural networks;Neurons;Process control;System-on-a-chip","gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;regression analysis;threshold elements","ELM algorithm;extreme learning machine;gradient descent method;neural networks;real-world benchmark regression problems;threshold networks","","117","","13","","","March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a probabilistic model for mining labeled ordered trees, and we further present an efficient learning algorithm for this model, based on an EM algorithm. The time and space complexities of this algorithm are rather favorable, falling within the practical limits set by a variety of existing probabilistic models, including stochastic context-free grammars. Experimental results have shown that, in a supervised problem setting, the proposed method outperformed five other competing methods by a statistically significant factor in all cases.

"Nearest neighbors by neighborhood counting","Hui Wang","Fac. of Eng., Ulster Univ., Jordanstown, UK","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","20060424","2006","28","6","942","953","Finding nearest neighbors is a general idea that underlies many artificial intelligence tasks, including machine learning, data mining, natural language understanding, and information retrieval. This idea is explicitly used in the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (kNN), a popular classification method. In this paper, this idea is adopted in the development of a general methodology, neighborhood counting, for devising similarity functions. We turn our focus from neighbors to neighborhoods, a region in the data space covering the data point in question. To measure the similarity between two data points, we consider all neighborhoods that cover both data points. We propose to use the number of such neighborhoods as a measure of similarity. Neighborhood can be defined for different types of data in different ways. Here, we consider one definition of neighborhood for multivariate data and derive a formula for such similarity, called neighborhood counting measure or NCM. NCM was tested experimentally in the framework of kNN. Experiments show that NCM is generally comparable to VDM and its variants, the state-of-the-art distance functions for multivariate data, and, at the same time, is consistently better for relatively large k values. Additionally, NCM consistently outperforms HEOM (a mixture of Euclidean and Hamming distances), the ""standard"" and most widely used distance function for multivariate data. NCM has a computational complexity in the same order as the standard Euclidean distance function and NCM is task independent and works for numerical and categorical data in a conceptually uniform way. The neighborhood counting methodology is proven sound for multivariate data experimentally. We hope it works for other types of data.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624358","Pattern recognition;distance;machine learning;nearest neighbors;neighborhood counting measure.;similarity","Artificial intelligence;Computational complexity;Data mining;Euclidean distance;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Natural languages;Nearest neighbor searches;Testing","artificial intelligence;pattern classification","Euclidean distances;Hamming distances;artificial intelligence tasks;classification method;computational complexity;data mining;information retrieval;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;machine learning;multivariate data;natural language understanding;neighborhood counting measure;similarity functions;similarity measure;state-of-the-art distance functions","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","56","","29","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This approach is limited by the difficulties in working effectively in the transfer function space beyond two dimensions. We present a new approach to the volume classification problem which couples machine learning and a painting metaphor to allow more sophisticated classification in an intuitive manner. The user works in the volume data space by directly painting on sample slices of the volume and the painted voxels are used in an iterative training process. The trained system can then classify the entire volume. Both classification and rendering can be hardware accelerated, providing immediate visual feedback as painting progresses. Such an intelligent system approach enables the user to perform classification in a much higher dimensional space without explicitly specifying the mapping for every dimension used. Furthermore, the trained system for one data set may be reused to classify other data sets with similar characteristics.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407860","Index Terms- User interface design;classification;graphics hardware;machine learning.;transfer functions;visualization;volume rendering","Acceleration;Data visualization;Feedback;Graphics;Hardware;Intelligent systems;Machine learning;Painting;Rendering (computer graphics);Transfer functions","computer graphic equipment;data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;image classification;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);opacity;rendering (computer graphics)","data classification;graphics hardware;intelligent system;interactive editing;iterative training;machine learning;opacity;painting metaphor;user interface design;visual feedback;volume classification problem;volume data visualization;volume rendering;volume sample slices;voxel visibility","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","65","1","28","","","May-June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We present an algorithm that uses multiple cues to recover shading and reflectance intrinsic images from a single image. Using both color information and a classifier trained to recognize gray-scale patterns, given the lighting direction, each image derivative is classified as being caused by shading or a change in the surface's reflectance. The classifiers gather local evidence about the surface's form and color, which is then propagated using the generalized belief propagation algorithm. The propagation step disambiguates areas of the image where the correct classification is not clear from local evidence.

Second, we partition the contents of different object data appearing in the object region and construct object data using hierarchical XML outputs. Third, we induce the abstract object model from the analogous object data. This model would match the corresponding object data from a Web site more precisely and comprehensively than the existing handcrafted ontologies. The main contribution of this study is in developing a fully automated approach to extract object data and object model from semistructured Web documents using kernel-based matching and view syntax interpretation.

In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy support vector machine to discriminate good creditors from bad ones. Because in credit scoring areas we usually cannot label one customer as absolutely good who is sure to repay in time, or absolutely bad who will default certainly, our new fuzzy support vector machine treats every sample as both positive and negative classes, but with different memberships.

We reformulate this kind of two-group classification problem into a quadratic programming problem.

Its multilayer structure can handle complex problems. Based on the entropy estimation, information theory-based learning is performed locally at each neuron.

We use experiments with synthetic data to illustrate this bias. We then demonstrate that this bias can be exploitable using a data set of protein sequences containing several classes of subcellular localization targeting peptides. The results show that, compared with feed forward, recurrent neural networks will generally perform better on sequence analysis tasks.

Ogihara","","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","20060515","2006","8","3","564","574","Efficient and intelligent music information retrieval is a very important topic of the 21st century. With the ultimate goal of building personal music information retrieval systems, this paper studies the problem of intelligent music information retrieval. Huron points out that since the preeminent functions of music are social and psychological, the most useful characterization would be based on four types of information: genre, emotion, style,and similarity. This paper introduces Daubechies Wavelet Coefficient Histograms (DWCH)for music feature extraction for music information retrieval. The histograms are computed from the coefficients of the db<sub>8</sub> Daubechies wavelet filter applied to 3 s of music. A comparative study of sound features and classification algorithms on a dataset compiled by Tzanetakis shows that combining DWCH with timbral features (MFCC and FFT), with the use of multiclass extensions of support vector machine,achieves approximately 80% of accuracy, which is a significant improvement over the previously known result on this dataset. On another dataset the combination achieves 75% of accuracy. The paper also studies the issue of detecting emotion in music. Rating of two subjects in the three bipolar adjective pairs are used. The accuracy of around 70% was achieved in predicting emotional labeling in these adjective pairs. The paper also studies the problem of identifying groups of artists based on their lyrics and sound using a semi-supervised classification algorithm. Identification of artist groups based on the Similar Artist lists at All Music Guide is attempted. The semi-supervised learning algorithm resulted in nontrivial increases in the accuracy to more than 70%. Finally, the paper conducts a proof-of-concept experiment on similarity search using the feature set.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2006.870730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632041","Clustering;FFT;machine learning;music information retrieval;wavelet","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Filters;Histograms;Intelligent structures;Labeling;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Music information retrieval;Psychology;Wavelet coefficients","emotion recognition;feature extraction;information retrieval;information retrieval systems;learning (artificial intelligence);music;support vector machines;wavelet transforms","Daubechies wavelet coefficient histogram;Daubechies wavelet filter;emotion detection;intelligent music information retrieval;music feature extraction;personal music information retrieval system;semisupervised classification algorithm;support vector machine","","55","","38","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Currently, the only definitive method to ascertain the presence of prostatic cancer is by trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) directed biopsy. Owing to the poor image quality of ultrasound, the accuracy of TRUS is only 20%-25%. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to have a higher accuracy of prostate cancer detection compared to ultrasound. Consequently, several researchers have been exploring the use of high resolution MRI in performing prostate biopsies. Visual detection of prostate cancer, however, continues to be difficult owing to its apparent lack of shape, and the fact that several malignant and benign structures have overlapping intensity and texture characteristics. In this paper, we present a fully automated computer-aided detection (CAD) system for detecting prostatic adenocarcinoma from 4 Tesla ex vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imagery of the prostate. After the acquired MR images have been corrected for background inhomogeneity and nonstandardness, novel three-dimensional (3-D) texture features are extracted from the 3-D MRI scene. A Bayesian classifier then assigns each image voxel a ""likelihood"" of malignancy for each feature independently. The ""likelihood"" images generated in this fashion are then combined using an optimally weighted feature combination scheme. Quantitative evaluation was performed by comparing the CAD results with the manually ascertained ground truth for the tumor on the MRI. The tumor labels on the MR slices were determined manually by an expert by visually registering the MR slices with the corresponding regions on the histology slices. We evaluated our CAD system on a total of 33 two-dimensional (2-D) MR slices from five different 3-D MR prostate studies. Five slices from two different glands were used for training. Our feature combination scheme was found to outperform the individual te- - xture features, and also other popularly used feature combination methods, including AdaBoost, ensemble averaging, and majority voting. Further, in several instances our CAD system performed better than the experts in terms of accuracy, the expert segmentations being determined solely from visual inspection of the MRI data. In addition, the intrasystem variability (changes in CAD accuracy with changes in values of system parameters) was significantly lower than the corresponding intraobserver and interobserver variability. CAD performance was found to be very similar for different training sets. Future work will focus on extending the methodology to guide high-resolution MRI-assisted in vivo prostate biopsies.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2005.859208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1546122","3-D texture;4 tesla;AdaBoost;CAD;MRI;general ensemble method;image analysis;image processing;machine learning;prostate;segmentation","Biopsy;Cancer detection;Image quality;Magnetic resonance;Magnetic resonance imaging;Neoplasms;Prostate cancer;Shape;Skin cancer;Ultrasonic imaging","Bayes methods;biomedical MRI;cancer;image classification;image resolution;image segmentation;image texture;medical image processing;tumours","AdaBoost,;Bayesian classifier;automated prostatic adenocarcinoma detection;benign structures;computer-aided detection;ensemble averaging;high-resolution ex vivo MRI;high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging;image registration;image segmentation;intrasystem variability;malignant structures;prostate cancer detection;texture features;transrectal ultrasound directed biopsy;tumor","Adenocarcinoma;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Prostatic Neoplasms;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","90","1","52","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Peptide sequences can be identified by correlating their observed tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) with theoretical spectra of peptides from a sequence database. Unfortunately, to perform this search the charge of the peptide must be known, and current charge-state-determination algorithms only discriminate singly-from multiply-charged spectra: distinguishing +2 from +3, for example, is unreliable. Thus, search software is forced to search multiply-charged spectra multiple times. To minimize this inefficiency, we present a support vector machine (SVM) that quickly and reliably classifies multiply-charged spectra as having either a +2 or +3 precursor peptide ion. By classifying multiply-charged spectra, we obtain a 40% reduction in search time while maintaining an average of 99% of peptide and 99% of protein identifications originally obtained from these spectra.","","POD:0-7695-2344-7","10.1109/CSB.2005.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498019","charge state;machine learning;mass spectrometry;proteomics;support vector machine","Bioinformatics;Databases;Genomics;Mass spectroscopy;Peptides;Proteins;Search methods;Sequences;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","biological techniques;biology computing;genetics;mass spectroscopy;molecular biophysics;pattern classification;proteins;search problems;support vector machines","SVM;charge-state-determination algorithms;machine learning;mass spectrometry;multiply-charged spectra classification;multiply-charged spectra search;peptide charge state determination;peptide sequences;peptides identification;protein identification;proteomics;search software;sequence database;singly-charged spectra;support vector machine;tandem mass spectra;theoretical peptide spectra","","3","","16","","","8-11 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The GDES method has a much better performance than the JDES method. The correctness of the GDES method is proved assuming that 1) the channel matrix is irreducible and column reduced and 2) the source spectral matrix has distinct diagonal functions. However, the GDES method has an inherent ability to trade off between the required condition on the channel matrix and that on the source spectral matrix.

This paper presents a machine-learning approach to deal with this question. In an off-line learning phase, a classifier is trained to quickly predict the feasibility of a query.

It has been empirically demonstrated that cascading other classification methods, which learn intermediate concepts, with decision tree learners can alleviate such representational bias of decision trees and potentially improve classification performance. However, a more complex model that fits training data better may not necessarily perform better on unseen data, commonly referred to as the overfitting problem. To find the most appropriate degree of such cascade generalization, a decision forest (i.e., a set of decision trees with other classification models cascaded to different degrees) needs to be generated, from which the best decision tree can then be identified. In this paper, the authors propose an efficient algorithm for generating such decision forests. The algorithm uses an extended decision tree data structure and constructs any node that is common to multiple decision trees only once. The authors have empirically evaluated the algorithm using 32 data sets for classification problems from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository and report on results demonstrating the efficiency of the algorithm in this paper.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2005.843392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495617","Cascade generalization;classification;data mining;decision forest;decision tree;machine learning","Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Decision making;Decision trees;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Predictive models;Supervised learning;Training data;Tree data structures","data mining;data structures;decision trees","cascade generalization;data mining;data structure;generalized decision forest;univariate decision tree learners","","9","","26","","","Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In all cases, there needs to be an underlying data mining system, and this mining system must be highly scalable. To this end, we describe a new rule learner called DataSqueezer. The learner belongs to the family of inductive supervised rule extraction algorithms. DataSqueezer is a simple, greedy, rule builder that generates a set of production rules from labeled input data. In spite of its relative simplicity, DataSqueezer is a very effective learner. The rules generated by the algorithm are compact, comprehensible, and have accuracy comparable to rules generated by other state-of-the-art rule extraction algorithms. The main advantages of DataSqueezer are very high efficiency, and missing data resistance. DataSqueezer exhibits log-linear asymptotic complexity with the number of training examples, and it is faster than other state-of-the-art rule learners. The learner is also robust to large quantities of missing data, as verified by extensive experimental comparison with the other learners. DataSqueezer is thus well suited to modern data mining and business intelligence tasks, which commonly involve huge datasets with a large fraction of missing data.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.852983","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580617","Complexity;DataSqueezer;data mining;machine learning;missing data;rule induction;rule learner","Bioinformatics;Companies;Computer science;Data mining;Decision support systems;Decision trees;Drugs;Production;Real time systems;Robustness","competitive intelligence;computational complexity;data mining;decision support systems;greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);very large databases","DataSqueezer rule learner;bioinformatics;business intelligence;data mining system;dataset mining;greedy rule builder;inductive supervised rule extraction algorithm;log-linear asymptotic complexity;machine learning;real-time enterprise-level decision support system","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Decision Support Techniques;Information Storage and Retrieval","22","","82","","","Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A recent increase in the number of protein-protein interactions has made predicting unknown protein-protein interactions important for the understanding of living cells. However, the protein-protein interactions experimentally obtained so far are often incomplete and contradictory and, consequently, existing computational prediction methods have integrated evidence (latent knowledge of proteins) from different and more reliable sources. Analyzing the relationships between proteins and the latent knowledge is important to understanding the cellular processes. For this analysis, we propose a new probabilistic model for protein-protein interactions by considering the latent knowledge of proteins. We further present an efficient learning algorithm for this model, based on an EM algorithm. Experimental results have shown that in a supervised test setting, the proposed method outperformed five other competing methods by a statistically significant factor in all cases. Using the probability parameters of a trained model, we have further shown the latent knowledge that is essential to predicting protein-protein interactions.

The decision rules obtained from the decision tree are then converted to the fuzzy IF-then rules, and the back-propagation algorithm is utilized to tune the parameters of the membership functions employed in the fuzzy classifier.

Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, relevance vector machine (RVM) regression, and support vector machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6° are obtained for a variety of walking motions.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542030","Index Terms- Computer vision;human motion estimation;machine learning;multivariate regression.","Biological system modeling;Humans;Image segmentation;Image sequences;Kernel;Labeling;Learning systems;Robustness;Shape;Support vector machines","computer vision;image motion analysis;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;support vector machines","3D human pose;histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors;human motion estimation;image silhouettes;learning-based method;monocular image sequences;nonlinear regression;relevance vector machine regression;ridge regression;shape descriptor vectors;silhouette shape;support vector machine regression","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Joints;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Posture;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","299","7","32","","","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Both oversampling and undersampling are considered. These techniques modify the distribution of the training data such that the costs of the examples are conveyed explicitly by the appearances of the examples. Threshold-moving tries to move the output threshold toward inexpensive classes such that examples with higher costs become harder to be misclassified. Moreover, hard-ensemble and soft-ensemble, i.e., the combination of above techniques via hard or soft voting schemes, are also tested. Twenty-one UCl data sets with three types of cost matrices and a real-world cost-sensitive data set are used in the empirical study. The results suggest that cost-sensitive learning with multiclass tasks is more difficult than with two-class tasks, and a higher degree of class imbalance may increase the difficulty. It also reveals that almost all the techniques are effective on two-class tasks, while most are ineffective and even may cause negative effect on multiclass tasks. Overall, threshold-moving and soft-ensemble are relatively good choices in training cost-sensitive neural networks. The empirical study also suggests that some methods that have been believed to be effective in addressing the class imbalance problem may, in fact, only be effective on learning with imbalanced two-class data sets.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1549828","Index Terms- Machine learning;class imbalance learning;cost-sensitive learning;data mining;ensemble learning.;neural networks;sampling;threshold-moving","Costs;Data mining;Decision trees;Learning systems;Machine learning;Neural networks;Sampling methods;Testing;Training data;Voting","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;sampling methods","class imbalance learning;cost-sensitive learning;cost-sensitive neural network training;data mining;ensemble learning;machine learning;oversampling technique;threshold-moving;undersampling technique","","286","","39","","","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Generally speaking, NNTrees can outperform standard DTs because the ENNs can extract more complex features. However, induction of multivariate DTs is very difficult. Even if each nonterminal node contains a simple oblique hyperplane, the induction problem can be NP-complete. To solve this problem, we have introduced an evolutionary algorithm that follows the same recursive procedure for inducing a standard DT, and designs an ENN for each nonterminal node using GA (genetic algorithm). This algorithm, however, is very time consuming and cannot be used easily. In this paper, we propose two new methods. One is to evolve the whole tree instead of evolving the ENNs recursively. Another is to define the group labels for the examples assigned to each nonterminal node using a heuristic method, and design the ENNs with the back propagation (BP) algorithm. Experimental results with 10 public databases show that the BP based algorithm is much more efficient than GA based algorithms.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:0-7803-9298-1","10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571248","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1571248","Machine learning;decision trees;neural network trees;neural networks;pattern recognition","Algorithm design and analysis;Decision trees;Electronic mail;Evolutionary computation;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Testing","backpropagation;genetic algorithms;heuristic programming;inference mechanisms;neural nets;trees (mathematics)","NP-completeness;back propagation algorithm;complex feature extraction;evolutionary algorithm;expert neural network;genetic algorithm;heuristic method;multivariate decision tree;neural network tree induction;nonterminal node;oblique hyperplane;recursive procedure","","6","","17","","","10-12 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose methods and procedures, based on Domingo's unified bias-variance theory, to evaluate and quantitatively measure the bias-variance decomposition of error in ensembles of learning machines. We apply these methods to study and compare the bias-variance characteristics of single support vector machines (SVMs) and ensembles of SVMs based on resampling techniques, and their relationships with the cardinality of the training samples. In particular, we present an experimental bias-variance analysis of bagged and random aggregated ensembles of SVMs in order to verify their theoretical variance reduction properties. The experimental bias-variance analysis quantitatively characterizes the relationships between bagging and random aggregating, and explains the reasons why ensembles built on small subsamples of the data work with large databases. Our analysis also suggests new directions for research to improve on classical bagging.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.850183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542270","Bagging;bias-variance analysis;ensemble of learning machines;support vector machines","Analysis of variance;Bagging;Data analysis;Databases;Decision trees;Kernel;Machine learning;Statistical analysis;Stochastic processes;Support vector machines","covariance analysis;sampling methods;support vector machines","SVM ensembles;bias-variance analysis;large databases;learning algorithm;random aggregating;resampling techniques;support vector machines","Algorithms;Analysis of Variance;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","32","","46","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since the node set of a cell-graph can include a cluster of cells as well as individual ones, it enables working with low-cost, low-magnification photomicrographs. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, it is shown that without establishing a pairwise spatial relation between the cells (i.e., the edges of a cell-graph), neither the spatial distribution of the cells nor the texture analysis of the images yields accurate results for tissue level diagnosis of brain cancer called malignant glioma. Second, this work defines a set of global metrics by processing the entire cell-graph to capture tissue level information coded into the histopathological images. In this work, the results are obtained on the photomicrographs of 646 archival brain biopsy samples of 60 different patients. It is shown that the global metrics of cell-graphs distinguish cancerous tissues from noncancerous ones with high accuracy (at least 99 percent accuracy for healthy tissues with lower cellular density level, and at least 92 percent accuracy for benign tissues with similar high cellular density level such as nonneoplastic reactive/inflammatory conditions).","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2005.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1504690","Index Terms- Image representation;graph theory;machine learning;medical information systems.;model development","Biopsy;Cancer;Fractals;Graph theory;Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Logistics;Machine learning;Neoplasms;Pixel","brain;cancer;cellular biophysics;graphs;image representation;medical image processing;tumours","automated cancer diagnosis;benign tissues;brain cancer;brain tumor topology;cancerous tissues;cell clusters;cell graph;cellular density;global metrics;graph-based representation;histopathological images;malignant glioma;nonneoplastic reactive/inflammatory conditions;photomicrographs;tissue level diagnosis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain Neoplasms;Cluster Analysis;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","26","1","27","","","July-Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A sense-function with a sense-range and fuzzy edges is defined as a transfer function for connections from the input layer to the hidden layer in the network. By generating hidden cells and adjusting the parameters of the sense-functions, the network self-organizes and adapts to a training set. Computing cells in the input layer are designed as data converters so that the network can deal with both symbolic data and numeric data. Hidden computing cells in the network can be explained via fuzzy rules in a similar manner to those in fuzzy neural networks. The values in the output layer can be explained as a belief distribution over a decision space. The final decision is made by means of the winner-take-all rule. The approach was applied to a series of the benchmark data sets with a diversity of data types and comparative results obtained.

To illustrate our approach, and to demonstrate its advantages, we construct a synthetic porous medium consisting of two heterogeneous materials and then estimate boundaries between these materials from a few selected data points.

In addition, some effective strategies such as kernel caching and efficient computation of kernel matrix are integrated to speed up the training process. Our analysis of the proposed algorithm shows that its time complexity grows linearly with the number of classes and size of the data set.

We present an event based control optimization formulation of the resource management problem and discuss a method to adaptively change desired system performance of the sensor network in response to events. This functionality is critical in field-deployable sensor networks where the available energy is extremely limited. This limitation disallows continuous operation as a very expensive option and necessitates system adaptation as a means to extend operational lifetime in the face of dynamic external events. We show results on synthetic sensor networks where only partially accurate information about the external world and the sensing system is available and illustrate the efficacy of the control algorithm in handling dynamic events with guaranteed minimum system lifespan via efficient usage of energy resources.

To combat this, we have previously developed a market-based recommender system that allows multiple agents (each representing a different recommendation method or system) to compete with one another to present their best recommendations to the user. In our system, the marketplace encourages good recommendations by rewarding the corresponding agents who supplied them according to the users' ratings of their suggestions. Moreover, we have theoretically shown how our system incites the agents to bid in a manner that ensures only the best recommendations are presented. To do this effectively in practice, however, each agent needs to be able to classify its recommendations into different internal quality levels, learn the users' interests for these different levels, and then adapt its bidding behavior for the various levels accordingly. To this end, in this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning and Boltzmann exploration strategy that the recommending agents can exploit for these tasks. We then demonstrate that this strategy does indeed help the agents to effectively obtain information about the users' interests which, in turn, speeds up the market convergence and enables the system to rapidly highlight the best recommendations.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1524967","Index Terms- Information filtering;machine learning;markets.;recommender systems","Collaboration;Convergence;Information filtering;Information filters;Machine learning;Recommender systems","information filters;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;pattern classification;user modelling","Boltzmann exploration strategy;bidding behavior;internal quality levels;market-based recommender systems;quality classification;reinforcement learning;user interest learning;user ratings","","12","2","25","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The knowledge of gene functions is crucial for understanding many fundamental biological mechanisms such as regulatory pathways, cell cycles and diseases. Our major goal is to accurately infer functions of putative genes or ORFs (Open Reading Frames) from existing databases using computational methods. However, this task is intrinsically difficult since the underlying biological processes represent complex interactions of multiple entities. Therefore many functional links would be missing when only one or two source of data is used in the prediction. Our hypothesis is that integrating evidence from multiple and complementary sources could significantly improve the prediction accuracy. In this paper, our experimental results not only suggest that the above hypothesis is valid, but also provide guidelines for using the WNB system for data collection, training and predictions. The combined training data sets contain information from gene annotations, gene expressions, clustering outputs, keyword annotations and sequence homology from public databases. The current system is trained and tested on the genes of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our WNB model can also be used to analyze the contribution of each source of information toward the prediction performance through the weight training process.

Its structure consists of two stages, a mapping stage and a learning stage. The input training vectors are initially mapped to the enhancement vectors in the mapping stage by multiplying with a random matrix, followed by pointwise nonlinear transformations. Starting with only one enhancement node, the enhancement layer incrementally adds an extra node in each iteration. The optimum dimension of the enhancement layer is determined by using an efficient leave-one-out cross-validation method. In this way, the number of enhancement nodes is also learned automatically. A t-test algorithm can also be applied to the mapping stage to mitigate the effect of overfitting and to further reduce the number of enhancement nodes required, resulting in a more compact network. In the learning stage, both the input vectors and the enhancement vectors are fed into a least squares learning module to obtain the estimated output vectors. This is made possible by choosing the output layer linear. In addition, several SSOLSs can be trained independently in parallel to form a consensual SSOLS, whose final output is a linear combination of the outputs of each SSOLS module. The SSOLS is simple, fast to compute, and suitable for remote sensing applications, especially with hyperspectral image data of high dimensionality.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.851188","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1487646","Artificial neural networks;hyperspectral image classification;machine learning;overfitting;support vector machine (SMV);t-test","Automatic testing;Buildings;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Learning systems;Least squares methods;Neural networks;Remote sensing;System testing;Vectors","geophysical techniques;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing;self-adjusting systems;support vector machines","enhancement node;enhancement vectors;hyperspectral image data;image classification;leave-one-out cross-validation method;machine learning;neural networks;overfitting;remote sensing;statistical hypothesis testing;statistical self-organizing learning system;support vector machine;t-test algorithm","","9","","24","","","Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Researchers have become aware how easy it is to incur a selection bias effect, and complex validation setups are required to avoid overly optimistic estimates of the predictive accuracy of the models and incorrect gene selections. This paper describes a semisupervised pattern discovery approach that uses the by-products of complete validation studies on experimental setups for gene profiling. In particular, we introduce the study of the patterns of single sample responses (sample-tracking profiles) to the gene selection process induced by typical supervised learning tasks in microarray studies. We originate sample-tracking profiles as the aggregated off-training evaluation of SVM models of increasing gene panel sizes. Genes are ranked by E-RFE, an entropy-based variant of the recursive feature elimination for support vector machines (RFE-SVM). A dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is then applied to define a metric between sample-tracking profiles. An unsupervised clustering based on the DTW metric allows automating the discovery of outliers and of subtypes of different molecular profiles. Applications are described on synthetic data and in two gene expression studies.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2005.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1438348","Machine learning;bioinformatics databases.;biology and genetics;classifier design and evaluation;clustering;data mining;feature evaluation and selection;pattern analysis;similarity measures","Accuracy;Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Costs;Gene expression;Predictive models;Semisupervised learning;Supervised learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","biology computing;entropy;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;support vector machines","class prediction;dynamic time warping;entropy;feature selection;gene expression;gene profiling;gene selections;learning tasks;microarray data;molecular profiling;recursive feature elimination;sample-tracking profiles;semisupervised learning;semisupervised pattern discovery approach;support vector machines;unsupervised clustering","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Pattern Recognition, Automated","12","","26","","","April-June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

If there is a smooth function that maps the DOF to the pixel values, then the images are confined to a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the image space. We propose a method based on probabilistic mixtures of factor analyzers to 1) model the density of images sampled from such manifolds and 2) recover global parameterizations of the manifold. A globally nonlinear probabilistic two-way mapping between coordinates on the manifold and images is obtained by combining several, locally valid, linear mappings.

Extending notions developed for statistical expert systems we present a prototype intelligent discovery assistant (IDA), which provides users with 1) systematic enumerations of valid DM processes, in order that important, potentially fruitful options are not overlooked, and 2) effective rankings of these valid processes by different criteria, to facilitate the choice of DM processes to execute. We use the prototype to show that an IDA can indeed provide useful enumerations and effective rankings in the context of simple classification processes.

Active learning aims at reducing the number of training examples to be labeled by automatically processing the unlabeled examples, and then selecting the most informative ones with respect to a given cost function for a human to label. In this paper we describe how to estimate the confidence score for each utterance through an on-line algorithm using the lattice output of a speech recognizer. The utterance scores are filtered through the informativeness function and an optimal subset of training samples is selected. The active learning algorithm has been applied to both batch and on-line learning scheme and we have experimented with different selective sampling algorithms.

A probabilistic variational analysis of this model reveals a set of fixed-point equations characterizing the equilibrium of the field. It leads to computationally efficient methods for calculating the image likelihood and for training the model. Based on that, effective algorithms for detecting nonrigid objects are developed. This new approach has several advantages. First, it is intrinsically suitable for capturing local nonrigidity. In addition, due to the distributed likelihood, this approach is robust to partial occlusions. Moreover, the two-layer structure provides large flexibility of modeling the image observations, which makes the new method robust to clutters.

In this paper, a new co-training style semi-supervised learning algorithm, named tri-training, is proposed. This algorithm generates three classifiers from the original labeled example set. These classifiers are then refined using unlabeled examples in the tri-training process. In detail, in each round of tri-training, an unlabeled example is labeled for a classifier if the other two classifiers agree on the labeling, under certain conditions. Since tri-training neither requires the instance space to be described with sufficient and redundant views nor does it put any constraints on the supervised learning algorithm, its applicability is broader than that of previous co-training style algorithms.

In order to generate a strong ensemble, the component learners should be with high accuracy as well as high diversity. A popularly used scheme in generating accurate but diverse component learners is to perturb the training data with resampling methods, such as the bootstrap sampling used in bagging. However, such a scheme is not very effective on local learners such as nearest-neighbor classifiers because a slight change in training data can hardly result in local learners with big differences. In this paper, a new ensemble algorithm named Filtered Attribute Subspace based Bagging with Injected Randomness (FASBIR) is proposed for building ensembles of local learners, which utilizes multimodal perturbation to help generate accurate but diverse component learners. In detail, FASBIR employs the perturbation on the training data with bootstrap sampling, the perturbation on the input attributes with attribute filtering and attribute subspace selection, and the perturbation on the learning parameters with randomly configured distance metrics. A large empirical study shows that FASBIR is effective in building ensembles of nearest-neighbor classifiers, whose performance is better than that of many other ensemble algorithms.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.845396","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468246","Data mining;ensemble learning;local learner;machine learning;multimodal perturbation;nearest-neighbor classifier;stable base learner","Bagging;Decision trees;Diversity reception;Educational programs;Filtering;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Sampling methods;Training data","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);sampling methods","bootstrap sampling;data mining;ensemble learning algorithm;filtered attribute subspace;machine learning;multimodal perturbation;multiple component learner;nearest-neighbor classifier;resampling method;stable base learner","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","50","","30","","","Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we study this issue in cost-sensitive learning that considers both test costs and misclassification costs. If some attributes (tests) are too expensive in obtaining their values, it would be more cost-effective to miss out their values, similar to skipping expensive and risky tests (missing values) in patient diagnosis (classification). That is, ""missing is useful"" as missing values actually reduces the total cost of tests and misclassifications and, therefore, it is not meaningful to impute their values. We discuss and compare several strategies that utilize only known values and that ""missing is useful"" for cost reduction in cost-sensitive decision tree learning.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.188","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1524968","Index Terms- Induction;knowledge acquisition;machine learning.","Costs;Data mining;Decision trees;Knowledge acquisition;Learning systems;Life testing;Machine learning;Medical diagnosis;Medical tests;Predictive models","cost reduction;data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","cost reduction;cost-sensitive decision tree learning;data mining;machine learning;misclassification costs;missing values;patient diagnosis;real-world data sets;test costs","","51","","24","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The model is consistent with cellular, functional, information theoretic, and learning paradigms in visual pathway modeling. We demonstrate the efficiency of our model for representing different attributes of natural images like color and luminance. We compare the performance of our model in terms of quality of representation against commonly used basis, like the discrete cosine transform (DCT), independent component analysts (ICA), and principal components analysis (PCA), based on their entropies. Chrominance and luminance components of images are represented using codes having lower entropy than DCT, ICA, or PCA for similar visual quality.

Sharma","","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","20060515","2006","8","3","500","508","This paper presents a spatio-temporal approach in recognizing six universal facial expressions from visual data and using them to compute levels of interest. The classification approach relies on a two-step strategy on the top of projected facial motion vectors obtained from video sequences of facial expressions. First a linear classification bank was applied on projected optical flow vectors and decisions made by the linear classifiers were coalesced to produce a characteristic signature for each universal facial expression. The signatures thus computed from the training data set were used to train discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs) to learn the underlying model for each facial expression. The performances of the proposed facial expressions recognition were computed using five fold cross-validation on Cohn-Kanade facial expressions database consisting of 488 video sequences that includes 97 subjects. The proposed approach achieved an average recognition rate of 90.9% on Cohn-Kanade facial expressions database. Recognized facial expressions were mapped to levels of interest using the affect space and the intensity of motion around apex frame. Computed level of interest was subjectively analyzed and was found to be consistent with ""ground truth"" information in most of the cases. To further illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, and also to better understand the effects of a number of factors that are detrimental to the facial expression recognition, a number of experiments were conducted. The first empirical analysis was conducted on a database consisting of 108 facial expressions collected from TV broadcasts and labeled by human coders for subsequent analysis. The second experiment (emotion elicitation) was conducted on facial expressions obtained from 21 subjects by showing the subjects six different movies clips chosen in a manner to arouse spontaneous emotional reactions that would produce natural facial expressions.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2006.870737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632035","Emotions;face detection;hidden Markov models (HMMs);levels of interest;machine learning;universal facial expressions","Databases;Face recognition;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Image motion analysis;Information analysis;TV broadcasting;Training data;Vectors;Video sequences","emotion recognition;face recognition;hidden Markov models;image motion analysis;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;visual databases","Cohn-Kanade facial expressions database;HMM;discrete hidden Markov model training;empirical analysis;facial motion vector projection;levels of interest measurement;linear classification bank;optical flow vector projection;spatio-temporal approach;universal facial expression recognition;video sequences","","92","3","64","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To build accurate predictive models, data acquisition is usually adopted to prepare the data and complete missing values. However, due to the significant cost of doing so and the inherent correlations in the data set, acquiring correct information for all instances is prohibitive and unnecessary. An interesting and important problem that arises here is to select what kinds of instances to complete so the model built from the processed data can receive the ""maximum"" performance improvement. This problem is complicated by the reality that the costs associated with the attributes are different, and fixing the missing values of some attributes is inherently more expensive than others. Therefore, the problem becomes that given a fixed budget, what kinds of instances should be selected for preparation, so that the learner built from the processed data set can maximize its performance? In this paper, we propose a solution for this problem, and the essential idea is to combine attribute costs and the relevance of each attribute to the target concept, so that the data acquisition can pay more attention to those attributes that are cheap in price but informative for classification. To this end, we will first introduce a unique economical factor (EF) that seamlessly integrates the cost and the importance (in terms of classification) of each attribute. Then, we will propose a cost-constrained data acquisition model, where active learning, missing value prediction, and impact-sensitive instance ranking are combined for effective data acquisition. Experimental results and comparative studies from real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512039","Index Terms- Data mining;cost-sensitive;data acquisition;instance ranking.;intelligent data preparation;machine learning","Classification tree analysis;Context modeling;Costs;Data acquisition;Data mining;Decision trees;Economic forecasting;Hospitals;Learning systems;Predictive models","data acquisition;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","cost-constrained data acquisition;data mining;instance ranking;intelligent data preparation;machine learning;unique economical factor","","15","","38","","","Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As the aetiology of AIS is unknown, its risk of progression can only be predicted from measured indicators. Previous studies suggest that individual indicators of AIS do not reliably predict its risk of progression. Complex indicators with better predictive values have been developed but are unsuitable for clinical use as obtaining their values is often onerous, involving much skill and repeated measurements taken over time. Based on the hypothesis that combining common indicators of AIS using an SVC approach would produce better prediction results more quickly, we conducted a study using three datasets comprising a total of 44 moderate AIS patients (30 observed, 14 treated with brace). Of the 44 patients, 13 progressed less than 5° and 31 progressed more than 5°. One dataset comprised all the patients. A second dataset comprised all the observed patients and a third comprised all the brace-treated patients. Twenty-one radiographic and clinical indicators were obtained for each patient. The result of testing on the three datasets showed that the system achieved 100% accuracy in training and 65%-80% accuracy in testing. It outperformed a ""statistically equivalent"" logistic regression model and a stepwise linear regression model on the said datasets. It took less than 20 min per patient to measure the indicators, input their values into the system, and produce the needed results, making the system viable for use in a clinical environment.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/TITB.2005.847169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435425","Decision support systems;Lenke indicators;machine learning (ML);scoliosis progression;support vector classifiers (SVCs)","Diagnostic radiography;Linear regression;Logistics;Machine learning;Medical treatment;Spine;Static VAr compensators;Surgery;System testing;Time measurement","decision support systems;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical information systems;radiography;regression analysis;support vector machines","Lenke indicator;adolescent idiopathic scoliosis;aetiology;brace-treated patient;clinical indicator;decision support system;hypothesis;logistic regression model;machine learning;radiographic indicator;scoliosis progression risk;stepwise linear regression model;support vectors classifier;visible trunk asymmetry","Adolescent;Decision Support Systems, Clinical;Disease Progression;Female;Humans;Male;Retrospective Studies;Scoliosis","12","2","20","","","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Jumping emerging patterns (JEPs) are those itemsets whose supports increase abruptly from zero in one data set to nonzero in another data set. In this paper, we propose a fast, accurate, and less complex classifier based on a subset of JEPs, called strong jumping emerging patterns (SJEPs). The support constraint of SJEP removes potentially less useful JEPs while retaining those with high discriminating power. Previous algorithms based on the manipulation of border as well as consEPMiner cannot directly mine SJEPs. In this paper, we present a new tree-based algorithm for their efficient discovery. Experimental results show that: 1) the training of our classifier is typically 10 times faster than earlier approaches, 2) our classifier uses much fewer patterns than the JEP-classifier to achieve a similar (and, often, improved) accuracy, and 3) in many cases, it is superior to other state-of-the-art classification systems such as naive Bayes, CBA, C4.5, and bagged and boosted versions of C4.5. We argue that SJEPs are high-quality patterns which possess the most differentiating power. As a consequence, they represent sufficient information for the construction of accurate classifiers. In addition, we generalize these patterns by introducing noise-tolerant emerging patterns (NEPs) and generalized noise-tolerant emerging patterns (GNEPs). Our tree-based algorithms can be adopted to easily discover these variations. We experimentally demonstrate that SJEPs, NEPs, and GNEPs are extremely useful for building effective classifiers that can deal well with noise","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1626228","Data mining;classification;emerging patterns;frequent patterns;machine learning;mining methods and algorithms.","Buildings;Data mining;Databases;Expert systems;Itemsets;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Statistics;Supervised learning","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;tree data structures;very large databases","SJEP;consEPMiner;data mining;generalized noise-tolerant emerging patterns;pattern classification system;strong jumping emerging patterns;support constraint;tree-based algorithm","","39","","39","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The resulting HMM has a superior discrimination ability to a handcrafted model that has been published in the literature.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2005.851271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1583626","Biological sequence analysis;genetic algorithm (GA);hidden Markov model (HMM);hybrid algorithm;machine learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation error;Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Estimation error;Genetic algorithms;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;System testing","biology;genetic algorithms;hidden Markov models;probability","Baum-Welch algorithm;C. jejuni;biological sequence analysis;coding region;emission probability;genetic algorithm;hidden Markov models;promoter region;transition probability","","8","","25","","","Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Improving Prediction of Residue Solvent Accessibility with SVR and Multiple Sequence Alignment Profile","Ao Li; Xian Wang; Zhaohui Jiang; Huanqing Feng","Department of Electronic Science and Technology University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China","2005 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology 27th Annual Conference","20060410","2005","","","2595","2598","A new method based on support vector regression (SVR) has been introduced to predict the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of residues from protein primary sequences, which uses the local information of protein primary sequences as input. Different to most previous methods which are designed to predict the exposure state (exposed/buried, exposed/intermediate/buried, etc) of a particular residue according to its relative solvent accessibility, this method predicts the real value of RSA, by which more information about residue location in protein 3D structure can be retained than state assignment. Measurements for prediction performance, i.e. the mean absolute error (MAE) and correlation coefficient (CC), were compared with a former RVP-Net method, which was based on a multilayer feed-forward neural network. With 3-fold cross validation test, the MAE and CC of the SVR method for all data sets were consistently better than those obtained by the RVP-Net. In addition, we used the profile of multiple sequence alignment as input and achieved a significant improvement in prediction performance comparing with using only single sequence information. The final prediction result on the CB-513 data set by our method was 16.8% for MAE and 0.562 for CC. The results demonstrate that SVR is a useful tool for protein sequence analyses","1094-687X;1094687X","POD:0-7803-8741-4","10.1109/IEMBS.2005.1617000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1617000","Bioinformatics;Machine learning;Protein structure prediction;Relative solvent accessibility;Support vector regression","Bioinformatics;Design methodology;Feedforward neural networks;Feedforward systems;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Protein sequence;Solvents;Testing","biology computing;feedforward neural nets;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;proteins;regression analysis;support vector machines","RVP-Net method;SVR;correlation coefficient;mean absolute error;multilayer feedforward neural network;multiple sequence alignment profile;protein 3D structure;protein primary sequences;protein sequence analyses;residue location;residue solvent accessibility prediction;support vector regression","","0","","6","","","17-18 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Analysis of such data can help us identifying different clinical outcomes using only expressions of a few predictive genes. This paper presents an application of multiagent system to the analysis of gene expression data. Our goal is to find significant classification genes using simple classifiers that can be used by agents when exploring the gene expression database. We present our results on two well-known publicly available gene expression problems where we try to achieve the highest possible accuracy of classification using the smallest possible set of genes.","","POD:0-7803-8439-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2004.1403838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1403838","case based reasoning;machine learning;microarray classification;multi-agent systems","Clustering methods;Data analysis;Databases;Gene expression;Learning systems;Machine learning;Multiagent systems;Multidimensional systems;Neoplasms;Space exploration","biology computing;case-based reasoning;cellular biophysics;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;pattern classification","case based reasoning;gene expression classification;gene expression database;machine learning;microarray technology;multiagent system;predictive genes","","1","","11","","","1-5 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Ensemble-based discriminant learning with boosting for face recognition","J. Lu; K. N. Plataniotis; A. N. Venetsanopoulos; S. Z. Li","Edward S. Rogers Sr. Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Univ. of Toronto, Ont., Canada","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","20060213","2006","17","1","166","178","In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble-based approach to boost performance of traditional Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)-based methods used in face recognition. The ensemble-based approach is based on the recently emerged technique known as ""boosting"". However, it is generally believed that boosting-like learning rules are not suited to a strong and stable learner such as LDA. To break the limitation, a novel weakness analysis theory is developed here. The theory attempts to boost a strong learner by increasing the diversity between the classifiers created by the learner, at the expense of decreasing their margins, so as to achieve a tradeoff suggested by recent boosting studies for a low generalization error. In addition, a novel distribution accounting for the pairwise class discriminant information is introduced for effective interaction between the booster and the LDA-based learner. The integration of all these methodologies proposed here leads to the novel ensemble-based discriminant learning approach, capable of taking advantage of both the boosting and LDA techniques. Promising experimental results obtained on various difficult face recognition scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We believe that this work is especially beneficial in extending the boosting framework to accommodate general (strong/weak) learners.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2005.860853","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593701","Boosting;face recognition (FR);linear discriminant analysis;machine learning;mixture of linear models;small-sample-size (SSS) problem;strong learner","Authentication;Biometrics;Boosting;Engines;Face detection;Face recognition;Indexing;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine learning;Monitoring","face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence)","boosting;ensemble-based discriminant learning;face recognition;linear discriminant analysis;machine learning","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Databases, Factual;Face;Pattern Recognition, Automated","105","","59","","","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Autonomic systems adapt both to their environment and to the demands placed upon them as a consequence of the use of the system(s) within their purview. Data and voice networks function in a changing environment with varying use cases; hence, autonomic systems must be deployed with both a significant a priori knowledge base and the capability to continuously upgrade that knowledge base. The system must engage in some amount of unsupervised learning and hypothesize as to nature of its functioning. Maintenance of hypotheses and theories is intrinsic to the system, especially in evolutionary scenarios. This paper explores how knowledge maintenance is done for voice and data communications networks applications that use autonomic system approaches.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-2424-9","10.1109/DEXA.2005.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1508361","Autonomic Computing;Causal Determinacy;Causal and Developmental Morphology;Information Model;Machine Learning;Ontology;Superficial Causality","Communication system control;Computer networks;Data communication;Environmental management;Information management;Intelligent networks;Knowledge management;Ontologies;Transfer functions;Unsupervised learning","computer network management;data mining;integrated voice/data communication;telecommunication computing;unsupervised learning","autonomic computing;data communications networks;knowledge discovery;knowledge maintenance;unsupervised learning;voice networks","","5","1","19","","","22-26 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
