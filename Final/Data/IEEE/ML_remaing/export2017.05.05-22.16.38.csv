At present, there are several approaches to the problem of automatic emotion recognition based on different methods, like Bayesian classifiers, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, neural networks or k-nearest neighbors, which classify emotions using several features obtained from facial expressions, body gestures, speech or different physiological signals. In this paper, we propose a semantic classifier as a new, simple and efficient approach to the problem of automatic emotion recognition. The implementation of the semantic classifier is based on the basic, natural principles used to decrease the complexity of problems found in n-dimensional spaces: discretization, structure identification and semantic optimization. The proposed classifier exhibits some self-organizing features and supports learning by repetition, generalization and specialization. It will be used to implement a distributed and robust system for emotion recognition.","","POD:978-0-7695-3514-2","10.1109/CIMCA.2008.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5172736","Affective Computing;Classifiers;Knowledge Representation;Machine Learning;Semantics","Bayesian methods;Classification tree analysis;Crosstalk;Emotion recognition;Hypercubes;Linear discriminant analysis;Neural networks;Speech analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","computational complexity;emotion recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","Bayesian classifier;affective computing;automatic emotion recognition;body gesture;discretization;distributed system;facial expression;k-nearest neighbor;linear discriminant analysis;n-dimensional space;neural network;physiological signal;robust system;self-organizing feature;semantic classifier;semantic optimization;speech;structure identification;support vector machine","","0","","16","","","10-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed model is very general and can be applied for solution of a variety of problems. The motion patterns of objects in the scene are modeled in the form of a multivariate nonparametric probability density function of spatiotemporal variables (object locations and transition times between them). Kernel Density Estimation is used to learn this model in a completely unsupervised fashion. Learning is accomplished by observing the trajectories of objects by a static camera over extended periods of time. It encodes the probabilistic nature of the behavior of moving objects in the scene and is useful for activity analysis applications, such as persistent tracking and anomalous motion detection. In addition, the model also captures salient scene features, such as the areas of occlusion and most likely paths. Once the model is learned, we use a unified Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based framework for generating the most likely paths in the scene, improving foreground detection, persistent labeling of objects during tracking, and deciding whether a given trajectory represents an anomaly to the observed motion patterns. Experiments with real-world videos are reported which validate the proposed approach.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4569848","Machine learning;Markov Chain Monte Carlo.;Markov processes;Metropolis-Hastings;Probability and Statistics;Vision and Scene Understanding;Vision and scene understanding;kernel density estimation;machine learning;tracking","","Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;motion estimation;object detection;probability;unsupervised learning;video surveillance","Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based framework;anomalous motion detection;kernel density estimation;observed motion pattern;probabilistic modeling;probability density function;spatiotemporal variable;static camera;unsupervised fashion;visual surveillance","","73","","41","","20080718","Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Experiments on synthetic images of three different types, for which ground truth was available, as well as on real image data sets acquired for two different biological studies, for which we obtained expert manual annotations for comparison, revealed that for very low SNRs (ap2), the supervised (machine learning) methods perform best overall, closely followed by the detectors based on the so-called h-dome transform from mathematical morphology and the multiscale variance-stabilizing transform, which do not require a learning stage.

Yao","University of Birmingham, Birmingham","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","20090526","2009","21","7","999","1013","An ensemble is a group of learners that work together as a committee to solve a problem. The existing ensemble learning algorithms often generate unnecessarily large ensembles, which consume extra computational resource and may degrade the generalization performance. Ensemble pruning algorithms aim to find a good subset of ensemble members to constitute a small ensemble, which saves the computational resource and performs as well as, or better than, the unpruned ensemble. This paper introduces a probabilistic ensemble pruning algorithm by choosing a set of ldquosparserdquo combination weights, most of which are zeros, to prune the ensemble. In order to obtain the set of sparse combination weights and satisfy the nonnegative constraint of the combination weights, a left-truncated, nonnegative, Gaussian prior is adopted over every combination weight. Expectation propagation (EP) algorithm is employed to approximate the posterior estimation of the weight vector. The leave-one-out (LOO) error can be obtained as a by-product in the training of EP without extra computation and is a good indication for the generalization error. Therefore, the LOO error is used together with the Bayesian evidence for model selection in this algorithm. An empirical study on several regression and classification benchmark data sets shows that our algorithm utilizes far less component learners but performs as well as, or better than, the unpruned ensemble. Our results are very competitive compared with other ensemble pruning algorithms.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4798164","Machine learning;classification.;ensemble learning;probabilistic algorithms;regression","","Bayes methods;Gaussian processes;estimation theory;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability;regression analysis;set theory","Bayesian evidence;Gaussian posterior estimation;computational resource;data set theory;expectation propagation algorithm;generalization performance;leave-one-out error;pattern classification;predictive ensemble learning algorithm;probabilistic ensemble pruning algorithm;regression analysis;sparse combination weight","","32","","39","","20090306","July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The relationships between the target points and underlying linguistic features are trained using classification and regression tree analysis (CARTs), and this functional model is used to trace the F<sub>0</sub> trajectories when training the CARTs and to synthesize a tonal pattern from the target points predicted by the CARTs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method has low F<sub>0</sub> prediction errors. Utilization of the F<sub>0</sub> ranges measured from training samples could significantly reduce the influences of differences in voice ranges on training a speaker-independent model.

Gaussian noise and Salt and Pepper noise, in particular, are prevalent in noisy communication channels, camera and scanner sensors, and medical MRI images. It is not unusual for highly sophisticated image processing algorithms developed for clean images to malfunction when used on noisy images. For example, hidden Markov Gauss mixture models (HMGMM) have been shown to perform well in image segmentation applications, but they are quite sensitive to image noise. We propose a modified HMGMM procedure specifically designed to improve performance in the presence of noise. The key feature of the proposed procedure is the adjustment of covariance matrices in Gauss mixture vector quantizer codebooks to minimize an overall minimum discrimination information distortion (MDI). In adjusting covariance matrices, we expand or shrink their elements based on the noisy image. While most results reported in the literature assume a particular noise type, we propose a framework without assuming particular noise characteristics. Without denoising the corrupted source, we apply our method directly to the segmentation of noisy sources. We apply the proposed procedure to the segmentation of aerial images with Salt and Pepper noise and with independent Gaussian noise, and we compare our results with those of the median filter restoration method and the blind deconvolution-based method, respectively. We show that our procedure has better performance than image restoration-based techniques and closely matches to the performance of HMGMM for clean images in terms of both visual segmentation results and error rate.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2009.2019433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4957047","Covariance adjustment;Gauss mixture model (GMM);hidden Markov model (HMM);image classification;image segmentation;independent Gaussian noise;machine learning;pattern recognition;salt and pepper noise;signal and noise modeling;supervised learning","Cameras;Communication channels;Covariance matrix;Gaussian noise;Gaussian processes;Hidden Markov models;Image restoration;Image segmentation;Image sensors;Noise robustness","Gaussian noise;covariance matrices;hidden Markov models;image segmentation","Gaussian noise;aerial image segmentation;blind deconvolution-based method;camera sensors;covariance matrices;image acquisition;image noise;image processing algorithms;image restoration-based techniques;median filter restoration method;medical MRI images;minimum discrimination information distortion;noisy communication channels;processing characteristics;robust hidden Markov Gauss mixture vector quantizer;salt and pepper noise;scanner sensors","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Markov Chains;Normal Distribution;Pattern Recognition, Automated","5","","36","","20090519","July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The study of ASL phonemes is not only interesting to linguists, but also useful for scalability in recognition by machines. Since machine perception is different than human perception, this paper learns the basic units for ASL directly from data. Comparing with previous studies, our approach computes a set of data-driven units (fenemes) discriminatively from the results of segmental feature selection. The learning iterates the following two steps: first apply discriminative feature selection segmentally to the signs, and then tie the most similar temporal segments to re-train. Intuitively, the sign parts indistinguishable to machines are merged to form basic units, which we call ASL fenemes. Experiments on publicly available ASL recognition data show that the extracted data-driven fenemes are meaningful, and recognition using those fenemes achieves improved accuracy at reduced model complexity.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4960694","American Sign Language;Feature Selection;Machine Learning","Deafness;Handicapped aids;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Machine learning;Natural languages;Scalability;Signal processing algorithms;Speech recognition;Vocabulary","natural language interfaces;natural languages","American sign language;discriminative segmental feature selection;machine perception;natural language;phonemic model;reduced model complexity","","7","","24","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This places a burden on the compiler to schedule the instructions to take maximum advantage of the underlying hardware. Superblocks - a straight-line sequence of code with a single entry point and multiple possible exit points - are a commonly used scheduling region within compilers. Superblock scheduling is NP-complete, and is done suboptimally in production compilers using a greedy algorithm coupled with a heuristic. The heuristic is usually handcrafted, a potentially time-consuming process. In this paper, we show that supervised machine learning techniques can be used to semiautomate the construction of heuristics for superblock scheduling. In our approach, labeled training data were produced using an optimal superblock scheduler. A decision tree learning algorithm was then used to induce a heuristic from the training data. The automatically constructed decision tree heuristic was compared against the best previously proposed, handcrafted heuristics for superblock scheduling on the SPEC 2000 and MediaBench benchmark suites. On these benchmark suites, the decision tree heuristic reduced the number of superblocks that were not optimally scheduled by up to 38 percent, and led to improved performance on some architectural models and competitive performance on others.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752820","Pipeline processors;compilers;constraint satisfaction.;heuristics design;machine learning","","learning (artificial intelligence);pipeline processing;processor scheduling","MediaBench;SPEC 2000;constraint satisfaction;decision tree learning;greedy algorithm;pipelined processing;straight-line sequence;superblock instruction scheduling problem;superblock scheduling;supervised machine learning","","5","","26","","20090119","Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a signal classification method based on the data compression principle that the accurate estimation in the classification problems induces the optimal signal models for data compression. The method formulates the classification problem as an optimization problem, where a so called ""classification gain'' is maximized. In order to circumvent the difficulties in integer optimization, we propose a continuous relaxation based algorithm.

A novel perception-inspired nonmetric partial similarity measure is introduced, which is potentially useful in dealing with the concerned problems because it can help capture the prominent partial similarities that are dominant in human perception.

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a popular analysis technique used to project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while maximizing class separability. Although this technique is widely used in many applications, it suffers from overfitting when the number of training examples is on the same order as the dimension of the original data space. When overfitting occurs, the direction of the LDA solution can be dominated by low-energy noise and therefore the solution becomes non-robust to unseen data. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, energy-constrained discriminant analysis (ECDA), that overcomes the limitations of LDA by finding lower dimensional projections that maximize inter-class separability, while also preserving signal energy. Our results show that the proposed technique results in higher classification rates when compared to comparable methods. The results are given in terms of SAR image classification, however the algorithm is broadly applicable and can be generalized to any classification problem.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4960325","Dimensionality reduction;discriminant analysis;machine learning;pattern recognition;principal components analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Covariance matrix;Image classification;Laboratories;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition;Principal component analysis;Signal analysis","data handling","SAR image classification;class separability;classification rates;dimensionality reduction algorithms;energy-constrained discriminant analysis;high-dimensional data;inter-class separability;linear discriminant analysis;low-energy noise","","0","","15","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been proven that Kalman filter gives a good estimation when tested on various tracking systems. However, unsatisfying tracking results may be produced due to different real-time conditions. These conditions include: inter-object occlusion and separation which are observed when objects are being tracked in real-time. Thus, it is challenging to handle for the classical Kalman filter. In this paper, we proposed an idea of intelligent feature-guided tracking using Kalman filtering.

One approach to this problem is to extract appropriate features and, often, one selects a feature extraction method based on the inference algorithm. Here, we formalize a general framework for feature extraction, based on partial least squares, in which one can select a user-defined criterion to compute projection directions. The framework draws together a number of existing results and provides additional insights into several popular feature extraction methods. Two new sparse kernel feature extraction methods are derived under the framework, called sparse maximal alignment (SMA) and sparse maximal covariance (SMC), respectively. Key advantages of these approaches include simple implementation and a training time which scales linearly in the number of examples. Furthermore, one can project a new test example using only k kernel evaluations, where k is the output dimensionality. Computational results on several real-world data sets show that SMA and SMC extract features which are as predictive as those found using other popular feature extraction methods. Additionally, on large text retrieval and face detection data sets, they produce features which match the performance of the original ones in conjunction with a support vector machine.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4553716","Feature extraction or construction;Machine learning;feature extraction;kernel methods;partial least squares (PLS).","","covariance matrices;face recognition;feature extraction;image retrieval;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;sparse matrices;support vector machines;text analysis","face detection;inference algorithm;machine learning;partial least squares;sparse kernel feature extraction method;sparse maximal alignment;sparse maximal covariance;support vector machine;text retrieval;training data","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Databases, Factual;Face;Humans;Least-Squares Analysis;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;ROC Curve","28","","47","","20080627","Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition, this approach, without any system modification, is easily applicable to other corpora with different tag sets and annotation guidelines. The three different models and their combinations are evaluated on three corpora over a wide range of conditions. The eojeol-unit and syllable-unit models compensate for the weaknesses of the morpheme-unit model. The eojeol-unit model performed efficiently, and improved the precision. The syllable-unit model improved in precision as well, showing a particularly robust performance in treating unknown words.

Another important aspect of CASAS is that it can adapt to changes in the discovered patterns based on the resident implicit and explicit feedback and can automatically update its model to reflect the changes.

Recently it is treated as a common solution for modeling language variability. Textual entailment captures a broad range of semantic oriented inferences needed for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, like Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE), text summarization and Machine Translation (MT). Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) as one of the fundamental problems in those natural language processing applications has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This paper proposes a new method for textual entailment measure which is based on lexical, shallow syntactic analysis combined with fuzzy set theory. Further we model lexical and semantic features based on this method and perform textual entailment recognition using machine learning algorithm.

Finite Student's t-mixture models have recently emerged as a heavier-tailed, robust alternative to Gaussian mixture models, overcoming these hurdles. To exploit these merits of Student's t-mixture models in the context of a sequential data modeling setting, we introduce, in this paper, a novel hidden Markov model where the hidden state distributions are considered to be finite mixtures of multivariate Student's t-densities. We derive an algorithm for the model parameters estimation under a maximum likelihood framework, assuming full, diagonal, and factor-analyzed covariance matrices.

Recent studies propose an alternative technique for network traffic classification utilizing statistical characteristics of network flows in classification. Most of these studies focus on classifying flows when flows have finished. This kind of classification is not sufficient for quality of service management purposes, therefore network flows have to be classified as early as possible. This paper introduces a two-phased classification method which is capable of classifying network flows early in the connection and providing a secondary classification phase to improve the classification accuracy. A simple K-Means clustering technique is utilized in both classification phases. The classifier was trained and evaluated using manually generated training and evaluation datasets. According to the results two-phased classifier classified 97.8% of target applications correctly and was able to detect untrained application flows at high precision.

In other words, SRM can be viewed as the sub-optimal Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding that, however, owns very low computational complexity O(d log d) and highly efficient implementation that uses only O(d) random bits, making it a promising candidate for practical, large scale applications where efficiency and speed of computation are highly critical.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959960","Johnson-Lindenstrauss;Low-distortion embedding;compressed sensing;dimensionality reduction;machine learning","Bridges;Compressed sensing;Computational complexity;Design engineering;Discrete cosine transforms;Distortion measurement;Gallium nitride;Large-scale systems;Random variables;Vectors","computational complexity;matrix algebra;random processes;signal processing","Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma;computational complexity;dimensionality reduction transform;large scale compressed sensing applications;measurement operators;structurally random matrices;suboptimal Johnson-Lindenstrauss","","5","","12","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Following this approach, we explore the possibility of replacing the Hotelling detector within the CHO with an algorithm that learns the relationship between measured channel features and human observer scores. Specifically, we develop a channelized support vector machine (CSVM) which we compare to the CHO in terms of its ability to predict human-observer performance. In the examples studied, we find that the CSVM is better able to generalize to unseen images than the CHO, and therefore may represent a useful improvement on the CHO methodology, while retaining its essential features.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2008.2008956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781568","Channelized Hotelling observer (CHO);image quality;machine learning;numerical observer;support vector machine (SVM);task based image evaluation","Biomedical imaging;Detectors;Humans;Image processing;Image quality;Lesions;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Medical diagnostic imaging;Support vector machines","biomedical imaging;medical computing;support vector machines;wounds","channel feature measurement;channelized Hotelling observer;channelized support vector machine;human-observer performance prediction;image quality assessment;lesion-detection task;numerical observer;system-identification","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Diagnostic Imaging;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Monte Carlo Method;Observation","16","","29","","20090210","July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We analyze relevance vector machines (RVMs) for classification problems and observe that adopting the same prior for different classes may lead to unstable solutions. In order to tackle this problem, a signed and truncated Gaussian prior is adopted over every weight in PCVMs, where the sign of prior is determined by the class label, i.e., +1 or -1. The truncated Gaussian prior not only restricts the sign of weights but also leads to a sparse estimation of weight vectors, and thus controls the complexity of the model. In PCVMs, the kernel parameters can be optimized simultaneously within the training algorithm. The performance of PCVMs is extensively evaluated on four synthetic data sets and 13 benchmark data sets using three performance metrics, error rate (ERR), area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (AUC), and root mean squared error (RMSE). We compare PCVMs with soft-margin support vector machines (SVM<sub>Soft</sub>), hard-margin support vector machines (SVM<sub>Hard</sub>), SVM with the kernel parameters optimized by PCVMs (SVM<sub>PCVM</sub>), relevance vector machines (RVMs), and some other baseline classifiers. Through five replications of twofold cross-validation F test, i.e., 5 times 2 cross-validation F test, over single data sets and Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc test to compare these algorithms over multiple data sets, we notice that PCVMs outperform other algorithms, including SVM<sub>Soft</sub>, SVM<sub>Hard</sub>, RVM, and SVM<sub>PCVM</sub>, on most of the data sets under the three metrics, especially under AUC. Our results also reveal that the performance of SVM<sub>PCVM</sub> is slightly better than SVM<sub>Soft</sub>, implying that the parameter optimization algorithm in PCVMs is better than cross validation in terms of performance and computational complexity. In this paper, we also discuss the superio- - rity of PCVMs' formulation using maximum a posteriori (MAP) analysis and margin analysis, which explain the empirical success of PCVMs.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2009.2014161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4840491","Bayesian classification;machine learning;probabilistic classification model;support vector machine","","Gaussian processes;computational complexity;error analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation;mean square error methods;probability;support vector machines","baseline classifiers;classification problems;error rate;kernel parameters;parameter optimization algorithm;performance metrics;probabilistic classification vector machines;receiver operating characteristic;relevance vector machines;root mean squared error","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","29","","27","","20090424","June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This project seeks to improve elevator call time responsiveness by utilizing the concept that traffic flows generally form definable patterns that can be used to predict future traffic flow behaviors. A feed-forward neural network-based control algorithm has been developed that can approximate elevator call patterns by learning to associate time of day with specific call locations. This algorithm was tested against fuzzy patterns of elevator calls in which the randomly generated calls were biased towards certain floors at certain times of day. When the average neural network controlled call times of 10 such fuzzy sets were compared to the typical scenario of the elevator returning to the first floor after each call, a 42% improvement in elevator call time responsiveness was observed. It is thereby suggested that a machine learning enabled-elevator control system could result in increased user satisfaction by reducing wait times by helping to ensure that the elevator is at the most likely place the elevator will be called from prior to an individual even pushing the call button. The utility of such an algorithm is likely further enhanced, however, by the fact that having the elevator in the most likely call location can also lead to significant energy savings in that the elevator will need to travel less to pick up prospective passengers.","","POD:978-1-4244-2347-7","10.1109/LISAT.2009.5031561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5031561","Control Systems;Machine Learning;Neural Networks","Artificial neural networks;Communication system traffic control;Delay;Elevators;Feedforward neural networks;Feedforward systems;Fuzzy sets;Neural networks;Test pattern generators;Testing","feedforward neural nets;fuzzy control;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);lifts;neurocontrollers","artificial neural network control mechanism;elevator call time responsiveness;elevator traffic flow;enabled-elevator control system;feed-forward neural network-based control algorithm;fuzzy set theory;machine learning","","1","","6","","","1-1 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The syntactic cues can help characterizing large syntactic patterns such as appositions and lists which are not necessarily marked by prosody.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960679","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4960679","Machine Learning;Punctuation;Speech Processing","Boosting;Broadcasting;Classification tree analysis;Computer science;Data mining;Decision trees;Neural networks;Predictive models;Speech processing;Testing","linguistics;natural language processing;speech recognition;text analysis","English broadcast news;automatic speech recognition systems;downstream text processing;information extraction;linguistics;machine translation;speech transcription","","2","","11","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the robot maneuvers too close to an obstacle, it increases the probability of an accident. Preventing this is crucial in dynamic environments, where the obstacles, such as other UAVs, are moving. This kind of safe navigation is needed in any autonomous movement application but it is of a vital importance in applications such as automated transportation of nuclear or chemical waste. This paper presents the Maximum Margin Search using a Convex Hull construction (MMS-CH), an algorithm for a fast construction of a maximum margin between sets of obstacles and its maintenance as the input data are dynamically altered. This calculation of the safest path is inspired by the Support Vector Machines (SVM). It utilizes the convex hull construction to preprocess the input data and uses the boundaries of the hulls to search for the optimal margin. The MMS-CH algorithm takes advantage of the elementary geometrical properties of the 2-dimensional Euclidean space resulting in 1) significant reduction of the problem complexity by eliminating irrelevant data; 2) computationally less expensive approach to maximum margin calculation than standard SVM-based techniques; and 3) inexpensive recomputation of the solution suitable for real time dynamic applications.","2156-2318;21562318","POD:978-1-4244-2799-4","10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5138351","Autonomous Navigation;Convex Hull;Machine Learning;Support Vector Machines","Accidents;Chemicals;Mobile robots;Navigation;Remotely operated vehicles;Support vector machines;Transportation;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicle safety","collision avoidance;convex programming;mobile robots;probability;remotely operated vehicles;search problems;support vector machines","2D Euclidean space;SVM-inspired dynamic safe navigation;convex hull construction;elementary geometrical property;maximum margin search;mobile robot navigation;probability;support vector machine;unmanned autonomous vehicle","","0","","17","","","25-27 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By inferring how cells evolve in individual tumors, a process called cancer progression, we may be able to identify important mutational events for different tumor types, potentially leading to new therapeutics and diagnostics. Prior work has shown that it is possible to infer frequent progression pathways by using gene expression profiles to estimate ldquodistancesrdquo between tumors. Here, we apply gene network models to improve these estimates of evolutionary distance by controlling for correlations among coregulated genes. We test three variants of this approach: one using an optimized best-fit network, another using sampling to infer a high-confidence subnetwork, and one using a modular network inferred from clusters of similarly expressed genes. Application to lung cancer and breast cancer microarray data sets shows small improvements in phylogenies when correcting from the optimized network and more substantial improvements when correcting from the sampled or modular networks. Our results suggest that a network correction approach improves estimates of tumor similarity, but sophisticated network models are needed to control for the large hypothesis space and sparse data currently available.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2008.126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4695821","Biology and genetics;Graphs and networks;Machine learning;Trees;graphs and networks;machine learning.;trees","","biological organs;cancer;cellular biophysics;genetics;gynaecology;lung;medical computing;molecular biophysics;tumours","breast cancer;cancer cells;cancer progression;diagnostics;gene expression profiles;gene network models;lung cancer;microarray data;modular network;mutations;network-based inference;phylogenies;therapeutics;tumors;uncontrolled cell growth","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Breast Neoplasms;Cluster Analysis;Disease Progression;E2F Transcription Factors;Female;Gene Regulatory Networks;Genetic Variation;Humans;Lung Neoplasms;Models, Genetic;Models, Statistical;Neoplasm Proteins;Neoplasms;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Phylogeny;Reproducibility of Results","8","1","33","","20081209","April-June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Statistical learning methods have been used to build generative shape models based on reconstructive shape parameters extracted from microscope image collections. However, such parametric modeling approaches are usually limited to simple shapes and easily-modeled parameter distributions. Moreover, to maximize the reconstruction accuracy, significant effort is required to design models for specific datasets or patterns. We have therefore developed an instance-based approach to model biological shapes within a shape space built upon diffeomorphic measurement. We also designed a recursive interpolation algorithm to probabilistically synthesize new shape instances using the shape space model and the original instances. The method is quite generalizable and therefore can be applied to most nuclear, cell and protein object shapes, in both 2D and 3D.","1945-7928;19457928","POD:978-1-4244-3931-7","10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193141","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5193141","Generative models;location proteomics;machine learning;microscopy;nuclear shape;shape interpolation","Algorithm design and analysis;Biological system modeling;Cells (biology);Extraterrestrial measurements;Image reconstruction;Microscopy;Parametric statistics;Shape measurement;Statistical learning;Systems biology","biology computing;cellular biophysics;learning (artificial intelligence);microscopy;molecular biophysics;probability;proteins;recursive estimation;statistical analysis","biological object shapes;biological shape modeling;cell shape;complex cell behaviors;diffeomorphic measurement;instance-based generative modeling;microscope image collections;nuclear shape;parametric modeling;protein shape;reconstruction accuracy;reconstructive shape parameters;recursive interpolation algorithm;shape space model;statistical learning","","6","","17","","","June 28 2009-July 1 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
