One type of such fragments is splice-junction (intron-exon or exon-intron) sites. Detection of splice-junction sites in DNA sequences is important for successful gene prediction. In this paper, support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification of DNA sequences and splice-site recognition. For optimal classification, four position-independent k-mer frequency based methods for mapping DNA sequences into SVM feature space are analyzed. Classification is performed using SVM power series kernels. Kernel parameters are optimized using a modification of the Nelder-Mead (downhill simplex) optimization method. Precision of classification is evaluated using F-measure, which is a combination of precision and recall metrics. Best classification results are achieved using 4-mers for exon-intron dataset (78%) and 6-mers for intron-exon dataset (70%) using 4-nucleotide frequencies.","","POD:978-0-7695-3109-0","10.1109/CISIS.2008.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606754","bioinformatics;feature mapping;k-mer frequency;machine learning;splice site recognition;support vector machine","Bioinformatics;DNA;Frequency;Genetics;Kernel;Optimization methods;Proteins;Sequences;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","DNA;biology computing;genetics;molecular biophysics;pattern classification;support vector machines","DNA sequence;F-measure;Nelder-Mead optimization;bioinformatics;gene prediction;k-mer frequency based mapping;optimal classification;power series kernel;splice site recognition;splice-junction;support vector machine","","1","","33","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Continuous domains form from a single-chain segment and discontinuous domains are composed of two or more chain segments. Richardson identified approximately 100 domains in her review. Her assignment was based on the concepts that the domain would be independently stable and/or could undergo rigid-body-like movements with respect to the entire protein. There are now several instances where structurally similar domains occur in different proteins in the absence of noticeable sequence similarity. Possibly, the most notable of such domains is the trios-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel. With the increase in the number of known sequences, computer algorithms are required to identify the discontinuous domain of an unknown protein chain in order to determine its structure and function. We have developed a novel algorithm for discontinuous-domain boundary prediction based on a machine learning algorithm and interresidue contact interactions values. We have used 415 proteins, including 100 discontinuous-domain chains for training. There is no method available that is designed solely on a sequence based for the prediction of discontinuous domain. Domain discovery performed significantly well compared to the structure-based methods like structural classification of proteins (SCOP), class, architecture, topology and homologous superfamily (CATH), and domain maker (DOMAK).","1536-1241;15361241","","10.1109/TNB.2008.2002283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4618629","Discontinuous domain;domain boundary;machine learning;protein domain","","biology computing;learning (artificial intelligence);proteins","class, architecture, topology and homologous superfamily;discontinuous-domain proteins;domain maker;interresidue contact interactions;machine learning algorithm;sequence similarity;structural classification of proteins;trios-phosphate isomerase barrel","Algorithms;Amino Acid Sequence;Artificial Intelligence;Information Storage and Retrieval;Molecular Sequence Data;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Protein Structure, Tertiary;Proteins;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Analysis, Protein","1","","24","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To help enforce legitimate contents communicated in chat environments, IM monitoring systems have been developed for monitoring chat messages. Although most of these systems can provide good monitoring functions, they only provide simple message analysis features such as browsing and simple keyword-based searching of the recorded messages. In this paper, we propose a system, called IMAnalysis, that supports intelligent chat message analysis using text mining techniques. The IMAnalysis system provides functions on chat message retrieval, social network analysis and topic analysis. Chat message retrieval provides general browsing and retrieval support.

Condition monitoring can significantly reduce maintenance costs and the risk of unexpected failures through the early detection of potential risks. Several techniques are used to classify the condition of machines. This paper presents a new case study on Hybrid and Non-Hybrid classifiers in on-line condition monitoring of induction motors. Advantages of the system include improved performer of fault classification. The database was developed through a simplified mathematical model of the machine considering the effects caused by asymmetries in the phase impedances of motors. A comparative analysis is presented for simulation using single classifiers (based on the neural networks, k-Nearest neighbor and Naive Bayes), Non-Hybrid classifiers (based on the Bagging and Boosting) and Hybrid (Stacking) approaches.

Machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied in mining data patterns. However, one of the main obstacles of applying them for design pattern detection is the difficulty of collecting training examples. Unlike other applications, a design pattern instance typically includes a group of classes with certain relationships. Thus, the possible combinations of the group of classes can be enormous which results in huge training sets making the application of machine learning algorithms impracticable. In this paper, we propose an innovative method using matrix transformations to cluster the training examples. Our method can significantly reduce the size of training examples, thus making it possible to be efficiently applied in machine learning algorithm.","","POD:978-1-4244-2659-1","10.1109/IRI.2008.4583034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4583034","decision tree;design pattern;detection;machine learning;training example","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification tree analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data mining;Decision trees;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Software systems;Weather forecasting","","","","0","","15","","","13-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system first builds a class-specific codebook of local fragments of contour using a novel formulation of chamfer matching. These local fragments allow recognition that is robust to within-class variation, pose changes, and articulation. Boosting combines these fragments into a cascaded sliding-window classifier, and mean shift is used to select strong responses as a final set of detection. We show how learning can be performed iteratively on both training and test sets to bootstrap an improved classifier. We compare with other methods based on contour and local descriptors in our detailed evaluation over 17 challenging categories and obtain highly competitive results.

The aim of our work is to provide a simple unsupervised method to assess the fall risk of elderly persons as measured by reference clinical fall risk assessment scores. Our method uses parameters computed by spectral analysis on triaxial accelerometer data recorded in a clinical setting, and is evaluated using simple logistic regression classifier models with reference to three clinical reference scores. The overall prediction accuracy of the models ranges from 65.5â€“89.1%, with sensitivity and specificity between 78.5â€“99% and 15.4â€“60.4%, respectively. Our results show that our simple method can be used to detect persons with a high fall risk with a fair to good predictive accuracy when tested against common clinical reference scores.

A simulator consists of the neural networks which directly can learn actual behaviors of the latest hardware and emulates them without physical modeling. On the other hand, the controller of the hardware is trained with the simulator by the reinforcement learning method to realize the optimal control for the target task, and applied to the real hardware. Then, as long as the iteration of these processes is simultaneously performed, the system can automatically generate the optimal controller without any works even when hardware constitution is changed or switched. In this manner, the real hardware and the simulator affect each other to make the system adaptable. Furthermore, in the processes of sampling and supplying hardware data, we put a buffering component. It keeps the latest data of the hardware and supplies non-biased data to the simulator. As an example of the proposal method, we pick up the pendulum swing-up problem. In the experiments, firstly, the optimization process performs step by step for the initial hardware constitution and the basic idea of the method is evaluated.

However, the connotation of labeling in ranking is quite different from that in classification. Specifically, the labeling of samples for ranking is usually incomplete, i.e. only a part of samples are labeled. In order to remedy this methodological gap, in this paper we propose a hybrid learning framework, called fuzzy-label learning, which consists of two layers. First, we utilize a label-propagation algorithm to estimate those labels of unlabeled samples by their neighborhoods. Second, we adopt RankBoost on the samples with fuzzy labels. Experiments with five-fold cross-validation using the Letor benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid learning framework can definitively improve the search performance achieved by the RankBoost algorithm for Web information retrieval.","","POD:978-1-4244-2310-1","10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4590415","Fuzzy Set;Machine Learning","Degradation;Face recognition;Fuzzy sets;Information retrieval;Labeling;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms","Internet;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","Letor benchmark datasets;RankBoost algorithm;Web information retrieval;five-fold cross-validation;fuzzy-label learning;hybrid learning framework;label-propagation algorithm;machine learning techniques","","0","1","15","","","7-11 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is achieved by minimizing the inconsistency between two similarity/dissimilarity measures, one for the input data and the other for the embedded data, via a separate matching objective function. Based on this idea, a new dimensionality reduction method called twin kernel embedding (TKE) is proposed. TKE addresses the problem of visualizing non-vectorial data that is difficult for conventional methods in practice due to the lack of efficient vectorial representation. TKE solves this problem by minimizing the inconsistency between the similarity measures captured respectively by their kernel gram matrices in the two spaces. In the implementation, by optimizing a nonlinear objective function using the gradient descent algorithm, a local minimum can be reached. The results obtained include both the optimal similarity preserving embedding and the appropriate values for the hyperparameters of the kernel. Experimental evaluation on real non-vectorial datasets confirmed the effectiveness of TKE. TKE can be applied to other types of data beyond those mentioned in this paper whenever suitable measures of similarity/dissimilarity can be defined on the input data.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479481","Clustering;Machine learning;Visualization","","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence)","dimensionality reduction algorithms;embedded data;gradient descent algorithm;kernel gram matrices;low dimensional embedding space;nonlinear objective function;nonvectorial data;separate matching objective function;twin kernel embedding;vectorial representation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Decision Support Techniques;Pattern Recognition, Automated","11","","22","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A model specie automatically infers models of a hidden physical system by the use of gene expression programming (GEP). A parameter specie simultaneously optimizes the parameters of the inferred models according to a specified target vector. Training vectors required for modelling are automatically provided online by the interplay between the two coevolving species and the physical system. At every generation, only the estimated fittest individual of the parameter specie is executed on the physical system. This approach thus limits both the evaluation time, the wear out and the potential hazards normally associated with direct online evolution (DOE) where every individual has to be evaluated on the physical system. Additionally, the approach enables continuous system identification and adaptation during normal operation. Features of IDOE are illustrated by inferring models of a simplified, robotic arm, and further optimizing the parameters of the system according to a target position of the end effector.

The genetic algorithm is used to improve the set of variable-rule during the process of traffic signal control. The genetic algorithm is a part of the signal control process instead of calculating the optimal scheme of signal control.

The machine learning method is trained here on compounds from the Elsevier Molecular Design Ltd (MDL) Information Systems' drug data report (MDDR) for five diverse protein targets (cyclooxygenase-2, dihydrofolatereductase, thrombin, HIV-reverse transcriptase and antagonists of the estrogen receptor). Each classified ligand is represented using an optimized set of two dimensional topological descriptors. Then the trend vectors are used to divide the whole set of ligands into two groups: 1) molecules predicted to be active, and 2) those predicted to be inactive. Training and predicted activities were treated as binary. The accuracy of the method is comparable to other existing prediction tools (such as support vector machines, or random forest), whereas it provides significantly higher speed and portability. The accuracy of prediction (precision) reaches 60% on heterogeneous source data. As a consequence, the method can be easily applied to large commercial compounds collections.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3191-5","10.1109/BIOTECHNO.2008.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561135","Chemical Descriptors;Compound Identification;MDL Drug Data Report;Machine-learning methods;Trend Vectors;Virtual High-Throughput Screening","Bioinformatics;Databases;Drugs;Inhibitors;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Proteins;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","biology computing;enzymes;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics","HIV-reverse transcriptase;TVscreen;cyclooxygenase-2;dihydrofolatereductase;drug data report;estrogen receptor;large commercial compounds collections;ligand;machine learning;protein;thrombin;trend vector virtual screening","","1","","14","","","June 29 2008-July 5 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While this is suitable for most applications, they tend to neglect other desirable properties, such as the ability to induce novel knowledge or to show new points of view of well-established concepts. An approach to overcome these limitations involves using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to build knowledge rules with specific properties specified by the user. In this paper, we report a research work that combined evolutionary algorithms and ranking composition methods for multi-objective optimization. In this approach, candidate solutions are built, evaluated and ranked according to their performance in each individual objective. Then rankings are composed into a single ranking which reflects the candidate solutions' ability to solve the multi-objective problem considering all objectives simultaneously. We investigate the behavior of 5 ranking composition methods. These methods are compared and we conclude that all of the studied ranking composition methods provide good balance of objectives. Moreover, for the 11 datasets analyzed, we conclude condorcet is the only method which performs statistically better than other methods.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3326-1","10.1109/HIS.2008.154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4626685","Evolutionary Computation;Machine Learning;Multi-objective Optimization;Ranking Composition;Rule Learning","Application software;Buildings;Computer science;Data analysis;Data mining;Evolutionary computation;Hybrid intelligent systems;Mathematics;Optimization methods;Performance analysis","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence)","knowledge rules;multi objective evolutionary algorithm;multi objective optimization;ranking composition methods;symbolic classifiers;symbolic supervised learning","","1","","9","","","10-12 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We suggest describing the documents not directly by selected multimodal features (audio, visual, or text) but rather by considering cross-document similarities relative to their multimodal characteristics. This idea leads us to propose a particular form of dissimilarity space that is adapted to the asymmetric classification problem and, in turn, to the query-by-example and relevance feedback paradigm, widely used in information retrieval. Based on the proposed dissimilarity space, we then define various strategies to fuse modalities through a kernel-based learning approach. The problem of automatic kernel setting to adapt the learning process to the queries is also discussed. The properties of our strategies are studied and validated on artificial data. In a second phase, a large annotated video corpus (i.e., TRECVID '05) indexed by visual, audio, and text features is considered to evaluate the overall performance of the dissimilarity space and fusion strategies.

This work is an attempt to shed more light on the driving forces behind the initiations of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). This is still a big mystery in this field and in this work we have analysed years of data relating to one particular feature, filaments, to determine if an association between filaments and the eruptions of CMEs can be drawn. The resulting association set has been fed to a powerful machine learning algorithm to determine if CMEs can be predicted solely based on filaments.

We present a unique insight into addressing class imbalance for classification problems that involve three or more categories, i.e. non-binary. This study is different than related works in the literature because most works focus on addressing class imbalance only for binary classification problems, even if it means transforming a non-binary dataset into a binary classification problem. We propose an effective, yet simple approach to alleviating class imbalance issues when the classification problem involves more than two classes. The process, with four different methods, is based on applying random undersampling and random oversampling to different parts of the dataset for achieving better classification performance. The proposed data sampling methods are evaluated in the context of two real-world datasets obtained from the UCI Repository for Machine Learning Databases, and two commonly used classification algorithms: C4.5 and RIPPER. Our results demonstrate that the multi-group classification accuracy increases significantly in most cases after the proposed data sampling methods are applied.

However, this assumption is commonly violated in practical fields. The situation where the training and test data are generated from different distributions is so-called covariate shift. In natural language processing, it is highly possible to occur covariate shift due to the size of sample space. Natural language data have theoretically infinite size, which causes that the distribution of training data can not reflect that of entire data. In this paper, we try to verify that the performance of methods on natural language processing can be improved by reducing error from covariate shift. For this purpose, we propose the importance weighted k-NN for base noun detection. In the proposed method, the weights are set as a difference between the training and test distribution. Theoretically, the performance under covariate shift can be improved using importance weight method.

We also proposed the support vector regression correlation ensemble (SVRCE) method for enhanced classification of affect intensities. SVRCE uses an ensemble of classifiers each trained using a feature subset tailored toward classifying a single affect class. The ensemble is combined with affect correlation information to enable better prediction of emotive intensities. Experiments were conducted on four test beds encompassing web forums, blogs, and online stories. The results revealed that learned n-grams were more effective than lexicon-based affect representations. The findings also indicated that SVRCE outperformed comparison techniques, including Pace regression, semantic orientation, and WordNet models.

However, the results from the ontology learning process do not fully satisfy the users at present. An important problem is that there is a lack of quantitative and comparative data about the efficiency of techniques and technique combinations applied to ontology learning. In this paper we present a quantitative comparison of technique combinations for concept extraction and a software system (OntoLancs) to support the evaluation of techniques. By applying OntoLancs, users are able to assist the process of building ontologies by semi- automatically acquiring concepts from large-scale domain document collections and experiment with different combinations of knowledge acquisition techniques to refine and organize domain concepts into a taxonomy. Quantitative and comparative studies about the performance of several techniques and user experiences indicate the applicability and usefulness of our approach.","","POD:978-0-7695-3131-1","10.1109/ICIS.2008.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529841","Ensemble Methods;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Ontology Learning","Filtering;Filters;Frequency;Guidelines;Humans;Information science;Large-scale systems;Ontologies;Software systems;Terminology","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","OntoLancs;concept acquisition techniques;concept extraction;ontology learning process;software system","","14","","18","","","14-16 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DVC proposed a dramatic structural change to video coding by shifting the majority of complexity conventionally residing in the encoder towards the decoder. Nevertheless, these kinds of architectures have some serious limitations that hinder its practical application. The uses of a feedback channel between the encoder and the decoder requires an interactive decoding procedure which is a limitation for certain applications such as offline processing. On the other hand, the decoder needs an efficient way to estimate the probability of error without assuming the availability of the original video at the decoder. In this paper we investigate a first approximation to solve both problems based on the use of machine learning to extract the knowledge that exits between the residual frame and the number of requests over this feedback channel. Exploiting this correlation gives us a more practical architecture without higher complexity encoders.

Our method finds frequent purchase patterns among high-LTV users and recommends items for a new user that simulate the found patterns. Using survival analysis techniques, we efficiently find the patterns from log data. Furthermore, we infer a user's interests from the purchase history based on maximum entropy models and use the interests to improve recommendation.

Experimental results have shown that such an approach can perform much better than single-task techniques, especially when few examples per task are available. However, a possible drawback may be computational complexity. For instance, when using regularization networks, complexity scales as the cube of the overall number of data associated with all the tasks. In this paper, an efficient computational scheme is derived for a widely applied class of multi-task kernels. More precisely, a quadratic loss is assumed and the multi-task kernel is the sum of a common term and a task-specific one. The proposed algorithm performs online learning recursively updating the estimates as new data become available. The learning problem is formulated in a Bayesian setting. The optimal estimates are obtained by solving a sequence of subproblems which involve projection of random variables onto suitable subspaces.

In contrast to classical methods, biclustering has the ability to cluster a group of genes together with a group of conditions (replicates, set of patients or drug compounds). However, since the problem is NP-complex, most algorithms use heuristic search functions and therefore might converge towards local maxima. By using the results of biclustering on discrete data as a starting point for a local search function on continuous data, our algorithm avoids the problem of heuristic initialization. Similar to OPSM, our algorithm aims to detect biclusters whose rows and columns can be ordered such that row values are growing across the bicluster's columns and vice-versa. Results have been generated on the yeast genome (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), a human cancer dataset and random data. Results on the yeast genome showed that 89% of the one hundred biggest non-overlapping biclusters were enriched with Gene Ontology annotations. A comparison with OPSM and ISA demonstrated a better efficiency when using gene and condition orders. We present results on random and real datasets that show the ability of our algorithm to capture statistically significant and biologically relevant biclusters.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2007.70251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359900","Bioinformatics (genome or protein) databases;Data and knowledge visualization;Data mining;Graph and tree search strategies;Machine learning","","DNA;arrays;biochemistry;cancer;data analysis;data mining;genetics;medical computing;microorganisms;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;statistical analysis;tumours","DNA microarray analysis;Gene Ontology annotations;NP-complex problem;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;biclustering approach;continuous data;data mining;discrete data;gene expression data analysis;human cancer dataset;local search function;order-preserving submatrices;pattern detection;random data;yeast genome","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Gene Expression Profiling;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Proteome;Signal Transduction","4","","26","","","Oct.-Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Conventional memory controllers deliver relatively low performance in part because they often employ fixed, rigid access scheduling policies designed for average-case application behavior. As a result, they cannot learn and optimize the long-term performance impact of their scheduling decisions,and cannot adapt their scheduling policies to dynamic workload behavior.We propose a new, self-optimizing memory controller design that operates using the principles of reinforcement learning (RL)to overcome these limitations. Our RL-based memory controller observes the system state and estimates the long-term performance impact of each action it can take. In this way, the controller learns to optimize its scheduling policy on the fly to maximize long-term performance. Our results show that an RL-based memory controller improves the performance of a set of parallel applications run on a 4-core CMP by 19% on average (upto 33%), and it improves DRAM bandwidth utilization by 22%compared to a state-of-the-art controller.","1063-6897;10636897","POD:978-0-7695-3174-8","10.1109/ISCA.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4556714","Chip Multiprocessors;Machine Learning;Memory Controller;Memory Systems;Reinforcement Learning","Automatic control;Bandwidth;Control systems;Delay;Dynamic scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Machine learning;Moore's Law;Random access memory;State estimation","DRAM chips;integrated circuit design;learning (artificial intelligence);microcontrollers","access scheduling policies;high-performance chip multiprocessors;off-chip DRAM bandwidth;reinforcement learning;self-optimizing memory controllers","","38","12","49","","","21-25 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research on protein domain boundary prediction has been mainly based on widely known machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning based domain predictor namely, DomNet that can show a more accurate and stable predictive performance than the existing state-of-the-art models. The DomNet is trained using a novel compact domain profile, secondary structure, solvent accessibility information, and interdomain linker index to detect possible domain boundaries for a target sequence. The performance of the proposed model was compared to nine different machine learning models on the Benchmark_2 dataset in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation coefficient. The DomNet achieved the best performance with 71% accuracy for domain boundary identification in multidomains proteins. With the CASP7 benchmark dataset, it again demonstrated superior performance to contemporary domain boundary predictors such as DOMpro, DomPred, DomSSEA, DomCut, and DomainDiscovery.","1536-1241;15361241","","10.1109/TNB.2008.2000747","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4538003","Domain boundary prediction;domain linker index;machine learning;sequence encoding;sequence profile","Australia;Encoding;Evolution (biology);Helium;Information analysis;Machine learning;Predictive models;Proteins;Sequences;Solvents","biochemistry;biology computing;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;neural nets;proteins","CASP7 benchmark dataset;DomNet;correlation coefficient;enhanced general regression neural network;interdomain linker index;machine learning techniques;protein design;protein domain boundary prediction;protein evolution;protein function;protein structure;secondary structure;solvent accessibility information;target sequence","Amino Acid Sequence;Computer Simulation;Models, Chemical;Models, Molecular;Molecular Sequence Data;Protein Structure, Tertiary;Proteins;Regression Analysis;Sequence Analysis, Protein","17","","54","","","June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The new training algorithm is fast and simple. This is achieved by an over-complete wavelet transform that finds the optimal approximation of the support vectors. The presented derivation shows that the wavelet theory provides an upper bound on the distance between the decision function of the support vector machine and our classifier. The obtained classifier is fast, since a Haar wavelet approximation of the support vectors is used, enabling efficient integral image-based kernel evaluations. This provides a set of cascaded classifiers of increasing complexity for an early rejection of vectors easy to discriminate. This excellent runtime performance is achieved by using a hierarchical evaluation over the number of incorporated and additional over the approximation accuracy of the reduced set vectors. Here, this algorithm is applied to the problem of face detection, but it can also be used for other image-based classifications. The algorithm presented, provides a 530-fold speedup over the support vector machine, enabling face detection at more than 25 fps on a standard PC.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2008.2001393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664621","Cascaded evaluation;coarse-to-fine classifier;face detection;machine learning;over-complete wavelet transform (OCWT);reduced support vector machine (RVM)","Acceleration;Classification algorithms;Face detection;Filters;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Runtime;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Wavelet transforms","Haar transforms;face recognition;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;wavelet transforms","Haar wavelet approximation;face detection;image-based classifications;integral image-based kernel evaluations;runtime complexity;support vector machines;training algorithm","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","6","","21","","","Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On-demand access to computational resources enables fine-grained resource allocation for web-based applications, e.g., the possibility of provisioning for a minimum workload while allowing the rental of additional resources for unexpected workload changes. However, renting additional resources relies on the ability to quickly and accurately estimate the value of the resource. This paper introduces CARVE: a cognitive agent for resource value estimation. CARVE is a machine-learning based approach that learns to predict the change in system value of having more or less system resources. Using only low-level statistics and with no custom instrumentation of the operating system or middleware, CARVE is able to make informed decisions about the return on investment of physical memory when implemented and evaluated on a partitioned system running a multi-partition, multi-process distributed benchmark. We show that CARVE is competitive with static choices of computing resources over a variety of test workloads and also has the ability to outperform all static configurations.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3175-5","10.1109/ICAC.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550839","autonomic computing;autonomous agents;machine learning;resource allocation;supervised learning;utility computing;virtualization","Application software;Cloud computing;Computer industry;Cooling;Costs;Hardware;Investments;Resource management;Statistical distributions;Testing","Internet;cognitive systems;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;statistical analysis;utility programs","Web-based applications;cognitive agent;decision making;low-level statistics;machine learning;resource allocation;resource value estimation;utility computing","","10","","21","","","2-6 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their advantages stem from two facts: 1) tailored to normalized data, which are often the outputs from the data preprocessing step, and 2) directly designed with correlation metric, which shows to be generally better than Euclidean distance for classification purpose.

Traditionally, control skill analysis focuses on how to design a state-action map to provide appropriate actions according to the states. Therefore approaches such as dynamic programming and neural networks are employed to compute the appropriate actions for all the states. However, this results in time consuming computation, low robustness and no human control characteristics. Although human control skill is robust, it is subcognitive and difficult to be described by the human operators themselves. In this case, human control trajectory is proposed to record and analyze human control skill. Human control trajectory is just a sequence of the systempsilas states and corresponding human operatorpsilas control actions, sampled at a certain frequency. Taking the advantages of human control trajectories and computation, a new approach is proposed. That is analyzing the human operatorspsila control trajectories to find out the most important states which limit the control effect. And then compute the selected states to set up the local state-action map. After that, based on the computational results and the human control trajectories, synthesize the global state-action map to realize the control skill transformation process. In this paper, a dynamic simulator is used as an example to evaluate the effect of the proposed approach. The results show that this approach can reduce the total computational cost while improve the human operatorpsilas control skill effectively.","2161-8151;21618151","POD:978-1-4244-2502-0","10.1109/ICAL.2008.4636260","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636260","Dynamic Simulator;Human Control Skill;Human Control Trajectory;Machine Learning;State-Action Map","Computer networks;Control systems;Dynamic programming;Frequency;Humans;Intelligent robots;Neural networks;Process control;Robust control;Trajectory","control system analysis;dynamic programming;intelligent robots","control skill analysis;control skill transformation;cooperative environment;dynamic programming;dynamic simulator;human control computation;human control trajectories;intelligent robot;neural networks;state-action map","","1","","19","","","1-3 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results obtained using four object detectors for finding faces and three different hand poses, respectively, show that detectors trained with the proposed algorithm yield consistently higher detection rates than those based on their framework while using the same number of features.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359367","Face and gesture recognition;Feature evaluation and selection;Machine learning;Statistical","","feature extraction;object detection","boosting process;discriminative feature cooccurrence selection;feature extraction;object detection;sequential forward selection","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Discriminant Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","45","1","32","","","July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our work is motivated by the application of segmenting a lung nodule in a computed tomography (CT) scan of the human chest. The lack of a gold standard of truth is a critical problem in medical imaging. A variety of experts, both human and computer algorithms, are available that can mark which voxels are part of a nodule. The question is, how to combine these expert opinions to estimate the unknown ground truth. We present the Veritas algorithm that predicts the underlying label using the knowledge in the expert opinions even without the benefit of any labeled data for training.

The NGDC filaments catalogue and the SOHO/LASCO CMEs catalogue are processed to associate filaments with CMEs based on timing and location information. Automated systems are created to process and associate years of filaments and CME data, which are later arranged in numerical training vectors and fed to machine learning algorithms to extract the embedded knowledge and provide learning rules that can be used for the automated prediction of CMEs. Features representing the filament time, duration, type and extent are extracted from all the associated (A) and not-associated (NA) filaments and converted to a numerical format that is suitable for machine learning use. The machine learning system predicts if the filament is likely to initiate a CME. Intensive experiments are carried out to optimise the SVM.

In the processed-food industry where the external quality attributes of the product are inspected visually before the packaging line, machine vision systems often involve the extraction of a larger number of features than those actually needed to ensure proper quality control. This work experiments with several feature selection techniques in order to reduce the number of attributes analyzed by a real-time vision-based food inspection system. Four filter-based and wrapper-based feature selectors are evaluated on seeded buns and tortillas datasets. Experimental results show that consistency-based and the RELIEF subset evaluation techniques perform the best for all the considered datasets in terms of accuracy.

In this paper, we propose an alternative estimation method of the parameters on BNs. The method uses a principle, with roots in statistical thermal physics, of minimizing free energy. We propose an explicit model of the temperature, which should be properly estimated. We designate the model ""data temperature"".
