Many documents of considered categories make it numerous. Therefore, the dimension of feature vector is very high that makes it consumes a lot of time and memory to process. Moreover, it is a cause of the small sample size problem when the number of available training documents is far smaller than the dimension of these feature vectors. This paper proposes the alternative technique of dimensionality reduction for the feature vector in two-dimensional manner by previously transforming the feature vector to the feature matrix and then using Two-Dimensional Principal Component Analysis (2DPCA) for reducing the dimension of this feature matrix. Based on 2DPCA, the original weighted term matrix is not necessary to store in the memory anymore because the scatter matrix of 2DPCA can be computed incrementally. The small reduction in matrix form impacts to the plenty of dimensionality reduction in vector form. From the experimental results on well-known dataset, the proposed method not only significantly reduce the dimensionality but also achieve the higher accuracy rate than the original feature space.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2193-8; POD:978-1-4673-2192-1","10.1109/ICSPCC.2012.6335622","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335622","Document classification;Feature extraction;Matricization","Accuracy;Covariance matrix;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Vectors","classification;feature extraction;matrix algebra;principal component analysis;text analysis","dimensionality reduction;document classification;feature matrix;feature space;feature vector;text classification;two dimensional principal component analysis","","0","","14","","","12-15 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These cycle-based segments are input to the feature extraction process. We apply Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for classification and compare the results to previous ones obtained using segments of a fixed time-length.

One problem with this algorithm is the choice of k value. Different k values can have a large impact on the predictive accuracy of the algorithm, and picking a good value is generally unintuitive by looking at the data set. Cross-validation over multiple folds is often used to find the best value for k in kNN based on prediction results. In this paper, we propose automatic selection of neighboring instances as defined by a dynamic local region unique to each instance, as opposed to the traditional approach of considering the manually specified k nearest neighbors. Removing the need to select an appropriate k value removes the cross-validation step, which improves the computational performance of the algorithm. Classification accuracy achieved by this approach is only slightly lower than the results of using kNN with an optimally selected k value.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2284-3; POD:978-1-4673-2282-9; USB:978-1-4673-2283-6","10.1109/IRI.2012.6302995","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6302995","","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Equations;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Testing;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","dynamic selection;instance based learning;k nearest neighbors;kNN;lazy learning algorithm;machine learning applications","","0","","29","","","8-10 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This specific type of machine learning approach uses examples only from a single class to derive a decision boundary - hence its is often referred to as learning in the absence of counterexamples. Combining several one-class classifiers is a promising research direction, as it often results in a more precise classification than when using just a single model. Most one-class classifiers base their decision on a distance from an object to the decision boundary, canonically expressed in the Euclidean measure. When combining such predictors it is necessary to map the distance into probability, therefore the measure used has a crucial impact on the classifier fusion. This paper proposes alternative distance measures for one-class classification, which are evaluated through experimental investigations.","","Electronic:978-83-60810-48-4; POD:978-1-4673-0708-6; USB:978-83-60810-51-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354440","combined classifier;distance measures;multiple classifier systems;one-class classification;one-class support vector machine","Accuracy;Computer science;Euclidean distance;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Support vector machines","computational geometry;distance measurement;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sensor fusion;support vector machines","Euclidean measure;classifier fusion;decision boundary;distance measures;machine learning approach;multiple classifier system;one-class classifiers;one-class support vector machine","","5","","21","","","9-12 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way (of many) to collect those reports is through crowdsourcing. By taking advantage of the army of people connected to the internet via both wired and wireless technologies, we can easily gather information that would help a citizen make an informed decision regarding his or her health and welfare (e.g., shelter-in-place vs. flight). The widespread use of smartphones allows people to post geolocated reports and pictures with ease. Disaster management teams would likewise benefit from the input of more observers. On the other hand, the trustworthiness of these reports may be uncertain. For instance, a terrorist group might use crowdsourcing to redirect the community's emergency responses to the wrong place.

However, in most machine learning applications, it is not possible to request for labels of arbitrary examples constructed by an algorithm. Instead, the dominant query paradigm in applied machine learning, called active learning, is one where the algorithm may query for labels, but only on points in a given (polynomial-sized) unlabeled sample, drawn from some underlying distribution D. In this work, we bring this well-studied model to the domain of testing. We develop both general results for this active testing model as well as efficient testing algorithms for several important properties for learning, demonstrating that testing can still yield substantial benefits in this restricted setting. For example, we show that testing unions of d intervals can be done with O(1) label requests in our setting, whereas it is known to √ require Ω(d) labeled examples for learning (and Ω(√d) for passive testing [22] where the algorithm must pay for every example drawn from D). In fact, our results for testing unions of intervals also yield improvements on prior work in both the classic query model (where any point in the domain can be queried) and the passive testing model as well. For the problem of testing linear separators in Rn over the Gaussian distribution, we show that both active and passive testing can be done with O(√n) queries, substantially less than the Ω(n) needed for learning, with near-matching lower bounds. We also present a general combination result in this model for building testable properties out of others, which we then use to provide testers for a number of assumptions used in semi-supervised learning. In addition to the above results, we also develop a general notion of the testing dimension of a given property with respect to a given distribution, that we show characteriz- s (up to constant factors) the intrinsic number of label requests needed to test that property. We develop such notions for both the active and passive testing models. We then use these dimensions to prove a number of lower bounds, including for linear separators and the class of dictator functions.","0272-5428;02725428","Electronic:978-0-7695-4874-6; POD:978-1-4673-4383-1","10.1109/FOCS.2012.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375278","Active learning;Boolean functions;Linear threshold functions;Property testing;Unions of intervals","Algorithm design and analysis;Gaussian distribution;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Noise;Sensitivity;Testing","Boolean functions;Gaussian distribution;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing","Boolean functions;Gaussian distribution;active learning;active property testing;dictator functions;dominant query paradigm;linear separator testing problem;machine learning applications;passive testing;passive testing models;polynomial-sized unlabeled sample;query model;semi-supervised learning","","3","","31","","","20-23 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This initial dimensionality reduction step is followed by distance metric learning for the construction of an informative distance matrix, which is then embedded in a manifold learning approach to increase the discriminative power of the random measurements in a lower-dimensional space.

Defining sub-populations or strata to random samples from is theoretically sound, but the definition of sub-populations is quite expensive. The paper presents a customer sampling technique based on quota. The domains for the quota are defined by machine learning algorithms and the quota themselves are based on realistic data. Sampling is done by an optimization algorithm, which eliminates the common `human error'-factor in quota sampling. The approach is a cost efficient and convenient way of sampling that is able to balance the representativeness of the electricity consumption patterns for the population against sampling accuracy.

This setting is known as multipartite ranking in the literature. Our approach is based on the idea of using the (discrete) Choquet integral as an underlying model for representing ranking functions. Being an established aggregation function in fields such as multiple criteria decision making and information fusion, the Choquet integral offers a number of interesting properties that make it attractive from a machine learning perspective, too. The learning problem itself comes down to properly specifying the fuzzy measure on which the Choquet integral is defined.

Prompting technologies have gained popularity over the last decade and have the potential to assist these individuals with IADLs in order to live independently. Although prompting techniques are routinely used by caregivers and health care providers to aid individuals with cognitive impairment in maintaining their independence with everyday activities, there is no clear consensus or gold standard regarding prompt content, method of instruction, timing of delivery, or interface of prompt delivery in the gerontology or technology literatures. In this paper, we demonstrate how cognitive rehabilitation principles can inform and advance the development of more effective assistive prompting technologies that could be employed in smart environments. We first describe cognitive rehabilitation theory (CRT) and show how it provides a useful theoretical foundation for guiding the development of assistive technologies for IADL completion. We then use the CRT framework to critically review existing smart prompting technologies to answer questions that will be integral to advancing development of effective smart prompting technologies.

Feature construction is particularly important for classifier inducers that cannot transform their input space intrinsically. This paper proposes GPMFC, a multiple-feature construction system for classification problems using genetic programming (GP). This paper takes a nonwrapper approach by introducing a filter-based measure of goodness for constructed features. The constructed, high-level features are functions of original input features. These functions are evolved by GP using an entropy-based fitness function that maximizes the purity of class intervals. A decomposable objective function is proposed so that the system is able to construct multiple high-level features for each problem. The constructed features are used to transform the original input space to a new space with better separability. Extensive experiments are conducted on a number of benchmark problems and symbolic learning classifiers. The results show that, in most cases, the new approach is highly effective in increasing the classification performance in rule-based and decision tree classifiers. The constructed features help improve the learning performance of symbolic learners. The constructed features, however, may lack intelligibility.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2011.2166158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151112","Classification;decision trees;feature construction;genetic programming (GP);rule-based systems","Biological cells;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Genetic programming;Machine learning algorithms;Numerical models;Transforms","benchmark testing;decision trees;entropy;feature extraction;filters;genetic algorithms;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","GP;GPMFC;benchmark problems;class intervals;classification problems;classifier inducers;decision tree classifiers;decomposable objective function;entropy-based fitness function;filter approach;filter-based measurement;genetic programming;learning performance;multiple high-level features;multiple-feature construction system;nonwrapper approach;rule-based classifiers;symbolic learning classifiers","","28","","87","","20120210","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our primary objective is to demonstrate and statistically justify that forecasting models that utilize temporal information of the historical readings of ICP and related parameters are superior, in terms of performance, compared with models that do not make use of temporal information. Material & Method. 82 traumatic brain injuries patients, who were admitted between 2002 to 2007 and were continuously monitored on ICP for more than 24 hours, are selected for the study. Together with ICP, MAP and PbtO<sub>2</sub> were also monitored, and PRx was calculated as a moving correlation between ICP and MAP. The development trends of ICP and the related parameters are measured by first segmenting the time-series data into multiple periodic windows. The development trend of each periodic window is then discretized into three classes - elevate, stay or reduce - based on the concept of “trend line”. A systematic framework is developed to compare the forecast performance between the temporal and non-temporal models. Findings. Experimental results demonstrate that the utilization of temporal information directly leads to a considerable boost in trend forecasting performance (on average 20% relative performance gain was achieved). Moreover, the performance gain is confirmed to be statistically significant (p-value <; 0.0001) based on a paired t-test.","1094-687X;1094687X","Electronic:978-1-4577-1787-1; POD:978-1-4244-4119-8; USB:978-1-4244-4120-4","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346826","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346826","","Forecasting;Iterative closest point algorithm;Machine learning algorithms;Market research;Monitoring;Predictive models;Vectors","biomedical measurement;blood vessels;brain;forecasting theory;injuries;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pressure measurement;statistical analysis;time series","ICP;MAP;PbtO<sub>2</sub>;brain tissue oxygenation;historical readings;intracranial pressure development trend forecasting model;mean arterial pressure;moving correlation;multiple periodic windows;nontemporal models;paired t-test;performance gain;pressure reactivity index;statistics;temporal information utilization;time-series data segmentation;traumatic brain injured patients","Algorithms;Brain Injuries;Humans;Intracranial Pressure;Monitoring, Physiologic;Time Factors","0","","25","","","Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Repeated Cross-Validation (RCV) is used to try to further improve the accuracy of our performance estimates, including compensating for outliers. Typically a Machine Learning researcher will the compare a new target algorithm against a wide range of competing algorithms on a wide range of standard datasets. The combination of many training folds, many CV repetitions, many algorithms and parameterizations, and many training sets, adds up to a very large number of data points to compare, and a massive multiple testing problem quadratic in the number of individual test combinations. Research in Machine Learning sometimes involves basic significance testing, or provides confidence intervals, but seldom addresses the multiple testing problem whereby the assumption of p<;.05 significance means that we expect a spurious ""significant"" result for 1 in 20 of our many test pairs.

Nevertheless, the design of a SMR-based BCI system that provides every user with a reliable BCI control from the first session, i.e., without extensive training, is still a big challenge. Considerable advances in this direction have been made by the machine learning co-adaptive calibration approach, which combines online adaptation techniques with subject learning in order to offer the user a feedback from the beginning of the experiment. Recently, based on offline analyses, we proposed the novel Common Spatial Patterns Patches (CSPP) technique as a good candidate to improve the co-adaptive calibration. CSPP is an ensemble of localized spatial filters, each of them optimized on subject-specific data by CSP analysis. Here, the evaluation of CSPP in online operation is presented for the first time. Results on three BCI-naive participants show indeed promising results. All three users reach the threshold criterion of 70% accuracy within one session, even one candidate for whom the weak SMR at rest predicted deficient BCI control.

As usual, simplicity and high performance are two sides of a same coin. Our aim is to explore an easy-to-use classifier without losing its effectiveness. On this account, a single attribute based classification (SAC) algorithm is proposed. SAC first splits the original data set into multi one-dimensional data sets. After that, it creates a base classifier, e.g. C4.5, for each one-dimensional data, and then selects all classifiers having the highest accuracy. At last, SAC uses these selected classifiers to make prediction and the most frequent label is assigned to the new instance. Results of classification accuracy on 16 data sets from UCI machine learning repository indicate that the proposed method performs better in comparison with classical OneR algorithm. Experiments on high-dimensional data are also conducted to evaluate the proposed method, which demonstrates its scalability.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4749-7; POD:978-1-4673-2164-8","10.1109/HPCC.2012.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332232","","Accuracy;Indexes;Machine learning algorithms;Niobium;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","SAC algorithm;UCI machine learning repository;classification accuracy;classifier;data mining;high-dimensional data;one-dimensional data sets;single attribute-based classification algorithm","","0","","18","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal is to discover and capture the intrinsic nature of the data by proposing some approaches that combine the major advantages of generative models namely finite mixtures and discriminative techniques namely support vector machines (SVMs). Indeed, SVMs often rely on classic kernels which are not generally meaningful for proportional data. One serious limitation of these kernels is that they do not take into account the nature of data to classify and choosing a suitable kernel continues to be a formidable challenge for data mining and machine learning researchers. Our approach builds on selecting accurate kernels generated from finite mixtures of Dirichlet, generalized Dirichlet and Beta-Liouville distributions which chief advantage is their flexibility and explanatory capabilities in the case of heterogenous proportional data.

One of the main findings is that the cluster purity and the normalized mutual information of the clusters are not very high which suggests that the domains might not necessarily be natural clusters. The performance of these cluster-specific classifiers is better than that of: (a) a single classifier trained on data from all the domains, and (b) a set of classifiers trained separately for each of the training domains.

The core idea is to enlarge the distance between different classes under the conceptual framework of LSR. First, a technique called ε-dragging is introduced to force the regression targets of different classes moving along opposite directions such that the distances between classes can be enlarged. Then, the ε-draggings are integrated into the LSR model for multiclass classification. Our learning framework, referred to as discriminative LSR, has a compact model form, where there is no need to train two-class machines that are independent of each other. With its compact form, this model can be naturally extended for feature selection. This goal is achieved in terms of <i>L</i><sub>2,1</sub> norm of matrix, generating a sparse learning model for feature selection. The model for multiclass classification and its extension for feature selection are finally solved elegantly and efficiently. Experimental evaluation over a range of benchmark datasets indicates the validity of our method.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2212721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298965","Feature selection;least squares regression;multiclass classification;sparse learning","Indexes;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Training;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;matrix algebra;pattern classification;regression analysis","ε-dragging;LSR conceptual framework;discriminative LSR;discriminative least squares regression;feature selection;learning framework;matrix L<sub>2-1</sub> norm;multiclass classification;regression targets;sparse learning model","","46","","60","","20120911","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Ad hoc Bregman divergences can be designed to get a higher estimation accuracy for the posterior probability values that are most critical for a particular cost-sensitive classification scenario. Moreover, some sequences of Bregman loss functions can be constructed in such a way that their minimization guarantees, asymptotically, minimum number of errors in nonseparable cases, and maximum margin classifiers in separable problems.

These systems usually follow the classical supervised learning paradigm, in which training data from different patients are employed to construct a classifier that is patient-independent. In this paper, we show how by sharing information from different patients, it is possible to increase accuracy for targeting the Subthalamic Nucleus. We do this in the context of multi-task learning, where different but related tasks are used simultaneously to leverage the performance of a learning system.

The analysis of tractographies has drawn attention from the machine learning and pattern recognition communities providing novel challenges such as finding an appropriate representation space for the data. Many of the current learning algorithms require the input to be from a vectorial space. This requirement contrasts with the intrinsic nature of the tractography because its basic elements, called streamlines or tracks, have different lengths and different number of points and for this reason they cannot be directly represented in a common vectorial space. In this work we propose the adoption of the dissimilarity representation which is an Euclidean embedding technique defined by selecting a set of streamlines called prototypes and then mapping any new streamline to the vector of distances from prototypes. We investigate the degree of approximation of this projection under different prototype selection policies and prototype set sizes in order to characterise its use on tractography data. Additionally we propose the use of a scalable approximation of the most effective prototype selection policy that provides fast and accurate dissimilarity approximations of complete tractographies.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4765-7; POD:978-1-4673-2182-2","10.1109/PRNI.2012.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295934","Euclidean embedding;dMRI;dissimilarity representation;prototype selection;tractography","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Correlation;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Prototypes;Standards","approximation theory;biomedical MRI;computational geometry;image reconstruction;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","Euclidean embedding technique;axon 3D pathway reconstruction;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data;dissimilarity projection approximation;dissimilarity representation;learning algorithms;machine learning communities;pattern recognition communities;prototype selection policies;prototype set sizes;streamlines;tracks;tractography analysis;vectorial space","","3","","14","","","2-4 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper concerns the relationships between covering-based rough sets and matroid. Firstly, we establish the free matroidal structure of covering-based rough sets. Any subset of a universe can generate a free matroid, therefore any covering of a universe can be characterized by a family of free matroids. On the other hand, a family of free matroids can be used to generate a covering. Secondly, reducible element is to remove the redundant element in covering-based rough sets, reducible matroid is to remove redundant matroid in a family of matroids. We mainly research the relationship between reducible element and the reducible matroid in the family of free matroids induced by covering. Actually they are equivalent, the reducible element of a covering is always consistent with the reducible matroid induced by the covering. These results enrich covering-based rough set theory and matroid theory.","","Electronic:978-89-88678-55-8; POD:978-1-4577-0472-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6316717","Free matroid;Matroids;Reducible element;Reducible matroid;Rough sets","Approximation methods;Educational institutions;Machine learning;Rough sets","matrix algebra;rough set theory","abstract graph generation;abstract matrix generation;computer science;covering-based rough sets;free matroidal structure;matroid theory;mechanical engineering;reducible matroid;rough set theory","","0","","18","","","Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main idea of this paper intends to embed the information of gene networks into a new SVM learning framework. Based on a new regularization, we propose a novel method, Network Kernel SVM (NK-SVM), for binary classification problem and gene sets selection. By constructing some special kernel matrixes from the prior information of gene network, the new NK-SVM method makes the genes in the same set to be selected (or eliminated) together.

Such components employ monitoring and machine learning techniques to capture human behaviours and process them to extract adaptation rules (or user preferences). However, learning preferences from observations of behaviour introduces challenges that are not so compounded in other machine learning problem domains. One key issue is preparational behaviours (or pre-actions) which current preference learning solutions can struggle to handle. This paper uses pre-actions as an example discussion point and raises the question of whether preference learning solutions should take advantage of temporal data from real-world environments to improve performance.

This function must differ between robots because of their different kinematics, between users because of their different preferences, and even between tasks that the users perform with the robot. Our work enables users to customize this retargetting function, and achieve any of these required differences. In our approach, the robot starts with an initial function. As the user teleoperates the robot, he can pause and provide example correspondences, which instantly update the retargetting function. We select the algorithm underlying these updates by formulating the problem as an instance of online function approximation. The problem's requirements, as well as the semantics and constraints of motion retargetting, lead to an extension of Online Learning with Kernel Machines in which the width of the kernel can vary. Our central hypothesis is that this method enables users to train retargetting functions to good outcomes. We validate this hypothesis in a user study, which also reveals the importance of providing users with tools to verify their examples: much like an actor needs a mirror to verify his pose, a user needs to verify his input before providing an example.

In this position paper we address the problem of visualizing dynamic processes especially in self-learning systems. We take an existing self-learning system from the field of computer vision as an example from which we derive questions of general interest such as possible options to visualize the flow of information in a dynamic learning system or the visualization of symbolic data.

In this paper we present an enhancement approach for improving the performance of decision tree using Support Vector Machine (SVM) when dealing with unbalanced data. The proposed approach modifies the available training data according to the predictions of SVM and this modified training data is then used to train decision tree. As the dataset at hand i.e. COIL data is highly unbalanced with 94:6 class distribution ratios, we also employed various standard sampling techniques for extensive analysis. Based on sensitivity measure, it is observed that the proposed approach enhanced the efficiency of decision tree exceptionally well. Other intelligent methods can be tested in place of DT.","pending","Electronic:978-1-4673-2430-4; POD:978-1-4673-2428-1","10.1109/ICDIM.2012.6360115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6360115","CoIL Dataset;Decision Tree;Support Vector Machine;Unbalanced Data","Accuracy;Decision trees;Machine learning;Sensitivity;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","data analysis;decision trees;pattern classification;sampling methods;support vector machines","COIL data;SVM prediction;class distribution ratio;computational intelligence technique;decision tree performance enhancement;extensive analysis;high dimensional data;sampling technique;sensitivity measure;statistical technique;support vector machine;unbalanced data","","0","","22","","","22-24 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Internet users are growing day by day and becoming a popular source for spreading the information through news/blogs etc. To monitor this information, a lot of quality work has been done in that perspective. Related to news monitoring, our proposed unsupervised machine learning approach will fetch the entities and relationships from the news document itself and through comparison with other related news documents, it will form a cluster. We propose, in this paper, a dynamic model for entity extraction and relationship in order to monitor the news reported in the news articles.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-4450-0; Electronic:978-1-4673-4451-7; POD:978-1-4673-4452-4","10.1109/ICET.2012.6375469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375469","Entity extraction;document grouping;relationship extraction;unsupervised classification","Assembly;Context;Data mining;Machine learning;Manuals;Monitoring;Tagging","Web sites;data structures;document handling;information retrieval;unsupervised learning","blogs;dynamic entity extraction;dynamic relationship extraction;information extraction technique;information retrieval technique;news articles;news documents;news monitoring;structured data technique;unstructured data technique;unsupervised machine learning","","0","","10","","","8-9 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
