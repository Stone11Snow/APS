Proposed steganalysis scheme contains two steps: 1) search a subset of features (among set of 22510 features) with the most promising performances, and 2) build an cognitive ensemble classifier for efficient steganalysis. In the first step we used Binary Coded Genetic Algorithm (BCGA) coupled with Extreme Learning machine to collect few subset of features with promising performances and corresponding ELM models. In the second step we used another BCGA for searching the best combination of few ELM models computed in the first step.

In this research we choose magnetic resonance images (MRI) of hippocampus area taken from ADHD-200 data base. Each MRI scan is processed by computing population averages and applying region of interest mask. The set of hippocampus features is then processed by proposed BCGA-ELM approach. In BCGA-ELM each hippocampus feature represents as one bit value. “1” means that the feature is chosen for learning, “0” means the feature is skipped. BCGA-ELM performs a search for set of features with the most promising performances. The chosen features is then used as input for Meta - Cognitive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (McFIS) learning approach.

An efficient probabilistic forecasting method for the construction of prediction intervals (PIs) using bootstrap and kernel-based extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed. To overcome the drawbacks of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in predicting mutational displacement points with time lags, this paper proposes an ANNs switched prediction scheme to construct PIs with a three-stage formulation. In the first stage, K-means clustering is applied to divide the whole training dataset into two sub-training sets: the stationary points and the mutational points. In the second stage, a weighted ELM classifier is applied to construct the switched rules. In the third stage, bootstrap- and kernel-based ELMs are applied to construct candidate PIs for each sub-training set. The final PIs are constructed by switching between these two candidate PIs. The effectiveness of the proposed ANNs switched prediction method has been validated through comprehensive tests using three real-world landslide datasets from the Three Gorges region of China.","0018-9529;00189529","","10.1109/TR.2016.2570540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500105","Extreme learning machine (ELM);landslide displacement prediction;prediction intervals (PIs);switched prediction","Artificial neural networks;Kernel;Switches;Terrain factors;Training;Uncertainty","bootstrapping;geomorphology;neural nets;probability","ANN switched prediction scheme;China;K-means clustering;Three Gorges region;artificial neural networks;bootstrap;kernel-based extreme learning machine;landslide displacement;landslide early warning system;prediction intervals;probabilistic forecasting method;stationary points;switched neural networks;three real-world landslide datasets;three-stage formulation","","","","","","20160627","Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the proposed method, ARPSO considers both the convergence accuracy on the validation data and the diversity of the ensemble system. To effectively weigh the diversity of the ensemble system, a new diversity based on the Euclidean distance among the candidate ELMs is defined in this study.

In order to overcome the shortness of ELMs, we try to maintain the geometric structure of the samples distribution in the initial setting of ELM parameters by starting with an auto-encoder ELM, a sufficient condition for such kind auto-encoder ELM to keep the equivalence of topological homology before and after nonlinear mapping is proved by us. For an auto-encoder, in order to do feature abstraction and find the exact manifold in which samples are located, the number of inner layers nodes should be small enough. For this purpose, we prove that the whole samples set can be at least replaced by a small subset which located on the boundary of distribution region.

These shortages have had a very detrimental effect on the overall economic growth of the country. As total Power losses equals transmission power losses plus distribution power losses. The reasons cited for such high losses are; lack of adequate T & D capacity, too many transformation stages, improper load distribution and extensive rural electrification etc. The sources of transmission power losses may be directly driven by network investment or by network operation. Distribution power losses arise from several areas including theft, un-billed accounts, and estimated customer accounts, errors due to the approximation of consumption by un-metered supplies and metering errors Electricity theft can be in the form of fraud (meter tampering), stealing (illegal connections), billing irregularities, and unpaid bills. Estimates of the extent of electricity theft in a sample of 102 countries are undertaken. The evidence shows that theft is increasing in most regions of the world. Electricity consumer dishonesty is a problem faced by all power utilities. Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. Data mining has become increasingly common in both the public and private sectors. This paper presents a new approach towards Distribution Power Loss analysis for electric utilities using a novel intelligence-based technique like Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), an online sequential learning algorithm for single hidden layer feed forward networks (SLFNs) with additive or radial basis function (RBF) hidden nodes in a unified framework. OS-ELM & Support Vector Machine (SVM). The main motivation of this study is to assist Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam LTD (GUVNL), GUJARAT, INDIA to reduce its Distribution Power Loss due to electricity theft. This approach provides a method of data mining and involves feature extraction from historical - ustomer consumption data. This model preselects suspected customers to be inspected onsite for fraud based on abnormal consumption behavior. The proposed approach uses customer load profile information to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with Distribution Power Loss activities. The approach uses customer load profile information to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with Power Loss activities. Simulation results prove the proposed method is more effective compared to the current actions taken by GUVNL in order to reduce Power Loss activities.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1951-2; POD:978-1-4799-1952-9","10.1109/PSC.2015.7101683","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7101683","Electricity theft;Extreme learning machine (ELM);Intelligent systems;Online Sequential Extreme learning machine (OSELM);Support vector machine","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Neurons;Propagation losses;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","data mining;electricity supply industry;power distribution;power system management;power system measurement;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","GUVNL;Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam LTD;India;OS-ELM;RBF;SLFN;SVM;T & D capacity;billing irregularities;customer consumption data;customer load profile;data mining;distribution power losses;economic growth;electricity consumer dishonesty;electricity consumption;electricity theft detection techniques;extreme learning machine;feature extraction;illegal connections;intelligence-based technique;load distribution;meter tampering;metered power consumer;online sequential learning algorithm;power utilities;radial basis function;rural electrification;single hidden layer feed forward networks;support vector machine;transmission power losses;unpaid bills","","0","","16","","","10-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given a UAV image acquired over a palm farm, first we extract a set of keypoints using the Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Then, we analyze these keypoints with an extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier a priori trained on a set of palm and no-palm keypoints. As output, the ELM classifier will mark each detected palm tree by several keypoints. Then, in order to capture the shape of each tree, we propose to merge these keypoints with an active contour method based on level sets (LSs). Finally, we further analyze the texture of the regions obtained by LS with local binary patterns (LBPs) to distinguish palm trees from other vegetations.

Dong","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Abstract—The fluctuation and uncertainty of wind power generation bring severe challenges to secure and economic operation of power systems. Because wind power forecasting error is unavoidable, probabilistic forecasting becomes critical to accurately quantifying the uncertainty involved in traditional point forecasts of wind power and to providing meaningful information to conduct risk management in power system operation. This paper proposes a novel direct quantile regression (DQR) approach to efficiently generate nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation combining extreme learning machine (ELM) and quantile regression. Quantiles with different proportions can be directly produced via an innovatively formulated linear programming optimization model, without dependency on point forecasts. Multi-step probabilistic forecasting of 10-min wind power is newly carried out based on real wind farm data from Bornholm Island in Denmark. The superiority of the proposed approach is verified through comparisons with other well-established benchmarks. The proposed approach forms a new artificial neural network-based nonparametric forecasting framework for wind power with high efficiency, reliability, and flexibility, which can be beneficial to various decision-making activities in power systems.","0885-8950;08858950","","10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2625101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7733064","Wind power;extreme learning machine;linear programming;probabilistic forecasting;quantile regression;uncertainty","Forecasting;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Reliability;Uncertainty;Wind forecasting;Wind power generation","","","","","","","","20161103","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The techniques combine electrostatic sensors with capacitance sensors and incorporates a data fusion technique based on an adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN), and gradient descent learning algorithm and genetic learning algorithm are used for training of the network parameters. The flow regime is first identified by performing an extreme learning machine on the electrostatic fluctuation signals, thus making the concentration measurement less affected by variations in the flow regimes.

Human gait analysis can be performed by using a treadmill and two aligned web cameras, positioned one on each side of the treadmill. In this system, passive marks are positioned on person's joints and various angles of the gait are recorded by the cameras at different speeds of the treadmill. The treadmill's speed is appropriated for each person clinical case. This system is a substantial evolution from [1] at a much lower cost than [2] and [3]. This research project aims to create software capable of generating joint trajectory references of healthy people gaits, considering height, weight, age and test speed. These trajectories will be used as reference to compare with the data of a person with an abnormal gait. From this comparison a classification of the severity of the pathology will be obtained. The developed software uses an artificial neural network, based on 97 samples from 20 walking people with healthy gaits, collected on treadmill's tests. 70% of the samples were used for training, 5% for validation and 25% for testing. The two best neural networks for the knee joints are constituted by 10 or 12 neurons in the hidden layer, showing regression values higher than 97%. They have four inputs (height, weight, age and test speed) and the output is the reference knee joint trajectory. In this project it is also used the extreme learning machine, as an alternative computational intelligence approach of the neural network. With this software physiotherapists can make gait pattern comparisons taking into account the specific characteristics of each person, instead of comparisons with the standard gait patterns of the literature that does not differentiate for different characteristics. The system was tested analyzing the gait of 7 persons who were subjected to ligamentoplasty (surgical reconstruction) about two years ago, after suffering a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee. Collected data were compared with the traj- ctory references generated by the software for each person taking into account their physical characteristics. The results show that this software makes it possible to analyze and quantify the severity of gait pathologies, which is a significant improvement to the present subjective analysis practice.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8269-1; POD:978-1-4799-8270-7","10.1109/ENBENG.2015.7088805","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7088805","Artificial Neural Network;Extreme Learning Machine;Human Gait Analysis","Artificial neural networks;Cameras;Joints;Knee;Pathology;Software;Trajectory","biomedical measurement;biomedical optical imaging;bone;cameras;data analysis;gait analysis;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;neural nets;patient care;software engineering;training","ANN software age input;ANN software height input;ANN software output;ANN software system test;ANN software test speed input;ANN software weight input;ANN software-assisted gait pathology analysis;ANN software-generated trajectory reference;ANN software-quantified gait pathology;ANN-based software;abnormal gait analysis;age-based joint trajectory reference;aligned web cameras;alternative computational intelligence approach;anterior cruciate ligament rupture;artificial neural network-based software;camera-recorded gait angle;clinical case-dependent treadmill speed;collected data-trajectory reference comparison;extreme learning machine;gait angle-positioned passive marks;gait pathology severity analysis;gait pathology severity quantification;healthy people gaits;height-based joint trajectory reference;hidden layer neurons;human gait analysis software;human gait classification software;joint trajectory reference generation;joint-positioned passive marks;knee anterior cruciate ligament;knee joint neural networks;ligamentoplasty patient gait analysis;literature-provided standard gait patterns;neural network computational intelligence approach;passive mark position;pathology severity classification;physiotherapist-analyzed patient gait patterns;reference knee joint trajectory;regression values;software system-generated trajectory reference;software-assisted gait pattern comparison;subjective gait pathology analysis practice;substantial evolution;surgical reconstruction patient gait analysis;test speed-based joint trajectory reference;trajectory-based patient data comparison;treadmill speed-dependent gait angle;treadmill test-collected gait data;treadmill-based human gait analysis;walking people healthy gaits;web camera-based human gait analysis;weight-based joint trajectory reference","","0","","","","","26-28 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The N-ELM consists of a set of ELMs as the nodes of the learning network, which forms a “generalized” structure with fault detection and RUL forecasting functions. By exploiting the advantages of ELM superb efficiency in regression, the error statistics based robust AdaBoost.RT based ELM framework (RAE-ELM) with self-adaptive threshold mechanism is applied to improve the accuracy of RUL predication.

Classification of EEG signals is an important task in BCI applications. This paper investigates two common methods of feature extraction on EEG signals, autoregressive (AR) model and approximate entropy. AR coefficients of each segment of each channel are calculated by AR model and entropies of each channel are also calculated by approximate entropy.

Therefore, how to mine matching patterns between services in relevant domains and compositions becomes crucial to service recommendation for composition. Existing methods usually overlook domain relevance and domain-specific matching patterns, which restrict the quality of recommendations. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to offer domain-aware service recommendation. First, a K Nearest Neighbor variant (vKNN) based on topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is introduced to cluster services into semantically coherent domains. On top of service domain clustering results by vKNN, a probabilistic matching model Domain Router (DR) based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is developed for decomposing a requirement to relevant domains. Finally, a comprehensive Domain Topic Matching (DTM) model is built to mine relevant domain-specific matching patterns to facilitate service recommendation. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset show that DTM not only gains significant improvement at precision rate but also enhances the diversity of results.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5054-6; POD:978-1-4799-5055-3","10.1109/ICWS.2014.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928929","Domain-aware Service Clustering;Domain-specific matching pattern;Extreme Learning Machine;LDA topic model;Service recommendation","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Feature extraction;Pattern matching;Predictive models;Training;Vectors","Web services;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;probability","DTM model;ELM;K-nearest neighbor variant;LDA;domain topic matching model;domain-aware service recommendation;domain-specific matching patterns;extreme learning machine;latent dirichlet allocation;probabilistic matching model domain router;service composition;service domain clustering;vKNN","","0","","17","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, for some input and output variables of these prediction models, there may exist a lot of uncertainties coming from themselves, the measurement error, the rough representation, and so on. In such cases, constructing a prediction interval (PI) for the output of the corresponding prediction model is very necessary. In this paper, two twin extreme learning machine (TELM) models for constructing PIs are proposed. First, we propose a regularized asymmetric least squares extreme learning machine (RALS-ELM) method, in which different weights of its squared error loss function are set according to whether the error of the model output is positive or negative in order that the above error can be differentiated in the parameter learning process, and Tikhonov regularization is introduced to reduce overfitting. Then, we propose an asymmetric Bayesian extreme learning machine (AB-ELM) method based on the Bayesian framework with the asymmetric Gaussian distribution (AB-ELM), in which the weights of its likelihood function are determined as the same method in RALS-ELM, and the type II maximum likelihood algorithm is derived to learn the parameters of AB-ELM. Based on RALS-ELM and AB-ELM, we use a pair of weights following the reciprocal relationship to obtain two nonparallel regressors, including a lower-bound regressor and an upper-bound regressor, respectively, which can be used for calculating the PIs. Finally, some discussions are given, about how to adjust the weights adaptively to meet the desired PI, how to use the proposed TELMs for nonlinear quantile regression, and so on. Results of numerical comparison on data from one synthetic regression problem, three University of California Irvine benchmark regression problems, and two actual industrial regression p- oblems show the effectiveness of the proposed models.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2362555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6963487","Asymmetric loss function;Bayesian regression;extreme learning machine (ELM);prediction interval (PI);twin support vector regression (TSVR);twin support vector regression (TSVR).","Bayes methods;Gaussian distribution;Predictive models;Steel;Temperature measurement;Uncertainty;Vectors","Bayes methods;Gaussian distribution;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;maximum likelihood estimation;regression analysis","AB-ELM;RALS-ELM;Tikhonov regularization;asymmetric Bayesian extreme learning machine;asymmetric Gaussian distribution;likelihood function weights;nonlinear quantile regression;nonparallel regressors;overfitting reduction;parameter learning process;prediction interval;regularized asymmetric least squares extreme learning machine;squared error loss function;synthetic regression problem;twin ELM methods;twin extreme learning machine;type II maximum likelihood algorithm","","1","","42","","20141120","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper reports the design and performance evaluation of an effective and efficient method to automatically detect sleep arousals using a single channel EEG. A detection model, based on a Curious Extreme Learning Machine (C-ELM), using a set of 22 features is proposed.

The Quantized Kernel Least-Squares (QKLMS) is an effective tool for online dictionary learning where the network size is capped by the quantization dictionary size.

Optimal trajectory generation is a major part of Space Launch Vehicle (SLV) design and if it is robust relative to uncertainties can improve vehicle reliability, safety and operational cost. This paper presents a combination of Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in order to create an appropriate trajectory metamodel for reducing computational time of robust trajectory design optimization of a two-stage-to-orbit SLV. The sampled data of LHS is then used as training data for ELM. Complex and costly uncertainty analyses are replaced by an ELM Neural Network (NN) which is used to instantaneously estimate the mean and standard deviation of objective function and constraints. The evolutionary genetic algorithm is used for global optimization of layers' connection weights and biases to minimize the learning error during learning phase of NN. A Hybrid Search Algorithm (HSA), which associates Simulated Annealing (SA) as a global optimizer with Simplex as a local optimizer is employed to find robust optimum point of this metamodel. The optimal and robust trajectories are compared.

Nonetheless, most real-world data streams feature highly uncertain characteristics, which cannot be handled by the type-1 EFC. A novel interval type-2 fuzzy classifier, namely evolving type-2 classifier (eT2Class), is proposed in this paper, which constructs an evolving working principle in the framework of interval type-2 fuzzy system. The eT2Class commences its learning process from scratch with an empty or initially trained rule base, and its fuzzy rules can be automatically grown, pruned, recalled, and merged on the fly referring to summarization power and generalization power of data streams. In addition, the eT2Class is driven by a generalized interval type-2 fuzzy rule, where the premise part is composed of the multivariate Gaussian function with an uncertain nondiagonal covariance matrix, while employing a subset of the nonlinear Chebyshev polynomial as the rule consequents. The efficacy of the eT2Class has been rigorously assessed by numerous real-world and artificial study cases, benchmarked against state-of-the-art classifiers, and validated through various statistical tests. Our numerical results demonstrate that the eT2Class produces more reliable classification rates, while retaining more compact and parsimonious rule base than state-of-the-art EFCs recently published in the literature.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2463732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7175005","Evolving neurofuzzy system;evolving fuzzy system;extreme learning machine;fuzzy neural network;fuzzy neural networks,;metacognitive learning;sequential learning;type-2 fuzzy system","Art;Chebyshev approximation;Covariance matrices;Fuzzy systems;Merging;Redundancy;Uncertainty","Chebyshev approximation;Gaussian processes;covariance matrices;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical testing","eT2Class;evolving type-2 fuzzy classifier;generalized interval type-2 fuzzy rule;interval type-2 fuzzy classifier;interval type-2 fuzzy system;learning process;multivariate Gaussian function;nondiagonal covariance matrix;nonlinear Chebyshev polynomial;real-world data stream feature;scratch;statistical tests;type-1 EFC","","5","","48","","20150803","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The SJSSP is an NP-hard problem. Current methods to solve the SJSSP ignored characteristics of SJSSP, which lead to large computation times and inefficient solutions. In order to efficiently solve the SJSSP, a method that integrates the ant colony system (ACS) and ordinal optimization (OO), abbreviated as ACSOO, is proposed to find a good enough schedule in a reasonable computation time. The proposed ACSOO utilizes the advantage of multi-directional search in ACS and goal softening in OO. The SJSSP is firstly formulated as a constraint stochastic simulation optimization problem.

Two random complex valued input-hidden weights are generated which project the complex-valued input on two random hyper-planes. The ratio of two random projections of input is used as aggregation function. An algebraic function has been used as the activation function.

Dynamic pricing, a straightforward implementation of demand response, may provide the means to manipulate the grid load thus extending the life expectancy of current technology. However, to integrate a dynamic pricing scheme in the crowded pool of technologies, available at demand side, a proper energy manager with the support of a pricing profile forecaster is mandatory. Although energy management and price forecasting are recurrent topics, in literature they have been addressed separately. On the other hand, in this work, the aim is to investigate how well an energy manager is able to perform in presence of data uncertainty originating from the forecasting process. On purpose, an energy and resource manager has been revised and extended in the current manuscript. Finally, it has been complemented with a price forecasting technique, based on the Extreme Learning Machine paradigm. The proposed forecaster has proven to be better performing and more robust, with respect to the most common forecasting approaches. The energy manager, as well, has proven that the energy efficiency of the residential environment can be improved significantly. Nonetheless, to achieve the theoretical optimum, forecasting techniques tailored for that purpose may be required.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4799-1960-4; POD:978-1-4799-1961-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280621","Dynamic Price Forecasting;Energy Management;Extreme Learning Machine;Mixed-Integer Linear Programming;Neural Networks;Smart Micro Grid","Support vector machines;Thermal management","demand side management;distributed power generation;energy management systems;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;pricing","data uncertainty;demand side management;dynamic pricing strategies;energy efficiency;energy management;extreme learning machine paradigm;microgrid scenarios;price forecasting technique;pricing profile forecaster","","","","21","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On one hand, the visual perception helps acquire the objects apparent characteristics (e.g., shape and color) that are paramount for grasp planning. On the other hand, when grasping the object, the tactile sensors can detect the softness or stiffness and the surface texture of the object, thus can be used to classify the objects. In this paper, two different tactile models are first developed to model the tactile sequences, namely bag-of-system (BoS) and deep dynamical system (DDS). To be specific, BoS applies the extreme learning machine method as the classifier, and DDS employs deep neural networks as the feature mapping functions in order to deal with the highly nonlinear data. As for visual sensing, we formulate a signature of histograms of orientations descriptor to model the shape of objects. Moreover, by using human experience, we identify the graspable components of objects on the category level instead of the object level.

First, a deep convolutional neural network is used to detect vehicles in the candidate region and a data set would be generated. Second, the main features of vehicles can be extracted using a fully-connected network. Also, for the sake of higher accuracy, weak labels given by pre-trained extreme learning machine (ELM) are fused into the final features, adding prior information proportionally. Third, K-means is implemented to learn three vehicle-type cluster centers adaptively. Finally, vehicle type will be recognized according to the closest distance principal.

In this investigation, we will present a technic to extract features throughout different abstraction levels in order to classify malware codes. This analysis is based on three factors: the position where the malware is detected, the functions' calls from each Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) and the ten most frequently visited hexadecimals per each malware sample. Once those characteristics are obtained, a descriptive vector of each malware is built. This vector works as a training to different learning machines types (SVM, IBL, and Decision Tree) and as a classification of the variations of malware codes (Virus, Backdoor, Trojan, and Adware). The result in the precision of the classification was 78.38% average where 3 types of learning machines were combined. The classified type as virus and algorithm IB1 (Instance Based Learning, IBL) were considered more accurate.

"Identifying (Quasi) Equally Informative Subsets in Feature Selection Problems for Classification: A Max-Relevance Min-Redundancy Approach","G. Karakaya; S. Galelli; S. D. Ahipaşaoğlu; R. Taormina","Pillar of Engineering Systems and Design, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore","IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","20160513","2016","46","6","1424","1437","An emerging trend in feature selection is the development of two-objective algorithms that analyze the tradeoff between the number of features and the classification performance of the model built with these features. Since these two objectives are conflicting, a typical result stands in a set of Pareto-efficient subsets, each having a different cardinality and a corresponding discriminating power. However, this approach overlooks the fact that, for a given cardinality, there can be several subsets with similar information content. The study reported here addresses this problem, and introduces a novel multiobjective feature selection approach conceived to identify: 1) a subset that maximizes the performance of a given classifier and 2) a set of subsets that are quasi equally informative, i.e., have almost same classification performance, to the performance maximizing subset. The approach consists of a wrapper [Wrapper for Quasi Equally Informative Subset Selection (W-QEISS)] built on the formulation of a four-objective optimization problem, which is aimed at maximizing the accuracy of a classifier, minimizing the number of features, and optimizing two entropy-based measures of relevance and redundancy. This allows conducting the search in a larger space, thus enabling the wrapper to generate a large number of Pareto-efficient solutions. The algorithm is compared against the mRMR algorithm, a two-objective wrapper and a computationally efficient filter [Filter for Quasi Equally Informative Subset Selection (F-QEISS)] on 24 University of California, Irvine, (UCI) datasets including both binary and multiclass classification. Experimental results show that W-QEISS has the capability of evolving a rich and diverse set of Pareto-efficient solutions, and that their availability helps in: 1) studying the tradeoff between multiple measures of classification performance and 2) understanding the relative importance of each feature. The quasi equally informative subsets are id- ntified at the cost of a marginal increase in the computational time thanks to the adoption of Borg Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm and Extreme Learning Machine as global optimization and learning algorithms, respectively.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2444435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150365","Classification algorithms;extreme learning machine;feature selection;multiobjective optimization;neural networks;redundancy;relevance","Accuracy;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Redundancy;Silicon;Support vector machines;Training","Pareto optimisation;evolutionary computation;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","Borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;Pareto-efficient solutions;Pareto-efficient subsets;UCI datasets;binary classification;classification performance;entropy-based measure;extreme learning machine;four-objective optimization problem;information content;informative subsets identification;mRMR algorithm;max-relevance min-redundancy approach;multiclass classification;multiobjective feature selection approach;redundancy measure;relevance measure;two-objective algorithms;wrapper","","1","","43","","20150706","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There are two important components to be considered for better genre classification, which are audio feature extraction and classifier. This paper incorporates two different kinds of features for genre classification, timbral texture and rhythmic content features. Timbral texture contains the Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) with other several spectral features. Before choosing a timbral feature we explore which feature contributes a less significant role on genre discrimination. This facilitates the reduction of feature dimension. For the timbral features up to the 4-th order central moments and the covariance components of mutual features are considered to improve the overall classification result. For the rhythmic content the features extracted from beat histogram are selected. In the paper Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with bagging is used as the classifier for classifying the genres. Based on the proposed feature sets and classifier, experiments are performed with two well-known datasets: GTZAN and the ISMIR2004 databases with ten and six different music genres, respectively.

They are then used to train an ensemble classifier which comprises a set of randomized neural networks called extreme learning machine (ELM). The optimal parameter settings for each ELM are identified through evolutionary computation (EC). An adaptive decision mechanism is designed to progressively adjust the decision time of the events classification, where its decision speed can be significantly improved over existing methods.

Trending topics collects the current Internet trends and topics of argument of each and every user. In order to overcome the problem of feature extraction,this work initially extracts many features such as user profile features, user activity features, location based features and text and content features. Then the extracted text features use Jenson-Shannon Divergence (JSD) measure to characterize each labeled tweet using natural language models. Different features are extracted from collected trending topics data in twitter. After features are extracted, clusters are formed to group similar trending topics of tweet user profile. Fuzzy K-means (FKM) algorithm primarily cluster the similar user profiles with same trending topics of tweet and centers are determined to similar user profiles with same trending topics of tweet from fuzzy membership function. Moreover, Extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is applied to analyze the growing characteristics of spam with similar topics in twitter from clustering result and acquire necessary knowledge in the detection of spam.

The method then uses the Feature Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (FIELM) model to further verify the discriminant ability of each kind of selected features. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively select the most significant features for SVD detection, which include gait and agility performance features.

So, it is significant to predict the caustic ratio on-line. On the basis of the reaction mechanism in the digestion process, a mechanistic model based on material balance for the caustic ratio was built. The fuzzy expert rules for caustic ratio prediction were summarized according to the operating experiences by taking the production conditions as inputs. The mechanistic model and the expert model are integrated. A kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) model was then built to compensate the integrated model, which uses time series of the error of the integrated model as inputs. So, finally, an integrated prediction model for the caustic ratio was established by parallel connection of the corrected mechanism model with the compensation model. The validation results showed that the integrated prediction model can effectively solve the problem of on-line measurement, which gives a foundation for the optimal control in the alumina digestion process.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-9713-1; Electronic:978-1-4673-9714-8; POD:978-1-4673-9715-5","10.1109/CCDC.2016.7531101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7531101","Caustic ratio prediction;Fuzzy expert rules;Kernel extreme learning machine;Mechanistic model","Calcium;Kernel;Niobium;Predictive models;Silicon compounds;Temperature;Time series analysis","alumina;aluminium industry;learning (artificial intelligence);optimal control;pH;production engineering computing;time series","Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>;KELM model;alumina digestion process;caustic ratio fluctuation;caustic ratio prediction;delayed process control;expert model;integrated model error time series;integrated prediction model;kernel extreme learning machine model;material balance;mechanistic model;off-line analysis;online measurement problem;optimal control;production conditions;reaction mechanism;time delay","","","","","","","28-30 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As for the selection of training samples, our proposed method uses two groups of thresholds instead of just one threshold to enhance the quality of the selected training samples by allowing for their selection in an intelligent manner. In order to achieve high CD accuracy, spatial information such as texture and morphological profiles are utilized in conjunction with spectral information.

Nonetheless, recognizing human by gait is not a trivial task due to the complex human kinematic structure and other external factors affecting human locomotion. A major challenge in gait recognition is view variation. A large difference between the views in the query and reference sets often leads to performance deterioration. In this paper, we show how to generate virtual views to compensate the view difference in the query and reference sets, making it possible to match the query and reference sets using standardized views. The proposed method, which combines multiview matrix representation and a novel randomized kernel extreme learning machine, is an end-to-end solution for view change problem under Grassmann manifold treatment. Under the right condition, the view-tagging problem can be eliminated. Since the recording angle and walking direction of the subject are not always available, this is particularly valuable for a practical gait recognition system. We present several working scenarios for multiview recognition that have not be considered before. Rigorous experiments have been conducted on two challenging benchmark databases containing multiview gait datasets.

This becomes an issue when dealing with costly problems. Surrogate models may overcome this difficulty, though their use in problems with medium to large dimensionality is underexplored in the literature. Problems with multiple conflicting objectives can be formulated as Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs). MOPs have received a great attention lately, mainly with Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). This paper proposes ELMOEA/D-DE, a surrogate-assisted MOEA, for solving expensive MOPs in small evaluation budgets. ELMOEA/D-DE encompasses a state-of-the-art MOEA based on decomposition, Differential Evolution (DE) operators and Extreme Learning Machines. This paper tests three variants of ELMOEA/D-DE, using different DE operators, for solving five known benchmark MOPs with 10 to 60 decision variables. All variants achieve good results in terms of hyper volume metric and the best variant with operator DE/rand/1/bin is compared with two state-of-the-art approaches (MOEA/D-RBF and a non-surrogate-based MOEA), achieving the best results in all but one problems instances.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5618-0; POD:978-1-4799-7859-5","10.1109/BRACIS.2014.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984850","decomposition;differential evolution;extreme learning machine;multi-objective optimization;surrogate model","Computational modeling;Measurement;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Training;Vectors","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation","ELMOEA/D-DE;decomposition;differential evolution;extreme learning machine;extreme learning surrogate model;hyper volume metric;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization problem;surrogate-assisted MOEA","","3","","18","","","18-22 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
