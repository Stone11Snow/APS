The strategy, which divides the whole task into several sub-tasks based on the sample division strategy, uses master-slave mode on the design of parallel program, and finally the master node produce a regression mode by collecting training results.

However, little work has been done to evaluate the cross-layer impact of rate adaptive algorithms in WMN environments. In this paper, we compare the performance of several rate adaptive algorithms to exploit the multi-hop performance in WMN environments. In addition, a novel rate adaptive algorithm is proposed via the machine learning approach to robustly reflect the channel information. The goal of our design is to maximize the spectral efficiency. Through extensive computer simulations under different channel and topology environments, experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms other existing algorithms in WMN environments.","2166-0077;21660077","POD:978-1-4244-5626-0","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2009.5360718","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360718","","Adaptive algorithm;Fading;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mesh networks;Robustness;Routing;Signal to noise ratio;Statistics;Wireless mesh networks","adaptive signal processing;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication network routing;telecommunication standards;wireless LAN","802.11;channel information;machine learning;multihop performance;rate adaptation algorithm;rate adaptive algorithm;routing algorithm;wireless mesh network","","1","","16","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While some studies investigate a handful of such metrics in a comparative fashion, an evaluation of specific relationships among a large set of commonly-used performance metrics is much needed in the data mining and machine learning community. This study provides a unique insight into the underlying relationships among classifier performance metrics. We do so with a large case study involving 35 datasets from various domains and the C4.5 decision tree algorithm. A common property of the 35 datasets is that they suffer from the class imbalance problem. Our approach is based on applying factor analysis to the classifier performance space which is characterized by 22 performance metrics. It is shown that such a large number of performance metrics can be grouped into two-to-four relationship-based groups extracted by factor analysis. This work is a step in the direction of providing the analyst with an improved understanding about the different relationships and groupings among the performance metrics, thus facilitating the selection of performance metrics that capture relatively independent aspects of a classifier's performance.","1082-3409;10823409","POD:978-1-4244-5619-2","10.1109/ICTAI.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364367","binary classification;factor analysis;metrics relationship;performance metrics","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Data mining;Decision trees;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information science;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation","data mining;decision trees","classifier performance metrics;data mining;decision tree algorithm;factor analysis;group extraction;machine learning","","24","","20","","","2-4 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prior work related to such auto-annotation assumed that a vocabulary of labels of interest (e. g., indoor, outdoor, city, landscape) is specified a priori. In contrast, the proposed method begins with an empty vocabulary. It analyzes audiovisual features of 25 million YouTube. com videos - nearly 150 years of video data -- effectively searching for consistent correlation between these features and text metadata. It autonomously extends the label vocabulary as and when it discovers concepts it can reliably identify, eventually leading to a vocabulary with thousands of labels and growing.

Correctly detecting, identifying, and understanding the changes of data distributions can help us properly select data samples or algorithms for learning models. However, since the training datasets are often in high dimensionality and large size, it has been difficult to effectively analyze them. Furthermore, the joint distribution between features and labels makes the problem more difficult to handle. In this paper, we propose a visual analysis method (VisGBT) that combines the gradient-boosting-trees (GBT) modeling method, regression analysis, and multidimensional visualization to capture the mismatches between datasets and models. The GBT model consists of a series of trees with a predefined number of terminal (leaf) nodes per tree. These terminal nodes partition the high dimensional space with a few most informative features to minimize the label prediction error. VisGBT maps various kinds of detailed model information to the terminal node matrix (TNM) and visualizes it with an appropriate design. With this visual analysis method, we can easily find out the detailed differences between datasets with the help of a learned model. We will illustrate the use of various visual patterns and in particular show how this method can help us analyze domain similarity for domain adaptation.","","CD-ROM:978-963-9799-76-9","10.4108/ICST.COLLABORATECOM2009.8281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362573","","Computer science;Costs;Data analysis;Data engineering;Data visualization;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Multidimensional systems;Regression analysis;Training data","data visualisation;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;regression analysis;trees (mathematics)","VisGBT;adaptive machine learning;data streams;domain adaptation;evolving training datasets;feature distribution;gradient-boosting-trees modeling method;label distribution;label prediction error;learning drifting concepts;multidimensional visualization;regression analysis;terminal node matrix;tree nodes;visual analysis method;visual patterns","","0","","35","","","11-14 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there has been little focus on how these same dependencies affect our ability to draw accurate conclusions about the performance of the models. More specifically, the complex link structure and attribute dependencies in network data violate the assumptions of many conventional statistical tests and make it difficult to use these tests to assess the models in an unbiased manner. In this work, we examine the task of within-network classification and the question of whether two algorithms will learn models which will result in significantly different levels of performance. We show that the commonly-used form of evaluation (paired t-test on overlapping network samples) can result in an unacceptable level of Type I error. Furthermore we show that Type I error increases as (1) the correlation among instances increases and (2) the size of the evaluation set increases (i.e., the proportion of labeled nodes in the network decreases). We propose a method for network cross-validation that combined with paired t-tests produces more acceptable levels of Type I error while still providing reasonable levels of statistical power (i.e., Type II error).","1550-4786;15504786","POD:978-1-4244-5242-2","10.1109/ICDM.2009.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360265","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Laboratories;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Performance analysis;Probability;Standards development;Taxonomy;Testing","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;relational databases;statistical testing","complex link structure;data mining;machine learning;network cross-validation;relational data;statistical test;within-network classifier","","4","","26","","","6-9 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several processes of the same workload are necessary to obtain a 2D-HMM model of the workload.

PTSVM (progressive transductive support vector machine) can automatically adapt to different data distributions and realize a transductive learning of support vectors in a more general sense. However, the process of pairwise labeling of PTSVM in the margin band is unnatural and products errors more easily. Although dynamical adjusting offers some sort of error recovery function, its ability is limited. In allusion to the shortcomings of PTSVM learning algorithm, ICPTSVM (an improved cache-based PTSVM) learning algorithm is presented. The algorithm uses pairwise labeling in the range and error-correcting on cache to replace pairwise labeling in the margin band and dynamical adjusting. Then it greatly reduces the number of mis-labeling and improves the speed and accuracy.

In the second stage for feature selection, Markov blanket is built up with the consideration of feature interaction. To evaluate its performance, eight disease datasets from UCI machine learning database are chosen and four off-the-shelf classification algorithms are used for comparison.

Empirical results show that the new method decreases the prediction error of minority class significantly with increasing the prediction error of majority class a little bit.

During mammography screening, radiologists use a strict lexicon (BI-RADS) to describe and report their findings. Mammography records are then stored in a well-defined database format (NMD). Lately, researchers have applied data mining and machine learning techniques to these databases. They successfully built breast cancer classifiers that can help in early detection of malignancy. However, the validity of these models depends on the quality of the underlying databases. Unfortunately, most databases suffer from inconsistencies, missing data, inter-observer variability and inappropriate term usage. In addition, many databases are not compliant with the NMD format and/or solely consist of text reports. BI-RADS feature extraction from free text and consistency checks between recorded predictive variables and text reports are crucial to addressing this problem. We describe a general scheme for concept information retrieval from free text given a lexicon, and present a BI-RADS features extraction algorithm for clinical data mining. It consists of a syntax analyzer, a concept finder and a negation detector. The syntax analyzer preprocesses the input into individual sentences. The concept finder uses a semantic grammar based on the BI-RADS lexicon and the experts' input. It parses sentences detecting BI-RADS concepts. Once a concept is located, a lexical scanner checks for negation. Our method can handle multiple latent concepts within the text, filtering out ultrasound concepts. On our dataset, our algorithm achieves 97.7% precision, 95.5% recall and an F<sub>1</sub>-score of 0.97. It outperforms manual feature extraction at the 5% statistical significance level.","2375-9232;23759232","POD:978-1-4244-5384-9","10.1109/ICDMW.2009.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360530","","Breast cancer;Cancer detection;Data mining;Data preprocessing;Detectors;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Mammography;Spatial databases","cancer;data mining;feature extraction;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography","BI-RADS feature extraction;breast cancer classifiers;clinical data mining;concept finder;free text;information extraction;machine learning techniques;mammography case study;negation detector;semantic grammar;syntax analyzer","","7","","34","","","6-6 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there is still a significant challenge for bridging the semantic gap between structured geospatial data in GISs and un-analytical spatial information in natural language. The representation and analysis of spatial relations has been one of generic issues in geographical information science. This paper presents a rule-based approach to spatial relation extraction in natural language text. Based on geographical named entity recognition technology and a spatial relation annotation corpus, syntactical rules of spatial relations are induced and then formalized into JAPE of the natural language processing platform GATE. Geographical named entities and spatial relations in new documents can be detected effectively in GATE. The experimental results indicate that spatial relations are usually described with several syntactical patterns in natural language, especially directional spatial relations, but topological relations are much more complicated. The fact is that rule-based extraction approaches can be implemented and integrated by means of fewer efforts than machine learning algorithms. It is known that directional spatial relations are more popularly used in natural language than topological spatial relations. Therefore, we conclude that it is practical and effective to extract spatial relations in natural language with rule-based approaches.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363900","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363900","","Cities and towns;Data mining;Geography;Information analysis;Information science;Information systems;Layout;Machine learning algorithms;Natural language processing;Natural languages","geographic information systems;knowledge based systems;natural language processing","GATE;GIS;JAPE;geographical named entity recognition technology;intelligent geographical information system;natural language text;rule-based extraction;spatial relation annotation corpus;spatial relation extraction;structured geospatial data","","5","","18","","","11-13 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance is restricted by the availability of labeled words. To tackle this issue, we propose a semi-supervised approach to improve the sequence labeling procedure in IE through a class of algorithms with self-learned features (SLF). A supervised classifier can be trained with annotated text sequences and used to classify each word in a large set of unannotated sentences. By averaging predicted labels over all cases in the unlabeled corpus, SLF training builds class label distribution patterns for each word (or word attribute) in the dictionary and re-trains the current model iteratively adding these distributions as extra word features. Basic SLF models how likely a word could be assigned to target class types. Several extensions are proposed, such as learning words' class boundary distributions. SLF exhibits robust and scalable behaviour and is easy to tune. We applied this approach on four classical IE tasks: named entity recognition (German and English), part-of-speech tagging (English) and one gene name recognition corpus. Experimental results show effective improvements over the supervised baselines on all tasks.

To solve this machine learning problem, we consider a memetic Pareto evolutionary approach based on the NSGA2 algorithm (MPENSGA2), where we defined two objectives for determining the goodness of a classifier: the cross-entropy error function and the variation coefficient of its sensitivities, because both measures are continuous functions, making the convergence more robust. Once the Pareto front is built, we use an automatic selection methodology of individuals: the best model in accuracy (upper extreme in the Pareto front). This methodology is applied to solve six benchmark classification problems, obtaining promising results and achieving a high classification rate in the generalization set with an acceptable level of accuracy for each class.","2164-7143;21647143","POD:978-1-4244-4735-0","10.1109/ISDA.2009.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364897","Classification;Entropy;Multi-objective;Neural Networks;Variation Coefficient","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial neural networks;Convergence;Entropy;Evolutionary computation;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks","Pareto optimisation;entropy;evolutionary computation;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pattern classification","NSGA2 algorithm;Pareto front;artificial neural networks;automatic selection methodology;benchmark classification problems;cross-entropy error function;generalization set;machine learning problem;memetic Pareto evolutionary algorithm;memetic Pareto evolutionary approach;multiclassification pattern algorithm;multilayer perceptron neural network models;objectives entropy;variation coefficient","","0","","19","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Algorithms for segmenting mostly belong to the supervised learning family, where a labeled corpus is available to the algorithm in the learning phase. We are interested, however, in the unsupervised scenario, where the algorithm never sees examples of successful segmentation, but still needs to discover meaningful segments. In this paper we present an unsupervised learning algorithm for segmenting sequences of symbols or categorical events. Our algorithm, Hierarchical Multigram, hierarchically builds a lexicon of segments and computes a maximum likelihood segmentation given the current lexicon. Thus, our algorithm is most appropriate to hierarchical sequences, where smaller segments are grouped into larger segments. Our probabilistic approach also allows us to suggest conditional entropy as a measurement of the quality of a segmentation in the absence of labeled data. We compare our algorithm to two previous approaches from the unsupervised segmentation literature, showing it to provide superior segmentation over a number of benchmarks. We also compare our algorithm to previous approaches over a segmentation of the unlabeled interactions of a web service and its client.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:978-1-4244-5242-2","10.1109/ICDM.2009.87","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360342","Multigram;Segmentation;Software analysis","Application software;Data mining;Entropy;Humans;Information systems;Instruments;Machine learning;Software maintenance;Voting;Web services","Web services;discrete event systems;entropy;hierarchical systems;unsupervised learning","benchmarks;conditional entropy;discrete events;discrete symbols;hierarchical multigram;hierarchical probabilistic segmentation;lexicon;maximum likelihood segmentation;supervised learning family;unsupervised learning algorithm;unsupervised segmentation literature;web service","","0","","10","","","6-9 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a generalized sparse metric learning method (GSML). This novel framework offers a unified view for understanding many of the popular sparse metric learning algorithms including the sparse metric learning framework proposed, the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN), and the D-ranking vector machine (D-ranking VM). Moreover, GSML also establishes a close relationship with the pairwise support vector machine. Furthermore, the proposed framework is capable of extending many current non-sparse metric learning models such as relevant vector machine (RCA) and a state-of-the-art method proposed into their sparse versions. We present the detailed framework, provide theoretical justifications, build various connections with other models, and propose a practical iterative optimization method, making the framework both theoretically important and practically scalable for medium or large datasets.

The central challenge in optimizing various measures of ranking loss is that the objectives tend to be non-convex and discontinuous. To make such functions amenable to gradient based optimization procedures one needs to design clever bounds. In recent years, boosting, neural networks, support vector machines, and many other techniques have been applied. However, there is little work on directly modeling a conditional probability Pr(y|x<sub>q</sub>) where y is a permutation of the documents to be ranked and x<sub>q</sub> represents their feature vectors with respect to a query q. A major reason is that the space of y is huge: n! if n documents must be ranked. We first propose an intuitive and appealing expected loss minimization objective, and give an efficient shortcut to evaluate it despite the huge space of ys. Unfortunately, the optimization is non-convex, so we propose a convex approximation. We give a new, efficient Monte Carlo sampling method to compute the objective and gradient of this approximation, which can then be used in a quasi-Newton optimizer like LBFGS.

Unfortunately, the previously proposed methods based on information entropy for feature selection only focus on the discrete datasets. However, how to effectively discretize the continuous datasets is also full of challenge, since this method may lead to loss of some useful information. To overcome this disadvantage, in this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm based on conditional entropy by clustering strategy for feature selection (ACECFS). In ACECFS, the projected data corresponding to each feature is appropriately separated into several clusters at first, and then the conditional entropy for a set of features is conveniently computed by the clusters and corresponding feature list is generated, hence an effectively relevant and compact feature subset can be obtained from the ranked feature list.

The paper shows that the results have been improved when comparing with only using baseline classifiers such as Decision Tree (DT), Bayesian Networks (BN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to the original datasets.","2164-7143;21647143","POD:978-1-4244-4735-0","10.1109/ISDA.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364086","","Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Degradation;Information systems;Intelligent systems;Learning systems;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor searches;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;belief networks;decision trees;education;support vector machines","Bayesian networks;academic performance prediction;class imbalance;cost-sensitive learning;decision tree;machine learning;support vector machines","","8","","23","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There has already been significant research into this endeavor for historical text; however, in this work we consider the problem of adding hyperlinks among graphic elements. While such a system would not have the ubiquitous utility of text-based hyperlinks, as we will show, there are several domains where it can significantly augment textual information. While OCR of historical text is known to be a difficult problem, the actual words themselves are inherently discrete. Thus, two words are either identical or not. This means that off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms, including semi-supervised learning, can be easily used. However, as we shall demonstrate, semi-supervised learning does not work well with images, because we cannot expect binary matching decisions. Rather we must deal with degrees of matching. In this work we make the novel observation that this Â¿degree of matchingÂ¿ biased algorithms make overly confident predictions about simple shapes. We show that a simple technique for correcting this bias, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method significantly improves accuracy on diverse historical image collections.","","POD:978-1-4244-5231-6","10.1109/ISM.2009.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362526","Historical Manuscripts;Hyperlinks;Semi-Supervised Learning","Books;Computer science;Euclidean distance;Graphics;Humans;Machine learning algorithms;Optical character recognition software;Semisupervised learning;Shape measurement;USA Councils","learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","automatic hyperlinks;binary matching decisions;degree of matching biased algorithms;digital collection browsing;digitized historical documents;diverse historical image collections;historical manuscript augmentation;off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms;semisupervised learning;text-based hyperlinks;textual information augmentation;ubiquitous utility","","1","","23","","","14-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each training example in meta-learning (i.e. each meta-example) is related to a learning problem and stores features of the problem plus the performance obtained by a set of candidate algorithms when evaluated on the problem. Based on a set of such meta-examples, a meta-learner will be used to predict algorithm performance for new problems. The generation of a set of meta-examples can be expensive, since for each problem it is necessary to perform an empirical evaluation of the candidate algorithms. In a previous work, we proposed the active meta-learning, in which active learning was used to reduce the set of meta-examples by selecting only the most relevant problems for meta-example generation. In the current work, we proposed the combination of different uncertainty sampling methods for active meta-learning, considering that each individual method will provide useful information that can be combined in order to have a better assessment of problem relevance for meta-example generation.

Corrado","Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","2009 11th IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","20091228","2009","","","645","650","We present a new approach to learning sparse, spatiotemporal codes in which the number of basis vectors, their orientations, velocities and the size of their receptive fields change over the duration of unsupervised training. The algorithm starts with a relatively small, initial basis with minimal temporal extent. This initial basis is obtained through conventional sparse coding techniques and is expanded over time by recursively constructing a new basis consisting of basis vectors with larger temporal extent that proportionally conserve regions of previously trained weights. These proportionally conserved weights are combined with the result of adjusting newly added weights to represent a greater range of primitive motion features. The size of the current basis is determined probabilistically by sampling from existing basis vectors according to their activation on the training set. The resulting algorithm produces bases consisting of filters that are bandpass, spatially oriented and temporally diverse in terms of their transformations and velocities. The basic methodology borrows inspiration from the layer-by-layer learning of multiple-layer restricted Boltzmann machines developed by Geoff Hinton and his students. Indeed, we can learn multiple-layer sparse codes by training a stack of denoising autoencoders, but we have had greater success using L<sub>1</sub> regularized regression in a variation on Olshausen and Field's original SPARSENET. To accelerate learning and focus attention, we apply a space-time interest-point operator that selects for periodic motion. This attentional mechanism enables us to efficiently compute and compactly represent a broad range of interesting motion. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to recognize human activity in video.

"Enhancing prediction understandability for transmembane segments by BoostingFOIL","Jieyue He; Pingping Chen; Dejing Zhao; Wei Zhong","School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China","2009 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems","20091228","2009","1","","739","743","In recent years, many studies have focused on improving the accuracy of prediction of trans-membrane segments, and many significant results have been achieved. In spite of these considerable results, the existing methods lack the ability to explain the process of how a learning result is reached and why a prediction decision is made. The explanation of the decision process is important for acceptance of machine learning technology in bioinformatics applications such as protein structure prediction. Decision trees provide insightful interpretation, with form of the propositional IF-THEN rules. The decision tree algorithm produces a large number of rules which is not easy to read and difficult to express adequately complex characteristics of biological sequence. First-order rules with variables have outstanding representation capability, and they can be used to reduce the number of rules. Therefore, in this paper, we present an innovative approach to generate rules for understanding prediction of transmembrane segments. This new approach combines the first-order inductive learning (FOIL) with enhancing techniques of Boosting to produce a new algorithm called BoostingFOIL. The experimental results for prediction of transmembrane segments on 165 low-resolution test data set show that not only the comprehensibility of BoostingFOIL is much better than that of decision tree, but also the test accuracy of these rules is higher as well. The most important contribution of our work is that the first-order rules produced by BoostingFOIL can be easily applied to advanced deduction in inductive learning procedure.","","POD:978-1-4244-4754-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358389","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358389","Decision tree;First Order Inductive Learner;Transmembrane segments prediction","Bioinformatics;Computer science;Decision making;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Machine learning;Proteins;Support vector machines;Testing","bioinformatics;biomembranes;decision making;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;proteins","BoostingFOIL algorithm;bioinformatics;decision tree;first-order inductive learning;inductive learning procedure;transmembane segments;transmembrane proteins","","0","","25","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In other words, it presents a novel method, called uncertain decision trees (UDT) to handle the uncertainty during the process of inducing decision trees. Here, uncertainty is depicted via cloud model theory, a quantitative-qualitative transforming model with uncertainty, which can well integrate the fuzziness and randomness of concepts in a unified way. In the learning stage, dataset is pre-processed by cloud transformation algorithm, which climbs data into class labels via histograms or frequency distribution, and the labels are expressed by cloud concepts. In this paper, some basic definitions are proposed, including cloud distance, cloud dissimilarity matrix, cloud index, and UDT, where cloud index is a novel splitting criterion of selecting attributes for handling uncertainty. Take data from UCI for example, this paper provided an algorithm inducing UDT, and checked its validity or appropriateness. In contrast to the classical approaches, both in the learning stage and classifying stage, the proposed method develops existing methods, and it is more consistent with the human cognition, which can support uncertainty, build UDT via cloud concepts, and classify the uncertain data. Moreover, experiments and results are compared with the current methods to illustrate the feasibility, accuracy and effectiveness of the cloud based algorithm.","","POD:978-0-7695-3810-5","10.1109/SKG.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368030","classifier;cloud model;data mining;decision tree;knowledge discovery;uncertain systems","Classification tree analysis;Clouds;Decision trees;Fuzzy sets;Induction generators;Information science;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement uncertainty;Software engineering;Uncertain systems","data mining;decision trees;uncertainty handling","cloud model;human cognition;learning stage;uncertain data;uncertain decision tree","","0","","11","","","12-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An effective Marr Wavelet kernel which we combine the wavelet theory with AOSVR (MW-AOSVR) to construct for traffic flow forecasting is presented in this paper. The forecasting performance of MW-AOSVR is evaluated by real-time traffic flow data of southbound US 101 Freeway, in Los Angeles, USA and a variety of experiments are carried out. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach with Marr Wavelet kernel provides more optimal performance than that with radial basis function (RBF) kernel and has much more precise forecasting rate and higher efficiency, especially for boundary approximation.","","POD:978-0-7695-3859-4","10.1109/IITA.2009.423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369419","#NAME?","Application software;Demand forecasting;Information technology;Intelligent transportation systems;Kernel;Machine learning;Space technology;Technology forecasting;Training data;Wavelet domain","radial basis function networks;regression analysis;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing;wavelet transforms","Marr wavelet kernel;boundary approximation;intelligent transportation systems;radial basis function kernel;realtime traffic flow forecasting;support vector regression;wavelet theory","","1","","9","","","21-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A problem arises for the handling of new users, when information about existing users is already available. In the work presented in this paper, we were following two approaches to derive information about new users, both based on prototype generation for existing user's answer pattern to a QoS related questionnaire. In the first approach, it was tried to classify user attributes to a fitting prototype. In the second approach, a mapping from partial answers to a prototype was used. As result, the first approach appeared to be infeasible, while the second one gave good results. In the resulting trade-off between the number of clusters and classification accuracy, this way it is possible, for example, with 8 prototypes for around 1000 users to issue a new user answer patterns by using only 30% of the questions, while reducing accuracy by only 13%.","","POD:978-1-4244-5165-4","10.1109/INCOS.2009.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369327","","Communication networks;Communication system control;Context;Intelligent networks;International collaboration;Learning systems;Machine learning;Process control;Process design;Prototypes","pattern classification;quality of service;user modelling","partial user supplied information;quality of service;user attribute classification;user modeling","","0","","7","","","4-6 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
