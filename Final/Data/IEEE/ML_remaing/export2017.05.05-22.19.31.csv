The information from these are processed and provided back to the travelers in real time. However, the travelers are interested to know not only the current traffic information, but also the future traffic conditions predicted based on the real time data. These predicted values inform the drivers on what they can expect when they make the trip. Travel time is one of the most popular variables which the users are interested to know. Travelers make decisions to bypass congested segments of the network, to change departure time or destination etc., based on this information. Hence it is important that the predicted values be as accurate as possible. A number of different forecasting methods have been proposed for travel time forecasting including historic method, real-time method, time series analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANN). This paper examines the use of a machine learning technique, namely support vector machines (SVM), for the short-term prediction of travel time. While other machine learning techniques, such as ANN, have been extensively studied, the reported applications of SVM in the field of transportation engineering are very few. A comparison of the performance of SVM with ANN, real time, and historic approach is carried out. Data from the TransGuide Traffic Management center in San Antonio, Texas, USA is used for the analysis. From the results it was found that SVM is a viable alternative for short-term prediction problems when the amount of data is less or noisy in nature.","1931-0587;19310587","CD-ROM:1-4244-1068-1; POD:1-4244-1067-3","10.1109/IVS.2007.4290181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4290181","Inductive loop detectors;Machine learning techniques;Support vector machines;Travel time prediction","Artificial neural networks;Information management;Machine learning;North America;Real time systems;Support vector machines;Surveillance;Telecommunication traffic;Time series analysis;Transportation","neural nets;support vector machines;transportation","artificial neural network;machine learning;support vector machine;transportation engineering;travel time prediction;urban transportation system","","21","5","23","","","13-15 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, graph-based semi supervised learning has been becoming one of the most active research areas in the semi supervised learning community. In this paper, a novel graph-based semi supervised learning approach is proposed based on a linear neighborhood model, which assumes that each data point can be linearly reconstructed from its neighborhood. Our algorithm, named linear neighborhood propagation (LNP), can propagate the labels from the labeled points to the whole data set using these linear neighborhoods with sufficient smoothness. A theoretical analysis of the properties of LNP is presented in this paper. Furthermore, we also derive an easy way to extend LNP to out-of-sample data.

A major issue of developing a meta-search engine is how to integrate search results of different search engines. We propose a merging strategy that uses five features to estimate the merging score of a result entity. All result entities reported by source search engines are merged into one ranked list according to their merging scores. We intend to generate a high precision ranked list by raising the ranks of the documents that are in the medical domain. We conduct a search task to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. Experimental results show that our meta-search engine performs better than Google Web search engine.

Several approaches have been used to address the problem of predicting PPI. Some of them are based on biological features extracted from a protein sequence (such as, amino acid composition, GO terms, etc.); others use relational and structural features extracted from the PPI network, which can be represented as a graph. Our approach falls in the second category. We adapt a general approach to graph feature extraction that has previously been applied to collaborative recommendation of friends in social networks. Several structural features are identified based on the PPI graph and used to learn classifiers for predicting new interactions. Two datasets containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI are used to test the proposed approach. Both these datasets were assembled from the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP). We assembled the first data set directly from DIP in April 2006, while the second data set has been used in previous studies, thus making it easy to compare our approach with previous approaches. Several classifiers are trained using the structural features extracted from the interactions graph. The results show good performance (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity), proving that the structural features are highly predictive with respect to PPI.","","POD:1-4244-1509-8","10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375729","graph mining;machine learning;protein-protein interaction","Amino acids;Assembly;Collaboration;Data mining;Electronics packaging;Feature extraction;Protein sequence;Social network services;Spatial databases;Testing","association;biochemistry;biology computing;feature extraction;graphs;microorganisms;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;proteins","Saccharomyces cerevisiae;associations;classifiers;feature extraction;graph;protein sequence;protein-protein interactions;structural prediction","","1","","14","","","14-17 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed technique is an extension of the Gaussian process regression and applies to continuous valued readings subject to censoring. We treat the censored variable as a mixture of binary and a normal random variable. The Gaussian process framework provides a natural way of integrating information from both types of observations to estimate the parameters of the underlying random process.

This is in contrast with the majority of the literature, where a very generic AIS algorithm for data mining is developed and there is little or no concern in tailoring the components of the AIS for the data to be mined or the application domain. To support this problem-oriented approach, we provide an extensive critical review of the current literature on AIS for data mining, focusing on the data mining tasks of classification and anomaly detection. We discuss several important lessons to be taken from the natural immune system to design new AIS that are considerably more adaptive than current AIS.

While, in rough set theory, the discretization of continuous attributes is indispensable in any data preprocessing for the rough set computational intelligence algorithm and also critical to the quality of rule generated. To solve this problem, and based on the available researching achievements, we introduce the Self-Organizing feature Map (SOM) to cluster the original data into the required classes. In this paper, to direct the SOM clustering number of every continuous attribute, based on the indiscernibility discipline in Rough Set Theory, we define two new measurements-attribute Maximum Discernibility Value (MDV) and Attribute Redundancy Rate (ARR) as the strategic searching factros. MDV is employed to decide the heuristic strategy for the SOM neural network in the data preprocessing stage. And the ARR is for the attribute reduction as a effective feedback to the SOM clustering. Independent of domain experience, the combination of MDV, SOM, Skowron reduction, and the ARR can adjust the clustering number for every continuous attirbute automatically. Therefore, in theory, the computational speed is heightened greatly for the rough set attribute reduction. And in the end, a factual application case demonstrates the whole process effectively.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0759-1; POD:1-4244-0758-3","10.1109/ICVES.2006.371551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4233987","Attribute Discretization;Cluster;Machine Learning;Pattern Recognition;Rough Set;SOM","Computational intelligence;Computer integrated manufacturing;Data analysis;Data preprocessing;Machine learning;Manifolds;Neural networks;Neurofeedback;Pattern recognition;Set theory","data reduction;heuristic programming;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;rough set theory;search problems;self-organising feature maps","attribute redundancy rate;data preprocessing;heuristic SOM network;heuristic search strategy;machine learning;maximum discernibility value;pattern recognition model;rough set attribute reduction;rough set computational intelligence algorithm;self-organizing feature map data clustering","","1","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We employed a computational mutagenesis methodology, incorporating both sequence and structure information, to generate a feature vector representation for each of the isolated protease mutants. Training sets were prepared for seven protease inhibitors, each consisting of protease mutants with known phenotypes. Four machine-learning algorithms were implemented, and random forest performed best at distinguishing between sensitive/resistant mutants based on area under the ROC curve (0.81 -0.92). Trained models were used to make predictions about recently assayed protease mutants and displayed 83% agreement with the experimental data.

Initially, the system was built onto classic ontological knowledge representation for the use in a multi-agent system. Events occurring were classified using object matching with model events. After comparisons with type scenarios, the system could predict if a crisis can happen. A better understanding of crisis appeared and the system was completely working but, only if the main agent which has the task of questioning the user was replaced with a human because an ontological model is not well adapted for such work. This gives us motive to reconsider the role and the design of the system, stressing the need of a better knowledge management. A collection based knowledge representation seemed to be a good alternative to gather and organize critical information without losing time and information in a type matching process. It is one of the first times this concept of collection, well known in the artistic domain is used in an IT system. We will explain this particular knowledge representation through the successful example of the CHEOPS Project.","","POD:978-0-7695-3087-1","10.1109/ICDS.2008.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4456024","conflit modelling;crisis management;knowledge representation;machine learning;serious games","Crisis management;Economic forecasting;Environmental economics;Government;Humans;Knowledge management;Knowledge representation;Multiagent systems;Ontologies;Societies","knowledge management;multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);politics;risk analysis","collection-based knowledge representation;crisis management;geopolitical risks;knowledge management;multi-agent system;object matching;ontological knowledge representation","","3","","30","","","10-15 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We generated a data set by collecting 100 applications with EULAs and classifying each EULA as either good or bad. An experiment was conducted, in which 15 popular default-configured mining algorithms were applied on the EULA data set. The results show that 13 algorithms are significantly better than random guessing, thus we conclude that the hypothesis can be accepted. Moreover, 2 algorithms also perform significantly better than the current state-of-the-art EULA analysis method.

We marginalize out the model parameters in closed form by using Gaussian process priors for both the dynamical and the observation mappings. This results in a nonparametric model for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model.

Garrido","Univ. de Castilla-La Mancha, Albacete","IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","20080307","2008","18","2","172","185","The H.264 standard achieves much higher coding efficiency than the MPEG-2 standard, due to its improved inter-and intra-prediction modes at the expense of higher computational complexity. Transcoding MPEG-2 video to H.264 is important to enable gradual migration to H.264. However, given the significant differences between the MPEG-2 and the H.264 coding algorithms, transcoding is a much more complex task and new approaches to transcoding are necessary. The main problems that need to be addressed in the design of an efficient heterogeneous MPEG-2/H.264 transcoder are: the inter-frame prediction, the transform coding and the intra-frame prediction. In this paper, we focus our attention on the inter-frame prediction, the most computationally intensive task involved in the transcoding process. This paper presents a novel macroblock (MB) mode decision algorithm for P-frame prediction based on machine learning techniques to be used as part of a very low complexity MPEG-2 to H.264 video transcoder. Since coding mode decisions take up the most resources in video transcoding, a fast MB mode estimation would lead to reduced complexity. The proposed approach is based on the hypothesis that MB coding mode decisions in H.264 video have a correlation with the distribution of the motion compensated residual in MPEG-2 video. We use machine learning tools to exploit the correlation and construct decision trees to classify the incoming MPEG-2 MBs into one of the several coding modes in H.264. The proposed approach reduces the H.264 MB mode computation process into a decision tree lookup with very low complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces the MB mode selection complexity by as much as 95% while maintaining the coding efficiency. Finally, we conduct a comparative study with some of the most prominent fast inter-prediction methods for H.264 presented in the literature. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves the best results for video tran- - scoding applications.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2008.918115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448990","H.264;Inter-frame,;MPEG-2;MPEG-2,;Machine Learning;Transcoding;inter-frame;machine learning;transcoding","","computational complexity;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);transcoding;transform coding;video coding","H.264 P-frame transcoding;MB mode selection complexity;MPEG-2;computational complexity;decision tree lookup;fast MB mode decision algorithm;inter-prediction modes;intra-frame prediction;intra-prediction modes;machine learning techniques;macroblock mode decision algorithm;transform coding;video transcoding","","24","","30","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IP traceback, a counter measure against DDoS, is the ability to trace IP packets back to the true source/s of the attack. In this paper, an IP traceback scheme using a machine learning technique called intelligent decision prototype (IDP), is proposed. IDP can be used on both probabilistic packet marking (PPM) and deterministic packet marking (DPM) traceback schemes to identify DDoS attacks. This will greatly reduce the packets that are marked and in effect make the system more efficient and effective at tracing the source of an attack compared with other methods. IDP can be applied to many security systems such as data mining, forensic analysis, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and DDoS defense systems.","","POD:978-0-7695-3113-7","10.1109/PERCOM.2008.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4517459","Decision trees;Distributed Denial of Service;IP Traceback;Intelligent Decision Prototype;Machine Learning","Computer crime;Counting circuits;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Prototypes;Web services","Web services;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IP packets;Web services;data mining;deterministic packet marking;distributed denial of service attacks;forensic analysis;intelligent decision prototype;intrusion detection systems;probabilistic packet marking","","5","","29","","","17-21 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to other facial variations, aging variation presents several unique characteristics which make age estimation a challenging task. This paper proposes an automatic age estimation method named AGES (AGing pattErn Subspace). The basic idea is to model the aging pattern, which is defined as the sequence of a particular individual's face images sorted in time order, by constructing a representative subspace. The proper aging pattern for a previously unseen face image is determined by the projection in the subspace that can reconstruct the face image with minimum reconstruction error, while the position of the face image in that aging pattern will then indicate its age. In the experiments, AGES and its variants are compared with the limited existing age estimation methods (WAS and AAS) and some well-established classification methods (kNN, BP, C4.5, and SVM). Moreover, a comparison with human perception ability on age is conducted. It is interesting to note that the performance of AGES is not only significantly better than that of all the other algorithms, but also comparable to that of the human observers.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359348","Computer vision;age estimation;face and gesture recognition;machine learning;pattern recognition","Aging;Data mining;Face detection;Face recognition;Humans;Image databases;Image reconstruction;Pattern recognition;Senior members;Support vector machines","face recognition;gesture recognition;image reconstruction","aging pattern subspace;automatic age estimation;error reconstruction;face image reconstruction;facial aging pattern;human perception ability","Aging;Algorithms;Anthropometry;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Computer Simulation;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Anatomic;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","274","3","31","","","Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thus, finding the best possible learning model in combination with extracting the best possible feature-set is a necessary requirement to design accurate traffic classification models. While feature selection can be automated to find the best subset of a given set of features, there are no known mechanisms to solve the problem of feature extraction.

We believe that practical applications of complex fuzzy logic require inductive learning. We are taking a first step towards this by building an inductive learning algorithm ANCFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Complex Inference System), which hybridizes the theory of complex fuzzy inference and ANFIS. We believe that complex fuzzy sets will be a remarkably efficient way of modeling approximately periodic data. Thus, our proposed application of ANCFIS is in time series forecasting. We present an introduction to ANCFIS, its structure and computational formulas. The ANCFIS architecture is tested against three commonly cited time series datasets.

In the proposed model, the nonlinear distortion function is modeled by using high order polynomials which enable the model to be formulated and optimized in a tractable manner. The strength of the proposed approach lies in the closed estimation of the source signals and the adaptive optimization procedure of the model parameters.

To improve searches in these conditions, we made two refinements to a well-known query expansion method. One uses transductive learning to obtain pseudorelevant documents, thereby increasing the total number of source documents from which expansion terms can be extracted. The other is a modified parameter estimation method that aggregates the predictions of multiple learning trials to sort candidate terms for expansion by importance.

Given a multiclass problem, the ECOC technique designs a code word for each class, where each position of the code identifies the membership of the class for a given binary problem. A classification decision is obtained by assigning the label of the class with the closest code. One of the main requirements of the ECOC design is that the base classifier is capable of splitting each subgroup of classes from each binary problem. However, we cannot guarantee that a linear classifier model convex regions. Furthermore, nonlinear classifiers also fail to manage some type of surfaces. In this paper, we present a novel strategy to model multiclass classification problems using subclass information in the ECOC framework. Complex problems are solved by splitting the original set of classes into subclasses and embedding the binary problems in a problem-dependent ECOC design. Experimental results show that the proposed splitting procedure yields a better performance when the class overlap or the distribution of the training objects conceal the decision boundaries for the base classifier. The results are even more significant when one has a sufficiently large training size.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4459332","Classifier design and evaluation;Computing Methodologies;Design Methodology;Machine learning;Pattern Recognition;Statistical Models","","error correction codes","classification decision;error correcting output codes;multiclass classification model;nonlinear classifiers;subclass information","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","56","","28","","","June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we propose a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating learning algorithms directly with analog-to- digital conversion. At the core of the proposed approach is a novel regularized min-max optimization approach that yields ""delta-sigma"" limit-cycles.

Our idea is to implement a digital wall, which is a user-defined boundary so that access is allowed within the boundary and denied outside the boundary. To do this, we need to do accurate location estimation since the decision around the boundary line is critical. Furthermore, computational efficiency is also important since we need to reduce computation cost so as to save power energy. In this paper, we propose k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) based method to determine the location of a mobile client based on received signal strength (RSS) values. We further use information gain as a feature selection criterion to reduce the estimation time.

A stochastic traffic signal control scheme, based on reinforcement learning, is introduced in the traffic signal control systems due to its powerful adaptability. The RL- based adaptive controller (RAC) can produced appropriate control policy to prevent the traffic network from becoming over- congested. The traditional intersection traffic model is extended to a new mode which taking some real aspects of traffic conditions into account, such as the turning fraction and the lanes scheme. The model is tested on a typical four-legged signalized intersection, and compared to both pre-timed control and full-actuated controller (FAC). Analyses of simulation results using this approach show significant improvement over traditional control, especially for the case of over-saturated traffic demand and special events such as incidents and blockages. Using the RAC model, the total mean delay of each vehicle has been reduced by 22.7% under the heavy demands compared to the FAC control algorithm.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1758-2; POD:978-1-4244-1761-2","10.1109/ROBIO.2007.4522521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4522521","Machine learning;intelligent control;reinforcement learning;traffic model;traffic signal control","Adaptive control;Communication system traffic control;Control systems;Fluctuations;Learning;Nonlinear control systems;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Time varying systems;Traffic control","adaptive control;automated highways;intelligent control;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;road traffic;stochastic systems","ITS;RAC model;RL-based adaptive signal control system;isolated intersections;optimization procedure;reinforcement learning;signalized intersection system;stochastic traffic signal control scheme","","1","","10","","","15-18 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, given a video recording of a talking person, we would like to estimate the 3D shape of the face at each instant and learn a model of facial deformation. Time-varying shape is modeled as a rigid transformation combined with a nonrigid deformation. Reconstruction is ill-posed if arbitrary deformations are allowed, and thus additional assumptions about deformations are required. We first suggest restricting shapes to lie within a low-dimensional subspace and describe estimation algorithms. However, this restriction alone is insufficient to constrain reconstruction. To address these problems, we propose a reconstruction method using a Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis (PPCA) shape model and an estimation algorithm that simultaneously estimates 3D shape and motion for each instant, learns the PPCA model parameters, and robustly fills-in missing data points. We then extend the model to represent temporal dynamics in object shape, allowing the algorithm to robustly handle severe cases of missing data.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70752","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359359","3D/stereo scene analysis;Machine learning;Motion;Shape","","image reconstruction;motion estimation;principal component analysis;probability","hierarchical prior;image reconstruction method;motion estimation algorithm;nonrigid 3D object;probabilistic principal component analysis shape model;shape estimation algorithm;uncalibrated 2D point track","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Statistical;Motion;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","165","1","35","","","May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Not only must the players learn low-level skills, but they must also learn to work together and to adapt to the behaviors of different opponents. Dynamic behaviour learning in the face of adversarial opponents involves a) learning a basic set of strategies, and b) tuning these strategies for the specific opponents involved. Iterative approaches to dynamic learning are often slow for large state spaces, especially since in many dynamic situations, the reward is not obvious immediately, but may need to be temporally apportioned over multiple time epochs. In this work, we construct a reinforcement learning model based on a radial basis function network which may be interpreted as a set of fuzzy rules, and which are capable of real-time online learning. We test this method on the soccer-server domain that has emerged as an important testbed for learning dynamic behaviours. In addition to relatively simple behaviours such as goal scoring, we also learn multi-epoch behaviours such as pass interception in the presence of multiple opponents.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1494-9; POD:978-1-4244-1493-2","10.1109/ICET.2007.4516343","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4516343","Autonomous Agents;Machine Learning;Multiagent Systems;Reinforcement Learning;Robotics","Autonomous agents;Feedforward neural networks;Fuzzy sets;Iterative methods;Machine learning;Neural networks;Radial basis function networks;Robots;State-space methods;System testing","fuzzy set theory;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;radial basis function networks","RoboCup Soccer;dynamic behaviour learning;fuzzy set rules;ideal opponent model;learning strategies;multiagent learning;radial basis function network;reinforcement learning;soccer-server domain","","0","","18","","","12-13 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A disease outbreak causes economic loss to the farmer, through the reduced weight gain of sick cattle and the spread of the infection to other cattle. Livestock disease management is a loss-reduction process, where sick cattle are quarantined and treated as early as possible. Disease detection today, however, still relies on behavioral observation and weekly checkups. There is an obvious opportunity for a real-time sensor platform, coupled with intelligent sensor fusion, to significantly improve on the current system. We report on preliminary experiments in developing just such a sensor-fusion system, focusing on a sensor to detect water intake. ROC analysis shows that this sensor does predict disease in cattle.

However, in many practical applications, unlabeled training examples are readily available, but labeled ones are fairly expensive to obtain. Therefore, semisupervised learning has attracted much attention. Previous research on semisupervised learning mainly focuses on semisupervised classification. Although regression is almost as important as classification, semisupervised regression is largely understudied. In particular, although cotraining is a main paradigm in semisupervised learning, few works has been devoted to cotraining-style semisupervised regression algorithms. In this paper, a cotraining-style semisupervised regression algorithm, that is, COREG, is proposed. This algorithm uses two regressors, each labels the unlabeled data for the other regressor, where the confidence in labeling an unlabeled example is estimated through the amount of reduction in mean squared error over the labeled neighborhood of that example. Analysis and experiments show that COREG can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve regression estimates.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.190644","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4339214","Data mining;Machine learning","Automatic control;Automatic testing;Data mining;Humans;Inspection;Labeling;Machine learning;Partitioning algorithms;Semisupervised learning;Supervised learning","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","COREG;cotraining-style algorithms;semisupervised classification;semisupervised regression;supervised learning","","55","","55","","","Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Training is divided into three phases using all or some of these songs. The test set consists of 10 songs selected from 5 genres which are not included in training. We trained and tested the music classifiers using both TreeQ and LVQ algorithms with varying parameters such as, Number of Codebook (NOC) and pruning thresholds to identify the effects of different parameters and features in the Thai music classification and retrieval. We observed that TreeQ-based experiments yield faster response-times than those of LVQ; and therefore, a TreeQ-based system maybe appropriate for online (real-time) music retrieval tasks. On the other hand, LVQ-based experiments consistently yield better accuracy than those of TreeQ; and therefore, a LVQ-based system may be appropriate in the music classification task since music classification can generally be performed off-line.

This is because a majority of researchers in this field have focused on the synthesis of emotional speech rather than focusing on automating human emotion recognition. Many research groups have focused on how to improve the performance of the classifier they used for emotion recognition, and few work has been done on data pre-processing, such as the extraction and selection of a set of specifying acoustic features instead of using all the possible ones they had in hand. To work with well-selected acoustic features does not mean to delay the whole job, but this will save much time and resources by removing the irrelative information and reducing the high-dimension data calculation. In this paper, we developed an automatic feature selector based on a RF2TREE algorithm and the traditional C4.5 algorithm. RF2TREE applied here helped us to solve the problems that did not have enough data examples. The ensemble learning technique was applied to enlarge the original data set by building a bagged random forest to generate many virtual examples, and then the new data set was used to train a single decision tree, which selects the most efficient features to represent the speech signals for the emotion recognition. Finally, the output of the selector was a set of specifying acoustic features, produced by RF2TREE and a single decision tree.","","POD:0-7695-2841-4","10.1109/ICIS.2007.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276418","Decision Tree;Ensemble;Feature Extraction;Learning;Machine Learning;Random Forest;Twice Learning","Data mining;Decision trees;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Humans;Machine learning;Psychology;Signal processing algorithms;Speech recognition;Speech synthesis","acoustic signal processing;decision trees;emotion recognition;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);signal classification;signal representation;speech processing;speech recognition;speech synthesis","RF2TREE algorithm;acoustic feature extraction;decision tree;emotion recognition;ensemble learning technique;feature selection;random forest;signal classification;speech signal representation;speech synthesis;spoken language processing","","8","","37","","","11-13 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed learning parameter improvement mechanisms have three useful points: the first is that it can calculate the students' effective online learning time; the second is that the portion of a message in discussion section which is strongly related to the learning topics can be extracted; the third is plagiarism in students' homework can be detected easily. Then we feed the derived numeric parameters into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict each learner's performance so as to verify whether they reflect the student's studying behaviors. The results from experiments show that the prediction rate for the SVM classifier can be increased up to 35.7% in average after the inputs to the classifier are ' 'purified'' by the learning parameter improvement mechanisms.

We are interested in helping the overall understanding of the system execution, over and during a precise and finite time. To this end, we model its input/output behavior and how this has changed in the past. There is a double goal in mind: accuracy and interpretability. An inductive algorithm for analyzing finite continuous multivariate time series will be achieved, in which the use of fuzzy logic has been taken into account. The aim of the algorithm is to help us to find changes in a system, as well as to identify the causes of these changes in a linguistic form. The causes will be specified by means of a set of fuzzy transitions between consecutive states, which consist of fuzzy rules that model the system. The method suggested has been applied on a real life case, human walk modeling.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.889891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286973","Fuzzy time-series mining;induction algorithms;machine learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Decision support systems;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Heuristic algorithms;Humans;Machine learning algorithms;Time series analysis","fuzzy control;fuzzy logic;learning (artificial intelligence);multivariable control systems","dynamical systems;finite continuous multivariate time series;fuzzy inductive algorithm;fuzzy logic;machine learning;temporal fuzzy chains","","4","","44","","","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Beyond Parameter Estimation: Extending Biomechanical Modeling by the Explicit Exploration of Model Topology","F. J. Valero-Cuevas; V. V. Anand; A. Saxena; H. Lipson","Southern California Univ., Los Angeles","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","20071022","2007","54","11","1951","1964","Selecting a model topology that realistically predicts biomechanical function remains an unsolved problem. Today's dominant modeling approach is to replicate experimental input/output data by performing parameter estimation on an assumed topology. In contrast, we propose that modeling some complex biomechanical systems requires the explicit and simultaneous exploration of model topology (i.e., the type, number, and organization of physics-based functional building blocks) and parameter values. In this paper, we use the example of modeling the notoriously complex tendon networks of the fingers to present three critical advances towards the goal of implementing this extended modeling paradigm. First, we describe a novel computational environment to perform quasi-static simulations of arbitrary topologies of elastic structures undergoing large deformations. Second, we use this form of simulation to show that the assumed topology for the tendon network of a finger plays an important role in the propagation of tension to the finger joints. Third, we demonstrate the use of a novel inference algorithm that simultaneously explores the topology and parameter values for hidden synthetic tendon networks. We conclude by discussing critical issues of observability, separability, and uniqueness of topological features inferred from input/output data, and outline the challenges that need to be overcome to apply this novel modeling paradigm to extract causal models in real anatomical systems.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2007.906494","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352068","Bioinformatics;biomechanical model;hand;machine learning","Computational modeling;Data mining;Deformable models;Fingers;Inference algorithms;Network topology;Observability;Parameter estimation;Predictive models;Tendons","biomechanics","biomechanical modeling;causal models;elastic structures;finger joints;model topology;parameter estimation;physics-based functional building blocks;quasistatic simulations;synthetic tendon networks","Algorithms;Biomechanics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Joints;Models, Biological;Movement;Muscle Contraction;Muscle, Skeletal","14","","45","","","Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Different sets of spectral, geometric and contextual (meteo-oceanographic and location) features of selected low backscatter patches were evaluated. Machine learning procedures (neural networks, decision trees and support vector machines) were used to induce classifiers to differentiate between seven classes, belonging to two categories. The classification procedure involves two steps: first the features area classified in one of two categories - oil spill or meteo- oceanographic phenomena. In the second step, the identification of tree classes of oil spills and four classes of meteo- oceanographic phenomena is done. The oil spill related classes are associated to operational exploration and production spills, ship releases and others. The meteo-oceanographic phenomena include biogenic oils and/or upwellings, algae blooms, low wind areas and rain cells. The models induced by support vector machines and neural networks achieved good results, allowing the operational implementation of the proposed procedures.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4422946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4422946","Synthetic aperture radar;classification;machine learning;ocean features detection;oil spill","Backscatter;Event detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Petroleum;Radar detection;Radar imaging;Sea measurements;Support vector machines;Testing","backscatter;decision trees;feature extraction;geophysics computing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;oceanographic regions;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","Brazilian coast;RADARSAT-1 images;algae blooms;automatic recognition;backscatter patches;coastal environmental events;decision trees;features classification;machine learning;meteooceanographic phenomena;neural networks;oceanic environmental events;oil spill;orbital radars;support vector machines","","1","","8","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a new machine-learning method for the prediction of putative regulatory associations from expression data which exhibit properties never or only partially addressed by other techniques recently published. The method was tested on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression data set. The results were statistically validated and compared with the relationships inferred by two machine-learning approaches to GRN prediction. Furthermore, the resulting predictions were assessed using domain knowledge. The proposed algorithm may be able to accurately predict relevant biological associations between genes. One of the most relevant features of this new method is the prediction of adaptive regulation thresholds for the discretization of gene expression values, which is required prior to the rule association learning process. Moreover, an important advantage consists of its low computational cost to infer association rules. The proposed system may significantly support exploratory large-scale studies of automated identification of potentially relevant gene expression associations.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/tcbb.2007.1049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359844","combinatorial optimization;decision trees;gene expression data;genetic regulatory networks;machine-learning","Association rules;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Computational efficiency;Computer networks;Design methodology;Gene expression;Large scale integration;Predictive models;Testing","biology computing;data mining;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence)","GRN;adaptive regulation threshold;association rules;combinatorial optimization learning;gene regulatory networks;machine-learning method;saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression data set","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computational Biology;Fungal Proteins;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes, Fungal;Models, Statistical;Models, Theoretical;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Saccharomyces cerevisiae","12","","50","","","Oct.-Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, these decisions (e.g., resource allocation, job assignment, etc.) may be complex and thus difficult to model. A few approaches based on Artificial Intelligence methods have already been proposed. Unfortunately, these approaches need explicit knowledge about the decision logic, which is often difficult to obtain or formalize. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an approach that places the decision maker “in situ”. For this, a VIS is used. The real-time decisions taken by the decision-maker are collected and processed by a machine learning program.

For each amino acid that contacts with DNA, we attempt to predict the type of bases (purines or pyrimidines) that it contacts. We extract 8 structural and physicochemical features from proteins and use a bottom-up approach to search for the combination of features that can be used to predict the specificity of amino acid-base contacts. In the end, 4 features are selected. Using these features, a support vector machine method can achieve 67.1% accuracy with 0.329 MCC in predicting the type of base (purines or pyrimidines) that an amino acid contacts.

However, these methods often miscarry in the case of the absence of similar sequences or poor similarity among proteins. Therefore, many researchers have been developing alternative approaches that assign function from protein features without consideration of sequence similarity. In this paper, we propose a method of sequence-driven feature extraction and enzyme functional classification using only the features of protein sequence, excluding predicted secondary structures and annotation information of protein databases.

Our system explores a space of amplitude and frequency values, using q-learning to learn the wave which optimally satisfies a human tutor. To estimate tutor feedback in real-time, we first segment speech from ambient noise using a maximum-likelihood voice-activation detector. We then use a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier, with A=3, over 15 prosodic features, to estimate a binary approval/disapproval feedback signal from segmented utterances. Both our voice-activation detector and prosody classifier are trained on the speech of the individual tutor. We show that our system learns the tutor's desired wave, over the course of a sequence of trial-feedback cycles.
