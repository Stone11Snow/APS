abstract = {"Abstract Deep learning with a convolutional neural network (CNN) has been proved to be very effective in feature extraction and representation of images. For image classification problems, this work aims at exploring the capability of extreme learning machine on high-level deep features of images. Additionally, motivated by the biological learning mechanism of ELM, in this paper, an adaptive extreme learning machine (AELM) method is proposed for handling cross-task (domain) learning problems, without loss of its nature of randomization and high efficiency. The proposed \{AELM\} is an extension of \{ELM\} from single task to cross task learning, by introducing a new error term and Laplacian graph based manifold regularization term in objective function. We have discussed the nearest neighbor, support vector machines and extreme learning machines for image classification under deep convolutional activation feature representation. Specifically, we adopt 4 benchmark object recognition datasets from multiple sources with domain bias for evaluating different classifiers. The deep features of the object dataset are obtained by a well-trained \{CNN\} with five convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers on ImageNet. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed \{AELM\} is comparable and effective in single and multiple domains based recognition tasks. "}

In this paper, we propose a new Instance Cloned Extreme Learning Machine (IC-ELM for short) which can handle numerous different classification problems. IC-ELM uses an instance cloning method to balance the input data’s distribution and extend the training data set, which alleviates the overfitting issue and enhances the testing classification accuracy.

Then, experiments are conducted for comparing the performances of four popular feature selection algorithms (document frequency, \{CHI\} statistics, information gain and gain ratio) and five popular machine learning algorithms (decision tree, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, radial basis function neural network and K-nearest neighbor) in multi-class sentiment classification. The experiments are conducted on three public datasets which include twelve data subsets, and 10-fold cross validation is used to obtain the classification accuracy concerning each combination of feature selection algorithm, machine learning algorithm, feature set size and data subset. Based on the obtained 3600 classification accuracies (4 feature selection algorithms × 5 machine learning algorithms × 15 feature set sizes × 12 data subsets), the average classification accuracy of each algorithm is calculated, and the Wilcoxon test is used to verify the existence of significant difference between different algorithms in multi-class sentiment classification. The results show that, in terms of classification accuracy, gain ratio performs best among the four feature selection algorithms and support vector machine performs best among the five machine learning algorithms.

abstract = {"Abstract To compact the architecture of extreme learning machine (ELM), two incremental learning algorithms are proposed in this paper. The previous incremental learning algorithms for \{ELM\} recruit hidden nodes randomly, which is equivalent to implementing a random selection from a candidate set of infinite size. Hence, it is impossible to recruit good hidden nodes, and thus it usually requires more hidden nodes than traditional neural networks to achieve matched performance. To improve the quality of the hidden nodes recruited, an incremental learning algorithm for \{ELM\} is presented based on Gram--Schmidt process (GSI-ELM), which recruits the best hidden node from a random subset of fixed size via defining an evaluating criterion at each learning step. However, the “nesting effect” exists in the GSI-ELM, that is to say, the hidden nodes once recruited by GSI-ELM can not be later discarded. To treat this “nesting problem”, the improved GSI-ELM (IGSI-ELM) is generated with an elimination mechanism. At each learning step IGSI-ELM eliminates the worst hidden node from the already-recruited group if it is not the newly-recruited one. Finally, to verify the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed algorithms, i.e. GSI-ELM and IGSI-ELM, in this paper, experiments on regression and classification benchmark data sets are investigated.

We then apply the proposed machine learning approach to static, dynamic, and static-dynamic caching.

Next, the final landslide susceptibility map is produced using the \{ELM\} model based on the recorded landslides and reasonable non-landslide grid cells. The single \{ELM\} model which selects the non-landslide grid cells randomly, and the \{SOM\} network-based \{SVM\} model are used for comparisons. It is concluded that the SOM-ELM model possesses higher success and prediction rates than the single \{ELM\} and SOM-SVM models, and the \{ELM\} has a considerably higher prediction efficiency than the SVM.

In this research, we present an automatic \{DSS\} detection method by combining interest region extraction and machine learning techniques. The interest region extraction combines gradient and regional grayscale information. Moreover, a novel recognition strategy is proposed that takes the normalized minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) of the extracted regions to calculate the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) feature and train a \{DSS\} classifier using the Adaboost machine learning algorithm. Comparative experiments using five different feature descriptors and three different machine learning algorithms show the superiority of the proposed method. Experimental results utilizing 888 extracted region samples from 28 HiRISE images show that the overall detection accuracy of our proposed method is 92.4%, with a true positive rate of 79.1% and false positive rate of 3.7%, which in particular indicates great performance of the method at eliminating non-DSS regions.

The objective of the \{OMG\} is to enable mobile sensing as a scalable approach to realize the comfort and energy savings potential of data-driven thermal management using personalized comfort models. In contrast to the universal application of static comfort criteria, data-driven models have the potential to enable flexible and continuous interpretation of thermal comfort, allowing for more personalized control of the thermal environment and minimization of the energy wasted by overheating and overcooling. Novel machine-learning algorithms are applied to synthesize subjective and physical thermal measurements into personalized comfort models which can be interpreted to determine optimal temperature setpoints based on energy and comfort goals. The feasibility of machine learning algorithms to generate useful personalized occupant comfort profiles is examined using field data from four test sites (N = 45 occupants total). The findings demonstrate that it is possible to model the thermal preferences of occupants at both the individual and zone level with data collected over a relatively small time period (2-weeks). Application of occupant-driven comfort models in annual energy simulations shows that thermal management informed by occupant feedback has the potential for significant energy savings. "}

However, the online measure device is extremely expensive, and these devices are hard to protect. Meanwhile, there is a delay for these online measure devices. Therefore, the soft sensor technology plays a vital role in measuring the key process variables. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an efficient and simple single layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs) to building an exact soft sensor model. However, unsuitable selected hidden nodes and random parameters will greatly affect the performance of the ELM. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Self-Organizing Extreme Learning Machine (SOELM) algorithm constructed by the biological neuron-glia interaction principle to solve the issue of the ELM. Firstly, the weights between input layer nodes and the \{CNS\} are tuned iteratively by the Hebbian learning rule. Then the network structure is adjusted self-organizing by Mutual Information (MI) among different structures of networks. Secondly, the weights between the \{CNS\} and output layer nodes are obtained by the ELM. The experimental results based on different \{UCI\} data sets prove that the \{SOELM\} has a better generalization capability and stability than that of the ELM.

To solve these two problems, random forests-based extreme learning machine ensemble model and a novel multi-regime approach are proposed respectively, and these two approaches can be integrated to achieve better performance. First, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is used in the proposed model because of its efficiency. Then the regularized \{ELM\} and ensemble learning strategy are used to improve generalization performance and prediction accuracy. The bootstrap sampling technique is used to generate training sample sets for multiple base-level \{ELM\} models, and then the random forests (RF) model is used as the combiner to aggregate these \{ELM\} models to achieve more accurate and stable performance. Next, based on the specific properties of turbofan engine time series, a multi-regime approach is proposed to handle it. Regimes are first separated, then the proposed RF-based \{ELM\} ensemble model is used to learn models of all regimes, individually, and last, all the learned regime models are aggregated to predict performance parameter at the future timestamp.

Identifying patients at the highest risk for future suicide attempts remains a complex problem for psychiatric interventions. Machine learning models allow for the integration of many risk factors in order to build an algorithm that predicts which patients are likely to attempt suicide. Currently it is unclear how to integrate previously identified risk factors into a clinically relevant predictive tool to estimate the probability of a patient with schizophrenia for attempting suicide. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional assessment on a sample of 345 participants diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Suicide attempters and non-attempters were clearly identified using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and the Beck Suicide Ideation Scale (BSS). We developed four classification algorithms using a regularized regression, random forest, elastic net and support vector machine models with sociocultural and clinical variables as features to train the models. Results All classification models performed similarly in identifying suicide attempters and non-attempters. Our regularized logistic regression model demonstrated an accuracy of 67% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71, while the random forest model demonstrated 66% accuracy and an \{AUC\} of 0.67.

How to mining the interesting knowledge and patterns from continuous data stream becomes a problem which we have to solve. Different from conventional classification algorithms, data stream classification algorithms have to adjust their classification models with the change of data stream because of concept drift. However, conventional classification models will keep stable once models are trained. To solve the problem, a dynamic extreme learning machine for data stream classification (DELM) is proposed. \{DELM\} utilizes online learning mechanism to train \{ELM\} as basic classifier and trains a double hidden layer structure to improve the performance of ELM. When an alert about concept drift is set, more hidden layer nodes are added into \{ELM\} to improve the generalization ability of classifier. If the value measuring concept drift reaches the upper limit or the accuracy of \{ELM\} is in a low level, the current classifier will be deleted, and the algorithm will use new data to train a new classifier so as to learn new concept. The experimental results showed \{DELM\} could improve the accuracy of classification result, and can adapt to new concept in a short time. "}

While advances in machine learning have led to numerous powerful classifiers, their usefulness for modeling travel mode choice remains largely unexplored. Using extensive Dutch travel diary data from the years 2010 to 2012, enriched with variables on the built and natural environment as well as on weather conditions, this study compares the predictive performance of seven selected machine learning classifiers for travel mode choice analysis and makes recommendations for model selection. In addition, it addresses the importance of different variables and how they relate to different travel modes. The results show that random forest performs significantly better than any other of the investigated classifiers, including the commonly used multinomial logit model. While trip distance is found to be the most important variable, the importance of the other variables varies with classifiers and travel modes. The importance of the meteorological variables is highest for support vector machine, while temperature is particularly important for predicting bicycle and public transport trips. The results suggest that the analysis of variable importance with respect to the different classifiers and travel modes is essential for a better understanding and effective modeling of people’s travel behavior.

Recent studies have focused on improving the accuracy of \{BCP\} by including all of the features, neglecting to determine the best performing subset of features. However, for some problems, the number of features may reach thousands, which will cause too much computation power to be consumed during the feature evaluation and classification phases, also possibly reducing the accuracy of the results. Therefore, selecting the minimum number of features while preserving and/or increasing the accuracy of the results at a high level becomes an important issue for achieving fast and accurate binary classification. Our multiobjective evolutionary algorithm includes two phases, \{FSS\} using a \{GA\} and applying \{ML\} techniques for the BCP. Since exhaustively investigating all of the feature subsets is intractable, a \{GA\} is preferred for the first phase of the algorithm for intelligently detecting the most appropriate feature subset. The \{GA\} uses multiobjective crossover and mutation operators to improve a population of individuals (each representing a selected feature subset) and obtain (near-) optimal solutions through generations. In the second phase of the algorithms, the fitness of the selected subset is decided by using state-of-the-art \{ML\} techniques; Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machine, K-means, and Affinity Propagation. The performance of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (and the \{ML\} techniques) is evaluated with comprehensive experiments and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, Greedy Search, Particle Swarm Optimization, Tabu Search, and Scatter Search. The proposed algorithm was observed to be robust and it performed better than the existing methods on most of the datasets. "}

Methods The study subjects consisted of 25 drug-free female \{MDD\} patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. First, quantitative serum proteome profiles were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using pooled serum samples from 10 patients and 10 controls. Next, candidate proteins were quantified with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in 50 subjects. We also analyzed 22 linear and nonlinear \{HRV\} parameters in 50 subjects. Finally, we identified a combined biomarker panel consisting of proteins and \{HRV\} indexes using a support vector machine with recursive feature elimination. Results A separation between \{MDD\} and control groups was achieved using five parameters (apolipoprotein B, group-specific component, ceruloplasmin, RMSSD, and SampEn) at 80.1% classification accuracy. A combination of \{HRV\} and proteomic data achieved better classification accuracy. Conclusions A high classification accuracy can be achieved by combining multimodal information from heart rate dynamics and serum proteomics in MDD.

Sample size is especially important in the case of highly heterogeneous disorders such as schizophrenia, where machine learning models built on relatively low numbers of subjects may suffer from poor generalizability. Via multicenter studies and consortium initiatives researchers have tried to solve this problem by combining data sets from multiple sites. The necessary sharing of (raw) data is, however, often hindered by legal and ethical issues. Moreover, in the case of very large samples, the computational complexity might become too large. The solution to this problem could be distributed learning. In this paper we investigated the possibility to create a meta-model by combining support vector machines (SVM) classifiers trained on the local datasets, without the need for sharing medical images or any other personal data. Validation was done in a 4-center setup comprising of 480 first-episode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls in total. We built \{SVM\} models to separate patients from controls based on three different kinds of imaging features derived from structural \{MRI\} scans, and compared models built on the joint multicenter data to the meta-models. The results showed that the combined meta-model had high similarity to the model built on all data pooled together and comparable classification performance on all three imaging features. Both similarity and performance was superior to that of the local models. We conclude that combining models is thus a viable alternative that facilitates data sharing and creating bigger and more informative models. "}

These tests, however, require a high degree of collaboration and maximal effort on the part of the patient. There is agreement in the literature that there is a demand of research into new technologies to improve non-invasive testing of lung function. The purpose of this study was to develop automatic classifiers to simplify the clinical use and to increase the accuracy of the forced oscillation technique (FOT) in the diagnosis of airway obstruction in patients with asthma. Methods The data consisted of \{FOT\} parameters obtained from 75 volunteers (39 with obstruction and 36 without). Different supervised machine learning (ML) techniques were investigated, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), AdaBoost with decision trees (ADAB) and feature-based dissimilarity space classifier (FDSC). Results The first part of this study showed that the best \{FOT\} parameter was the resonance frequency (AUC = 0.81), which indicates moderate accuracy (0.70–0.90). In the second part of this study, the use of the cited \{ML\} techniques was investigated. All the classifiers improved the diagnostic accuracy. Notably, \{ADAB\} and \{KNN\} were very close to achieving high accuracy (AUC = 0.88 and 0.89, respectively). Experiments including the cross products of the \{FOT\} parameters showed that all the classifiers improved the diagnosis accuracy and \{KNN\} was able to reach a higher accuracy range (AUC = 0.91). Conclusions Machine learning classifiers can help in the diagnosis of airway obstruction in asthma patients, and they can assist clinicians in airway obstruction identification. "}

Therefore, this paper proposes a predictive modeling approach based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated extreme learning machine (ELM) (AHP-ELM). The proposed approach utilizes the \{AHP\} model to obtain the effective process characteristic information (PCIs). Compared with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated traditional artificial neural network (ANN) approach, the AHP-ELM prediction model is effectively verified by executing a linear comparison between all \{PCIs\} and the effective \{PCIs\} through daily inspection data source from the supervision and inspection department repository of China quality supervision system. Finally, the \{PCIs\} and the prediction value are obtained to provide more reliable food information and identification of potentially emerging food safety issues. The proposed method is applied to the food safety early warning and monitoring system in China. The result shows that the proposed model is effective and feasible in processing the complex food inspection data. Meanwhile, it can help to improve the quality of food products, ensure food safety and reduce the risk of food safety. "}

Identifying areas prone to salt accumulation by means of geomorphometry (i.e. terrain analyses using digital elevation models (DEMs)) can potentially save time and costs. This study evaluated the extent to which \{DEM\} derivatives and machine learning (ML) algorithms (k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine, decision tree (DT) and random forest) can be used for predicting the location and extent of salt-affected areas within the Vaalharts and Breede River irrigation schemes of South Africa. In accordance with local management policies, salt-affected areas were defined as regions with soil electrical conductivity (EC) values &gt; 4 dS/m. Two DEMs, namely the one-arch second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) \{DEM\} and a photogrammetrically-extracted digital surface model (DSM), were used for deriving the derivatives. Wetness indices as well as hydrological and morphometric terrain analysis techniques were used to generate predictive variables. For comparative purposes, the predictive variables were also used as input to regression modelling and kriging with external drift (KED). Thresholds were applied to the regression models and \{KED\} results to obtain a binary classification. \{EC\} values based on in situ soil samples were used for model development, classifier training and accuracy assessment. The results show that \{KED\} achieved the highest overall accuracy (OA) in Vaalharts (79.6%), whereas \{KED\} and \{ML\} (DT) showed the most promise in the Breede River (75%). The findings suggest that the use of elevation data and its derivatives as input to geostatistics and \{ML\} holds much potential for monitoring salt accumulation in irrigated areas, particularly for simulating sub-surface conditions. More work is needed to investigate the potential of using \{ML\} and DEM-derivatives, along with other geospatial datasets such as satellite imagery (that have been shown to be effective for monitoring surface conditions), for the operational modelling of salt accumulation in large irrigation schemes.

A challenge for empirically assessing this hypothesis is that the impact of mixing may depend on various socio-demographic characteristics of the neighborhood and takes place in a complex fashion that cannot be appropriately handled by traditional statistical analytical approaches. We utilize a rarely used, innovative estimation technique—kernel regularized least squares—that allows for nonparametric estimation of the relationship between various neighborhood characteristics in 2000 and the change in average household income in the neighborhood from 2000 to 2010. The results demonstrate that the relationships between average income growth and both income mixing and racial/ethnic mixing are contingent upon several neighborhood socio-demographic “ingredients”. For example, racial mixing is positively associated with average income over time when it occurs in neighborhoods with a high percentage of Latinos or immigrants, high population density, or high housing age mixing. Income mixing is associated with worsening average household income in neighborhoods with more poverty, unemployment, immigrants, or population density. It appears that considering the broader characteristics of the neighborhood is important for understanding economic dynamism. "}

As this is a time-consuming task, automatic processes are required. A method using signal processing and machine learning models is presented. Using signal processing techniques, after a first step of signal conditioning, abrupt frequency changes in two \{EEG\} derivations and amplitude events in one submental electromyogram are identified. These events are grouped if they occur at the same time, using the epoch segmentation for that purpose. A set of features (that includes Hjorth’s Parameters and the Sleep Stage), is extracted from each group and used as input for several machine learning models. With a first dataset of 20 \{PSG\} recordings, six models are configured and compared: Fisher’s Linear Discriminant, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Classification Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes. The best models, in terms of the classification error and the capabilities to detect \{EEG\} arousals, were used to build two different combined approaches. The first approach follows the Shortliffe and Buchanan’s certainty factors model and the second follows a linear combination. Conducting experiments on 26 \{PSG\} recordings, a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.89 with an error of 0.12 was achieved using the first approach, and a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.88 with an error of 0.13 was achieved using the second approach. Both approaches improved the performance over the individual models. These results were also compared to two well-known ensemble methods: Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbor Ensemble. Again, the combined approaches showed the best performance. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Forecasting the output power of solar systems is required for the good operation of the power grid or for the optimal management of the energy fluxes occurring into the solar system. Before forecasting the solar systems output, it is essential to focus the prediction on the solar irradiance. The global solar radiation forecasting can be performed by several methods; the two big categories are the cloud imagery combined with physical models, and the machine learning models. In this context, the objective of this paper is to give an overview of forecasting methods of solar irradiation using machine learning approaches. Although, a lot of papers describes methodologies like neural networks or support vector regression, it will be shown that other methods (regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting and many others) begin to be used in this context of prediction. The performance ranking of such methods is complicated due to the diversity of the data set, time step, forecasting horizon, set up and performance indicators. Overall, the error of prediction is quite equivalent. To improve the prediction performance some authors proposed the use of hybrid models or to use an ensemble forecast approach. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Online product reviews have been shown to be a viable source of information for helping customers make informed purchasing decisions. In many cases, users of online shopping platforms have the ability to rate products on a numerical scale, and also provide textual feedback pertaining to a purchased product. Beyond using online product review platforms as customer decision support systems, this information rich data source could also aid designers seeking to increase the chances of their products being successful in the market through a deeper understanding of market needs. However, the increasing size and complexity of products on the market makes manual analysis of such data challenging. Information obtained from such sources, if not mined correctly, risks misrepresenting a product's true success/failure (e.g., a customer leaves a one star rating because of the slow shipping service of a product, not necessarily that he/she dislikes the product). The objective of this paper is three fold: i) to propose a machine learning approach that disambiguates online customer review feedback by classifying them into one of three direct product characteristics (i.e., form, function or behavior) and two indirect product characteristics (i.e., service and other), ii) to discover the machine learning algorithm that yields the highest and most generalizable results in achieving objective i) and iii) to quantify the correlation between product ratings and direct and indirect product characteristics. A case study involving review data for products mined from e-commerce websites is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. A multilayered (i.e., k-fold and leave one out) validation approach is presented to explore the generalizability of the proposed method. The resulting machine learning model achieved classification accuracies of 82.44% for within product classification, 80.84% for across product classification, 79.03% for across product type classification and 80.64% for across product domain classification. Furthermore, it was determined that the form of a product had the highest Pearson Correlation Coefficient relating to a product's star rating, with a value of 0.934. The scientific contributions of this work have the potential to transform the manner in which both product designers and customers incorporate product reviews into their decision making processes by quantifying the relationship between product reviews and product characteristics.

The use of long-range climate forecast data was compared to the use of climatological data for periods with no observation data. Machine learning models utilizing drought-related variables based on remote sensing data were compared to the spatial interpolation of Kriging. Two performance measures were used; one is producer’s drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in extreme, severe, and moderate drought classes over the total number of samples in those classes, and the other is user’s drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in drought classes over the total number of samples classified to those classes. One of the machine learning models, extremely randomized trees, performed the best in most cases in terms of producer’s accuracy reaching up to 64%, while spatial interpolation performed better in terms of user’s accuracy up to 44%. The contribution of long-range climate forecast data was not significant under the conditions used in this study, but further improvement is expected if forecast skill is improved or a more sophisticated downscaling method is used. Simulated decreases of forecast error in precipitation and mean temperature were tested: the simulated decrease of forecast error in precipitation improves drought forecast while the decrease of forecast error in mean temperature does not contribute much. Although there is still some room for improvement, the developed model can be used for drought-related decision making in ungauged areas. "}

The advantage of the visual approach is in opportunity to substitute some complex cognitive tasks by easier perceptual tasks. However for cognitive tasks such as financial investment decision making this opportunity faces the challenge that financial data are abstract multidimensional and multivariate, i.e., outside of traditional visual perception in 2D or 3D world. This paper presents an approach to find an investment strategy based on pattern discovery in multidimensional space of specifically prepared time series. Visualization based on the lossless Collocated Paired Coordinates (CPC) plays an important role in this approach for building the criteria in the multidimensional space for finding an efficient investment strategy. Criteria generated with the \{CPC\} approach allow reducing/compressing space using simple directed graphs with beginnings and the ends located in different time points. The dedicated subspaces constructed for time series include characteristics such as Bollinger Band, difference between moving averages, changes in volume etc. Extensive simulation studies have been performed in learning/testing context. Effective relations were found for one-hour \{EURUSD\} pair for recent and historical data. Also the method has been explored for one-day \{EURUSD\} time series n 2D and 3D visualization spaces. The main positive result is finding the effective split of a normalized 3D space on 4x4x4 cubes in the visualization space that leads to a profitable investment decision (long, short position or nothing). The strategy is ready for implementation in algotrading mode. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Exposure to erythemally-effective solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that contributes to malignant keratinocyte cancers and associated health-risk is best mitigated through innovative decision-support systems, with global solar \{UV\} index (UVI) forecast necessary to inform real-time sun-protection behaviour recommendations. It follows that the \{UVI\} forecasting models are useful tools for such decision-making. In this study, a model for computationally-efficient data-driven forecasting of diffuse and global very short-term reactive (VSTR) (10-min lead-time) UVI, enhanced by drawing on the solar zenith angle ( θ s ) data, was developed using an extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. An \{ELM\} algorithm typically serves to address complex and ill-defined forecasting problems. \{UV\} spectroradiometer situated in Toowoomba, Australia measured daily cycles (0500–1700 h) of \{UVI\} over the austral summer period. After trialling activations functions based on sine, hard limit, logarithmic and tangent sigmoid and triangular and radial basis networks for best results, an optimal \{ELM\} architecture utilising logarithmic sigmoid equation in hidden layer, with lagged combinations of θ s as the predictor data was developed. ELM’s performance was evaluated using statistical metrics: correlation coefficient (r), Willmott’s Index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ( E \{NS\} ), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) between observed and forecasted UVI. Using these metrics, the \{ELM\} model’s performance was compared to that of existing methods: multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), \{M5\} Model Tree, and a semi-empirical (Pro6UV) clear sky model. Based on \{RMSE\} and \{MAE\} values, the \{ELM\} model (0.255, 0.346, respectively) outperformed the \{MARS\} (0.310, 0.438) and \{M5\} Model Tree (0.346, 0.466) models. Concurring with these metrics, the Willmott’s Index for the ELM, \{MARS\} and \{M5\} Model Tree models were 0.966, 0.942 and 0.934, respectively. About 57% of the \{ELM\} model’s absolute errors were small in magnitude (±0.25), whereas the \{MARS\} and \{M5\} Model Tree models generated 53% and 48% of such errors, respectively, indicating the latter models’ errors to be distributed in larger magnitude error range. In terms of peak global \{UVI\} forecasting, with half the level of error, the \{ELM\} model outperformed \{MARS\} and \{M5\} Model Tree. A comparison of the magnitude of hourly-cumulated errors of 10-min lead time forecasts for diffuse and global \{UVI\} highlighted \{ELM\} model’s greater accuracy compared to MARS, \{M5\} Model Tree or Pro6UV models. This confirmed the versatility of an \{ELM\} model drawing on θ s data for \{VSTR\} forecasting of \{UVI\} at near real-time horizon. When applied to the goal of enhancing expert systems, ELM-based accurate forecasts capable of reacting quickly to measured conditions can enhance real-time exposure advice for the public, mitigating the potential for solar UV-exposure-related disease.

Researchers endeavor to discover the traces of malicious apps using network traffic analysis. In this study, we combine network traffic analysis with machine learning methods to identify malicious network behavior, and eventually to detect malicious apps. However, most network traffic generated by malicious apps is benign, while only a small portion of traffic is malicious, leading to an imbalanced data problem when the traffic model skews towards modeling the benign traffic. To address this problem, we introduce imbalanced classification methods, including the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) + support vector machine (SVM), \{SVM\} cost-sensitive (SVMCS), and C4.5 cost-sensitive (C4.5CS) methods. However, when the imbalance rate reaches a certain threshold, the performance of common imbalanced classification algorithms degrades significantly. To avoid performance degradation, we propose to use the imbalanced data gravitation-based classification (IDGC) algorithm to classify imbalanced data. Moreover, we develop a simplex imbalanced data gravitation classification (S-IDGC) model to further reduce the time costs of \{IDGC\} without sacrificing the classification performance. In addition, we propose a machine learning based comparative benchmark prototype system, which provides users with substantial autonomy, such as multiple choices of the desired classifiers or traffic features. Using this prototype system, users can compare the detection performance of different classification algorithms on the same data set, as well as the performance of a specific classification algorithm on multiple data sets.

To this end we systematically evaluate properties of reflectance spectra and find that they are surprisingly similar over a wide range of species. We assessed the performance of a wide range of machine learning methods and selected recursive feature elimination on un-transformed spectra followed by partial least squares regression as the preferred algorithm that yielded the highest predictive power. Learning curves of this algorithm suggest optimal, species-specific sample sizes. Using the Brassica relative Moricandia, we evaluate model transferability between species and find that cross-species performance cannot be predicted from phylogenetic proximity. The final intra-species models predict crop photosynthetic capacity with high accuracy. Based on the estimated model accuracy, we simulated the models’ use in selective breeding experiments, showing that high-throughput photosynthetic phenotyping using our method has the potential to greatly improve breeding success. In summary, leaf reflectance phenotyping is an efficient method for the improvement of crop photosynthetic capacity. "}

Recently, advanced computing and statistical technologies, such as Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms, were introduced to complement the control performance for optimal energy use in building thermal systems. However, most schemes were developed to control fuel use or fan motor speed in a plant or a system, and showed some disadvantages to immediately respond to sensitive changes in thermal demands for a zone scaled level. This paper introduces heating energy models capable of controlling the amount of supply air and its temperature simultaneously, and the \{FIS\} and \{ANN\} algorithms are developed to control the optimal supply air conditions for a heating season. Both the \{FIS\} and \{ANN\} models are compared to thermostat controllers with 4-step dead-band setups from normal to sensitive levels. The sum of errors, caused by the difference between desired set-point and controlled room temperatures, and the amount of energy supply are used to define control precision and energy efficiency of the control models. From the simulation results, the machine-learning based \{ANN\} controller averagely reduces control errors by 88% and mitigates increases in energy consumption by 2% in comparison with thermostat on/off controllers. The control system can be effective when various sensitive settings are required as a type of buildings and rooms without an excessive increase in energy use. "}

For binary classification problem, traditional \{ELM\} learns only one hyperplane to separate different classes in the feature space.

Specifically, \{TELM\} first utilizes the random feature mapping mechanism to construct the feature space, and then two nonparallel separating hyperplanes are learned for the final classification. For each hyperplane, \{TELM\} jointly minimizes its distance to one class and requires it to be far away from the other class. \{TELM\} incorporates the idea of twin support vector machine (TSVM) into the basic framework of ELM, thus \{TELM\} could have the advantages of the both algorithms. Moreover, compared to TSVM, \{TELM\} has fewer optimization constraint variables but with better classification performance. We also introduce a successive over-relaxation technique to speed up the training of our algorithm. Comprehensive experimental results on a large number of datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TELM. "}

However, the majority of these algorithms assume that the underlying data distribution does not change over time. Previous work has demonstrated evidence of the negative impact of three main temporal effects in representative datasets textual datasets, reflected by variations observed over time in the class distribution, in the pairwise class similarities and in the relationships between terms and classes [1]. In order to minimize the impact of temporal effects in \{ADC\} algorithms, we have previously introduced the notion of a temporal weighting function (TWF), which reflects the varying nature of textual datasets. We have also proposed a procedure to derive the TWF’s expression and parameters. However, the derivation of the \{TWF\} requires the running of explicit and complex statistical tests, which are very cumbersome or can not even be run in several cases. In this article, we propose a machine learning methodology to automatically learn the \{TWF\} without the need to perform any statistical tests. We also propose new strategies to incorporate the \{TWF\} into \{ADC\} algorithms, which we call temporally-aware classifiers. Experiments showed that the fully-automated temporally-aware classifiers achieved significant gains (up to 17%) when compared to their non-temporal counterparts, even outperforming some state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., SVM) in most cases, with large reductions in execution time.

abstract = {"Abstract Several code smells detection tools have been developed providing different results, because smells can be subjectively interpreted and hence detected in different ways. Machine learning techniques have been used for different topics in software engineering, e.g., design pattern detection, code smell detection, bug prediction, recommending systems. In this paper, we focus our attention on the classification of code smell severity through the use of machine learning techniques in different experiments. The severity of code smells is an important factor to take into consideration when reporting code smell detection results, since it allows the prioritization of refactoring efforts. In fact, code smells with high severity can be particularly large and complex, and create larger issues to the maintainability of software a system. In our experiments, we apply several machine learning models, spanning from multinomial classification to regression, plus a method to apply binary classifiers for ordinal classification. In fact, we model code smell severity as an ordinal variable. We take the baseline models from previous work, where we applied binary classification models for code smell detection with good results. We report and compare the performance of the models according to their accuracy and four different performance measures used for the evaluation of ordinal classification techniques. From our results, while the accuracy of the classification of severity is not high as in the binary classification of absence or presence of code smells, the ranking correlation of the actual and predicted severity for the best models reaches 0.88–0.96, measured through Spearman’s ρ.

abstract = {"Abstract There has been intensive research from academics and practitioners regarding models for predicting bankruptcy and default events, for credit risk management. Seminal academic research has evaluated bankruptcy using traditional statistics techniques (e.g. discriminant analysis and logistic regression) and early artificial intelligence models (e.g. artificial neural networks). In this study, we test machine learning models (support vector machines, bagging, boosting, and random forest) to predict bankruptcy one year prior to the event, and compare their performance with results from discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks. We use data from 1985 to 2013 on North American firms, integrating information from the Salomon Center database and Compustat, analysing more than 10,000 firm-year observations. The key insight of the study is a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy using machine learning techniques especially when, in addition to the original Altman’s Z-score variables, we include six complementary financial indicators. Based on Carton and Hofer (2006), we use new variables, such as the operating margin, change in return-on-equity, change in price-to-book, and growth measures related to assets, sales, and number of employees, as predictive variables. Machine learning models show, on average, approximately 10% more accuracy in relation to traditional models. Comparing the best models, with all predictive variables, the machine learning technique related to random forest led to 87% accuracy, whereas logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis led to 69% and 50% accuracy, respectively, in the testing sample. We find that bagging, boosting, and random forest models outperform the others techniques, and that all prediction accuracy in the testing sample improves when the additional variables are included. Our research adds to the discussion of the continuing debate about superiority of computational methods over statistical techniques such as in Tsai, Hsu, and Yen (2014) and Yeh, Chi, and Lin (2014). In particular, for machine learning mechanisms, we do not find \{SVM\} to lead to higher accuracy rates than other models. This result contradicts outcomes from Danenas and Garsva (2015) and Cleofas-Sánchez, García, Marqués, and Sénchez (2016), but corroborates, for instance, Wang, Ma, and Yang (2014), Liang, Lu, Tsai, and Shih (2016), and Cano et al.

The second layer trains a radial basis function based \{KELM\} classifier on different fusion scores obtained from the first layer to predict the final action class label. Finally, we empirically show the superior performance of DKELM, both in terms of accuracy and computational time, over some state-of-the-art human action recognition methods on two large-scale datasets.

In RLMP-ELM, a novel error criterion for cost function, namely the least mean p-power (LMP) error criterion, provides a mechanism to update the output weights sequentially. The \{LMP\} error criterion aims to minimize the mean p-power of the error that is the generalization of the mean square error criterion used in the ELM. The proposed on-line learning algorithm is able to provide on-line predictions of variables with noises of different statistics and obtains better performance than \{ELM\} and online sequential \{ELM\} (OS-ELM) while the non-Gaussian noises impact the processes. Simulations are reported to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods. "}

In this study, a new intelligent image-based visual servoing (IBVS) system for eye-in-hand configured robot manipulators using extreme learning machine (ELM) and fuzzy logic (FL) is proposed to solve these common problems of \{VS\} in a single system. As the first stage of the system, the pseudoinverse of the interaction matrix is approximated using trained \{ELMs\} which do not need hidden layer tuning. As the second stage, the classical \{IBVS\} controller is modified by a differential equation regarding initial velocity continuity and an appropriate gain in each loop is assigned by an \{FL\} unit to provide fast convergence within velocity limits. This unit also promotes manipulability of the manipulator to avoid singularities. As the last stage of the proposed system, regions are defined in the image plane to take precautions before feature missing. When a feature comes close to the edge of a restricted region, an \{FL\} unit is activated to obtain negative linear velocities in x and y direction which will be added to the instant velocities to drag the features towards the center of the FOV. In addition to these abilities, some \{VS\} metrics are redefined analytically to standardize the performance metric definitions of VS. To show the performance of the proposed system, simulation results of the classical and the proposed \{IBVS\} system under practical disturbances are presented for visual servoing of a Puma 560 arm. The advantages of singular matrix and joint configuration avoidance, adaptive gain with smooth gain surface, decreased convergence time within velocity limits, initial velocity continuity, \{FOV\} keeping with smooth velocity assurance, redefined \{VS\} metrics for standardization and robustness against disturbances are proved by variety of simulations. The simulation results also verify that the proposed system utilizing intelligent methods like \{ELM\} and \{FL\} is capable of dealing with common problems of \{VS\} and achieves sufficient results in terms of \{VS\} metrics.

Two data management scenarios were evaluated for estimation of ET0: (1) the models were trained/calibrated and tested using the local data of each station; and (2) the models were trained/calibrated using the pooled data from all the stations and tested in each station. In the first scenario, the results showed that the temperature-based \{ELM\} model provided the better estimation than the GRNN, \{HG\} and calibrated \{HG\} models, with average relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 0.198, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.267 mm/d and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) of 0.891, respectively. In the second scenario, \{GRNN\} model provided the most accurate results among the considered models, with average \{RRMSE\} of 0.194, \{MAE\} of 0.263 mm/d and \{NS\} of 0.895, respectively. Both of the temperature-based \{GRNN\} and \{ELM\} performed much better than the \{HG\} and calibrated \{HG\} models for the two scenarios, and the temperature-based \{GRNN\} and \{ELM\} models are appropriate alternatives for accurate estimation of \{ET0\} for Sichuan basin of southwest China, which is very helpful for farmers or irrigation system operators to improve their irrigation scheduling.

Machine Learning can be used to predict the rate of penetration (ROP) during drilling to a great accuracy as shown by Hegde, Wallace, and Gray (2015). This paper illustrates the use of machine learning to predict and increase \{ROP\} effectively. The machine learning model is first used to predict \{ROP\} – with input parameters such as weight on bit (WOB), rotations per minute of the drill bit (RPM), and flow rate of the drilling mud. The input parameters are then modified to increase ROP. This process has been applied to field drilling data from a vertical well consisting of different rocks and formations. The procedure can be used to determine the maximum achievable \{ROP\} in each formation, and map out operational guidelines for drilling of pad wells. A post drilling analysis can be conducted for pad wells to cut costs and save time while drilling. This model is very innovative because only surface measured parameters are used, without a priori requirements for geological, laboratory, or drilling data. "}

In allusion to this phenomenon, this paper presents an adaptive ensemble of model for the probabilistic WSF, which is based on combination of the adaptive ensemble of on-line sequential \{ORELM\} (OS-ORELM) and the time-varying mixture copula function (TVMCF) to perform multi-step WSF. An OS-ORELM with forgetting mechanism based on Cook’s distance ( λ \{CDFF\} OS-ORELM) serves as a basic \{WSF\} model and an on-line ensemble using ordered aggregation (OEOA) technique is employed to improve the prediction performance. In the data pre-processing period, the Bernaola Galvan algorithm (BGA) is employed to partition the raw wind speed series into segments and the adaptive variational mode decomposition (AVMD) is used to decompose each segment into sub-series with different sub-band. Each transformed sub-series is well-modeled with the application of λ \{CDFF\} OS-ORELM-OEOA, which is optimized by modified crisscross optimization algorithm (CSO). Eventual forecast results are obtained through aggregate calculation. Then the probabilistic prediction intervals (PIs) of wind speed are established in a \{TVMCF\} framework by modeling the conditional forecasting error. Case studies using the real wind speed data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) demonstrate that the proposed model can not only improves point forecasts compared with benchmark methods, but also constructs higher quality of probabilistic PIs.

Customer demands are satisfied subject to limited plant production and limited depot storage capacity. The objective is to determine the locations of plants and depots in order to minimize the total cost including the fixed cost and transportation cost. However, the problem is known to be NP-hard. A practicable exact algorithm is impossible to be developed. In order to solve large-sized problems encountered in the practical decision process, an efficient alternative approximate method becomes more valuable. This paper aims to propose a hybrid evolutionary algorithm framework with machine learning fitness approximation for delivering better solutions in a reasonable amount of computational time. In our study, genetic operators are adopted to perform the search process and a local search strategy is used to refine the best solution found in the population. To avoid the expensive consumption of computational time during the fitness evaluating process, the framework uses extreme machine learning to approximate the fitness of most individuals. Moreover, two heuristics based on the characteristics of the problem is incorporated to generate a good initial population. Computational experiments are performed on two sets of test instances from the recent literature. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and analyzed. Compared with other algorithms in the literature, the proposed algorithm can find the optimal or near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of computational time. By employing the proposed algorithm, facilities can be positioned more efficiently, which means the fixed cost and the transportation cost can be decreased significantly, and organizations can enhance competitiveness by using the optimized facility location scheme.

Methods In this study, we used support vector machines (SVMs) and ensemble methods (EMs) such as boosted and bagged trees to classify drugs into approved and withdrawn categories. Also, we used \{CORINA\} Symphony program to identify Toxprint chemotypes including over 700 predefined chemotypes for determination of risk and safety assesment of candidate drug molecules. In addition, we studied nervous system withdrawn drugs to determine the key fragments with The ParMol package including gSpan algorithm. Results According to our results, the descriptors named as the number of total chemotypes and bond CN_amine_aliphatic_generic were more significant descriptors. The developed Medium Gaussian \{SVM\} model reached 78% prediction accuracy on test set for drug data set including all disease. Here, bagged tree and linear \{SVM\} models showed 89% of accuracies for phycholeptics and psychoanaleptics drugs.

abstract = {"Abstract The thickness of tectonically deformed coal (TDC) has positive correlation associations with gas outbursts. In order to predict the \{TDC\} thickness of coal beds, we propose a new quantitative predicting method using an extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, a principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm, and seismic attributes. At first, we build an \{ELM\} prediction model using the \{PCA\} attributes of a synthetic seismic section. The results suggest that the \{ELM\} model can produce a reliable and accurate prediction of the \{TDC\} thickness for synthetic data, preferring Sigmoid activation function and 20 hidden nodes. Then, we analyze the applicability of the \{ELM\} model on the thickness prediction of the \{TDC\} with real application data. Through the cross validation of near-well traces, the results suggest that the \{ELM\} model can produce a reliable and accurate prediction of the TDC. After that, we use 250 near-well traces from 10 wells to build an \{ELM\} predicting model and use the model to forecast the \{TDC\} thickness of the No. 15 coal in the study area using the \{PCA\} attributes as the inputs. Comparing the predicted results, it is noted that the trained \{ELM\} model with two selected \{PCA\} attributes yields better predication results than those from the other combinations of the attributes. Finally, the trained \{ELM\} model with real seismic data have a different number of hidden nodes (10) than the trained \{ELM\} model with synthetic seismic data. In summary, it is feasible to use an \{ELM\} model to predict the \{TDC\} thickness using the calculated \{PCA\} attributes as the inputs. However, the input attributes, the activation function and the number of hidden nodes in the \{ELM\} model should be selected and tested carefully based on individual application. "}

The finite element method (FEM) is one of the most popular techniques used to predict the deformation of the human soft tissue due to its high accuracy. However, \{FEM\} has an associated high computational cost, which makes it difficult its integration in real-time computer-aided surgery systems. An alternative for simulating the mechanical behaviour of human organs in real time comes from the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, which are much faster than FEM. This paper assesses the feasibility of \{ML\} methods for modelling the biomechanical behaviour of the human liver during the breathing process, which is crucial for guiding surgeons during interventions where it is critical to track this deformation (e.g. some specific kind of biopsies) or for the accurate application of radiotherapy dose to liver tumours. For this purpose, different \{ML\} regression models were investigated, including three tree-based methods (decision trees, random forests and extremely randomised trees) and other two simpler regression techniques (dummy model and linear regression). In order to build and validate the \{ML\} models, a labelled data set was constructed from modelling the deformation of eight ex-vivo human livers using FEM. The best prediction performance was obtained using extremely randomised trees, with a mean error of 0.07 mm and all the samples with an error under 1 mm. The achieved results lay the foundation for the future development of some real-time software capable of simulating the human liver deformation during the breathing process during clinical interventions.

However, research has shown that companies perform better when they apply data-driven decision-making. This creates an incentive to introduce intelligent, data-based decision models, which are comprehensive and support the interactive evaluation of decision options necessary for the business environment. Recently, a new general explanation methodology has been proposed, which supports the explanation of state-of-the-art black-box prediction models. Uniform explanations are generated on the level of model/individual instance and support what-if analysis. We present a novel use of this methodology inside an intelligent system in a real-world case of business-to-business (B2B) sales forecasting, a complex task frequently done judgmentally. Users can validate their assumptions with the presented explanations and test their hypotheses using the presented what-if parallel graph representation. The results demonstrate effectiveness and usability of the methodology. A significant advantage of the presented method is the possibility to evaluate seller’s actions and to outline general recommendations in sales strategy. This flexibility of the approach and easy-to-follow explanations are suitable for many different applications. Our well-documented real-world case shows how to solve a decision support problem, namely that the best performing black-box models are inaccessible to human interaction and analysis. This could extend the use of the intelligent systems to areas where they were so far neglected due to their insistence on comprehensible models. A separation of the machine learning model selection from model explanation is another significant benefit for expert and intelligent systems. Explanations unconnected to a particular prediction model positively influence acceptance of new and complex models in the business environment through their easy assessment and switching. "}

Little is known about whether the association between \{PSG\} and subjective sleep quality changes with age, or whether quantitative assessment of \{EEG\} (qEEG) is associated with sleep quality. We therefore examined the relationship between subjective sleep quality and objective sleep characteristics (standard polysomnography and qEEG) across middle to older adulthood. Methods Using a cross-sectional analyses of 3,173 community-dwelling men and women ages 39-90 participating in the Sleep Heart Health Study, we examined the relationship between a morning rating of the prior night’s sleep quality (Sleep Depth and Restfulness) and polysomnographic and qEEG descriptors of that single night of sleep, along with clinical and demographic measures. Multivariable models were constructed using two machine learning methods, lasso penalized regressions and random forests. Results Little variance was explained across models. Greater objective sleep efficiency, reduced wake after sleep onset and fewer sleep to wake stage transitions were each associated with higher sleep quality; qEEG variables contributed little explanatory power. The oldest adults reported the highest sleep quality even as objective sleep deteriorated, such that they would rate their sleep better given the same level of sleep efficiency. Despite this, there were no major differences in the predictors of subjective sleep across the age span. Conclusion Standard metrics derived from polysomnography, including qEEG, contribute little to explaining subjective sleep quality in middle-aged to older adults. The objective correlates of subjective sleep quality do not appear to systematically change with age, despite a change in the relationship between subjective sleep quality and objective sleep efficiency.

This paper presents a novel temperature and humidity prediction model based on convex bidirectional extreme learning machine (CB-ELM). Simulation results show that the convergence rate of the bidirectional extreme learning machine (B-ELM) can further be improved while retaining the same simplicity, by simply recalculating the output weights of the existing nodes based on a convex optimization method when a new hidden node is randomly added. The performance of the CB-ELM model is compared with other modeling approaches by applying it to predict solar greenhouse temperature and humidity. The experiment results show that the CB-ELM model predictions are more accurate than those of the B-ELM, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Radial Basis Function (RBF). Therefore, it can be considered as a suitable and effective method for predicting the solar greenhouse temperature and humidity. "}

Unconventional strategies for elucidating the genetic mechanisms are necessary due to its polygenic nature. In this work, the input information sources are five: a public \{DNA\} microarray that measures expression levels of control and patient samples, repositories of known genes associated to Alzheimer’s disease, additional data, Gene Ontology and finally, a literature review or expert knowledge to validate the results. As methodology to identify genes highly related to this disease, we present the integration of three machine learning techniques: particularly, we have used decision trees, quantitative association rules and hierarchical cluster to analyze Alzheimer’s disease gene expression profiles to identify genes highly linked to this neurodegenerative disease, through changes in their expression levels between control and patient samples. We propose an ensemble of decision trees and quantitative association rules to find the most suitable configurations of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm GarNet, in order to overcome the complex parametrization intrinsic to this type of algorithms. To fulfill this goal, GarNet has been executed using multiple configuration settings and the well-known C4.5 has been used to find the minimum accuracy to be satisfied. Then, GarNet is rerun to identify dependencies between genes and their expression levels, so we are able to distinguish between healthy individuals and Alzheimer’s patients using the configurations that overcome the minimum threshold of accuracy defined by C4.5 algorithm. Finally, a hierarchical cluster analysis has been used to validate the obtained gene-Alzheimer’s Disease associations provided by GarNet. The results have shown that the obtained rules were able to successfully characterize the underlying information, grouping relevant genes for Alzheimer Disease. The genes reported by our approach provided two well defined groups that perfectly divided the samples between healthy and Alzheimer’s Disease patients. To prove the relevance of the obtained results, a statistical test and gene expression fold-change were used. Furthermore, this relevance has been summarized in a volcano plot, showing two clearly separated and significant groups of genes that are up or down-regulated in Alzheimer’s Disease patients. A biological knowledge integration phase was performed based on the information fusion of systematic literature review, enrichment Gene Ontology terms for the described genes found in the hippocampus of patients. Finally, a validation phase with additional data and a permutation test is carried out, being the results consistent with previous studies. "}

As a preferable modelling approach, the cellular automaton (CA) has been used to simulate the complex mechanisms of fire spreading. However, in traditional \{CA\} models, comprehensive studies on the physical principles of forest fires are needed to define the local transition rules. Instead of defining transition rules, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was applied in this study. By integrating the \{ELM\} with the traditional forest fire \{CA\} framework, a new cellular automaton modelling approach was proposed. After that, its performance was validated using data collected from five fires in the west of United States. Results show that the \{ELM\} performed well in predicting each cell’s igniting probability. The impact of wind velocity on fire spreading pattern can be effectively described by the proposed modelling approach. Furthermore, the validation against actual fire behavior observations shows that its simulation performance is acceptable and in most cases is better than that of the previously reported studies.

Four loss functions (i.e., ℓ1-norm, Huber, Bisquare and Welsch) are used to enhance the robustness, and two types of regularization (ℓ2-norm and ℓ1-norm) are used to avoid overfitting. Experiments show that our proposed RELM-IRLS with ℓ2-norm and ℓ1-norm regularization is stable and accurate for data with 0 ∼ 40 % outlier levels, and that RELM-IRLS with ℓ1-norm regularization can obtain a compact network because of the highly sparse output weights of the network.

Among several deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate superior performance when compared to other machine learning methods in the applications of object detection and recognition. We use a \{CNN\} for image enhancement and the detection of driving lanes on motorways. In general, the process of lane detection consists of edge extraction and line detection. A \{CNN\} can be used to enhance the input images before lane detection by excluding noise and obstacles that are irrelevant to the edge detection result. However, training conventional \{CNNs\} requires considerable computation and a big dataset. Therefore, we suggest a new learning algorithm for \{CNNs\} using an extreme learning machine (ELM). The \{ELM\} is a fast learning method used to calculate network weights between output and hidden layers in a single iteration and thus, can dramatically reduce learning time while producing accurate results with minimal training data. A conventional \{ELM\} can be applied to networks with a single hidden layer; as such, we propose a stacked \{ELM\} architecture in the \{CNN\} framework. Further, we modify the backpropagation algorithm to find the targets of hidden layers and effectively learn network weights while maintaining performance. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method is effective in reducing learning time and improving performance. "}

abstract = {"Abstract To achieve energy efficiency in the Internet-of-Things (IoT), more intelligence is required in the wireless IoT nodes. Otherwise, the energy required by the wireless communication of raw sensor data will prohibit battery lifetime, the backbone of IoT. One option to achive this intelligence is to implement a variety of machine learning algorithms on the IoT sensor instead of the cloud. Shown here is sub-milliwatt machine learning accelerator operating at the Ultra-Low Voltage Minimum-Energy Point. The accelerator is a Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA) Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processor (ASIP) targeted for running various Machine Learning algorithms. The \{ASIP\} is implemented in 28 nm \{FDSOI\} (Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator) \{CMOS\} process, with an operating voltage of 0.35 V, and is capable of 5.3pJ/cycle and 1.8nJ/iteration when performing conventional machine learning algorithms. The \{ASIP\} also includes hardware and compiler support for approximate computing. With the machine learning algorithms, computing approximately brings a maximum of 4.7% energy savings. "}

However, similar to other constructive ELM, EM-ELM lays much emphasis on the convergence accuracy, which may obtain a single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN) with good convergence performance but bad condition. In this paper, an effective approach based on error minimized \{ELM\} and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to adaptively determine the structure of \{SLFN\} for regression problem. In the new method, to establish a compact and well-conditioning SLFN, the hidden node optimized by \{PSO\} is added to the \{SLFN\} one by one. Moreover, not only the regression accuracy but also the condition value of the hidden output matrix of the network is considered in the optimization process. Experiment results on various regression problems verify that the proposed algorithm achieves better generalization performance with fewer hidden nodes than other constructive ELM. "}

For the purpose of relieving the limitation of memory with big data, in this paper, we exploit a novel distributed model to implement the extreme learning machine algorithm in parallel for large-scale data set, namely distributed extreme learning machine (DELM). A corresponding algorithm is developed on the basis of alternating direction method of multipliers which has shown its effectiveness in distributed convex optimization.

The major objective of the reservoir characterization process is to produce models that are robust enough to help improve the accuracy of the predictions of reservoir properties for use in full-field and large-scale simulation models. Research in \{CI\} continues to evolve new techniques and paradigms to meet this noble objective. It has been shown that there are uncertainties in the reservoir characterization process as well as the optimal choice of CI/HIS models parameters. The main challenge is to develop models that are capable of handling multiple hypotheses to reduce the uncertainties thereby ensuring optimal solutions. The ensemble machine learning paradigm has been established to tackle this challenge. This new machine learning technology has not been adequately explored in handling some of the petroleum engineering challenges. This paper rigorously reviews the concept of ensemble learning paradigm, presents successful applications outside petroleum engineering and the geosciences, discusses a few successful attempts in petroleum engineering and the geosciences, and concludes with some recommendations for the much-needed future applications.

This is having a significant medical impact on children and adults who are at risk of developing osteoarthritis, coronary heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancers, respiratory problems, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In an attempt to redress the issue, physical activity is being promoted as a fundamental component for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Recommendations for physical activity levels are issued by most governments as part of their public health measures. However, current techniques and protocols, including those used in laboratory settings, have been criticised. The main concern is that it is not feasible to use multiple pieces of measurement hardware, such as \{VO2\} masks and heart rate monitors, to monitor children in free-living environments due to weight and encumbrance constraints. This has prompted research in the use of wearable sensing and machine learning technology to produce classifications for specific physical activity events. This paper builds on this approach and presents a supervised machine learning method that utilises data obtained from accelerometer sensors worn by children in free-living environments. Our results show that when using an artificial neural network algorithm it is possible to obtain an overall accuracy of 96% using four features from the initial dataset, with sensitivity and specificity values equal to 95% and 99% respectively. Expanding the dataset with interpolated cases, it was possible to improve on these results with 98.8% for accuracy, and 99% for sensitivity and specificity when four features were used. "}

abstract = {"Abstract End-to-end learning machines enable a direct mapping from the raw input data to the desired outputs, eliminating the need for hand-crafted features. Despite less engineering effort than the hand-crafted counterparts, these learning machines achieve extremely good results for many computer vision and medical image analysis tasks. Two dominant classes of end-to-end learning machines are massive-training artificial neural networks (MTANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although \{MTANNs\} have been actively used for a number of medical image analysis tasks over the past two decades, \{CNNs\} have recently gained popularity in the field of medical imaging. In this study, we have compared these two successful learning machines both experimentally and theoretically. For that purpose, we considered two well-studied topics in the field of medical image analysis: detection of lung nodules and distinction between benign and malignant lung nodules in computed tomography (CT). For a thorough analysis, we used 2 optimized \{MTANN\} architectures and 4 distinct \{CNN\} architectures that have different depths. Our experiments demonstrated that the performance of \{MTANNs\} was substantially higher than that of \{CNN\} when using only limited training data. With a larger training dataset, the performance gap became less evident even though the margin was still significant. Specifically, for nodule detection, \{MTANNs\} generated 2.7 false positives per patient at 100% sensitivity, which was significantly ( p &lt; 0.05 ) lower than the best performing \{CNN\} model with 22.7 false positives per patient at the same level of sensitivity. For nodule classification, \{MTANNs\} yielded an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.8806 (95% CI: 0.8389–0.9223), which was significantly ( p &lt; 0.05 ) greater than the best performing \{CNN\} model with an \{AUC\} of 0.7755 (95% CI: 0.7120–0.8270). Thus, with limited training data, \{MTANNs\} would be a suitable end-to-end machine-learning model for detection and classification of focal lesions that do not require high-level semantic features.

abstract = {"Abstract The deconvolution of \{DNA\} mixtures remains one of the most critical challenges in the field of forensic \{DNA\} analysis. In addition, of all the data features required to perform such deconvolution, the number of contributors in the sample is widely considered the most important, and, if incorrectly chosen, the most likely to negatively influence the mixture interpretation of a \{DNA\} profile. Unfortunately, most current approaches to mixture deconvolution require the assumption that the number of contributors is known by the analyst, an assumption that can prove to be especially faulty when faced with increasingly complex mixtures of 3 or more contributors. In this study, we propose a probabilistic approach for estimating the number of contributors in a \{DNA\} mixture that leverages the strengths of machine learning. To assess this approach, we compare classification performances of six machine learning algorithms and evaluate the model from the top-performing algorithm against the current state of the art in the field of contributor number classification. Overall results show over 98% accuracy in identifying the number of contributors in a \{DNA\} mixture of up to 4 contributors. Comparative results showed 3-person mixtures had a classification accuracy improvement of over 6% compared to the current best-in-field methodology, and that 4-person mixtures had a classification accuracy improvement of over 20%. The Probabilistic Assessment for Contributor Estimation (PACE) also accomplishes classification of mixtures of up to 4 contributors in less than 1 s using a standard laptop or desktop computer. Considering the high classification accuracy rates, as well as the significant time commitment required by the current state of the art model versus seconds required by a machine learning-derived model, the approach described herein provides a promising means of estimating the number of contributors and, subsequently, will lead to improved \{DNA\} mixture interpretation.

New insights into the \{ELM\} model are obtained, and the \{ELM\} strategy for the setup of the neurons’ parameters can be significantly improved. Experimental results confirm that the novel method improves over conventional approaches, especially in the trade-off between classification accuracy and machine complexity (i.e., the dimensionality of the remapped space).

The proposed approach is based on Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) and Extreme learning machine (ELM). The system taken for testing of the proposed method consists of different types of \{DGs\} like hydro turbine generator with synchronous machine and wind turbine generator with asynchronous machine. The analysis starts with extracting the non-stationary three phase voltage signals at the target \{DG\} end and decomposed into mono component signals, called intrinsic mode function (IMF), by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. In the next step, the amplitude, phase angle and frequency of the components are computed by applying the \{HHT\} to each IMF. Then, the different distinguish features are calculated such as, energy, standard deviation of phase and amplitude to track the islanding condition from different non-islanding conditions like single line to ground fault, line to line fault, three phase fault, voltage sag, voltage swell, sudden load change, capacitor switching and other \{DG\} tripping etc. To test the accuracy of proposed method, a modified \{ELM\} classifier is developed based on the feature index. It has been found that the proposed HHT–ELM technique is highly successful to discriminate islanding events under a wide range of operating conditions from the other type of disturbances in the power distribution network. The proposed scheme is simulated by the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. "}

abstract = {"AbstractBackground and objective Collagen proportional area (CPA) extraction in liver biopsy images provides the degree of fibrosis expansion in liver tissue, which is the most characteristic histological alteration in hepatitis C virus (HCV). Assessment of the fibrotic tissue is currently based on semiquantitative staging scores such as Ishak and Metavir. Since its introduction as a fibrotic tissue assessment technique, \{CPA\} calculation based on image analysis techniques has proven to be more accurate than semiquantitative scores. However, \{CPA\} has yet to reach everyday clinical practice, since the lack of standardized and robust methods for computerized image analysis for \{CPA\} assessment have proven to be a major limitation. Methods The current work introduces a three-stage fully automated methodology for \{CPA\} extraction based on machine learning techniques. Specifically, clustering algorithms have been employed for background-tissue separation, as well as for fibrosis detection in liver tissue regions, in the first and the third stage of the methodology, respectively. Due to the existence of several types of tissue regions in the image (such as blood clots, muscle tissue, structural collagen, etc.), classification algorithms have been employed to identify liver tissue regions and exclude all other non-liver tissue regions from \{CPA\} computation. Results For the evaluation of the methodology, 79 liver biopsy images have been employed, obtaining 1.31% mean absolute \{CPA\} error, with 0.923 concordance correlation coefficient. Conclusions The proposed methodology is designed to (i) avoid manual threshold-based and region selection processes, widely used in similar approaches presented in the literature, and (ii) minimize \{CPA\} calculation time.

Since \{ELM\} has an excellent performance on regression and classification problems, it has been paid more and more attention recently. The determination of structure of \{ELM\} plays a vital role in \{ELM\} applications. Essentially, determination of the structure of \{ELM\} is equivalent to the determination of the hidden layer structure. Utilizing a smaller scale of the hidden layer structure can promote faster running speed. In this paper, we propose algorithm PCI-ELM (Pruned-Convex Incremental Extreme Learning Machine) based on CI-ELM (Convex Incremental Extreme Learning Machine). Furthermore, we also present an improved PCI-ELM algorithm, EPCI-ELM (Enhanced Pruned-Convex Incremental Extreme Learning Machine), which introduces a filtering strategy for PCI-ELM during the neurons adding process. In order to adjust the single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural network more flexibly and achieve the most compact form of the hidden layer structure, in this paper, we propose an algorithm which can dynamically determine hidden layer structure, DCI-ELM (Dynamic Convex Incremental Extreme Learning Machine).

A key component for a successful treatment is the identification of the most appropriate gel technology for a targeted reservoir. Advanced approaches provide efficient screening and ranking tools; however, to the best of our knowledge, no such approaches have been developed for polymer gels so far. In this study, we utilized a machine-learning technique to develop an advanced selection methodology for the application of polymer gels in injection wells. Historical data of four in-situ gel systems including bulk gels, high temperature bulk gels, colloidal dispersion gels, and weak gels were used to train logistic regression models. Data sets of 19 property or parameter were tested for potential outliers, missing values were imputed, and some variables were categorized in order to treat data gaps. To identify the most discriminating variables, the univariate entropy R2, stepwise regression, and area under \{ROC\} curve (AUC) heuristic technique were employed. The candidate variables were then modified according to some considerations like the match of univariate logistic probability to conformance engineering considerations. To consider the regional tendencies in application of polymer gels, we developed three probabilistic models that include different number of treating technologies. Furthermore, to meet the new developments in the application of some gel systems, we constructed a variant model without the treatment timing indicator (water cut) for each main logistic classifier. Results show that logistic classification models and their variants correctly predict the proper gel technology in more than 85% of projects in the training and validation samples with a minimum \{AUC\} of 0.9375. We also used a prediction profiler to visually monitor performances of the classifiers and certain tendencies were identified by the investigation of the mispredicted projects. The novelty of the new methodology is its capability to predict the most applicable gel technology for undiagnosed injection wells. "}

Existing approaches for imbalance learning only consider the effect of the number of the class samples ignoring the dispersion degree of the data, and may lead to the suboptimal learning results. In this paper, we will propose a novel ELM, class-specific cost regulation extreme learning machine (CCR-ELM), together with its kernel based extension, for binary and multiclass classification problems with imbalanced data distributions. CCR-ELM introduces class-specific regulation cost for misclassification of each class in the performance index as the tradeoff of structural risk and empirical risk. The performance of CCR-ELM is verified using a number of benchmark datasets and the real blast furnace status diagnosis problem. Experimental results show that CCR-ELM can achieve better performance for classification problems with imbalanced data distributions than the original \{ELM\} and existing \{ELM\} imbalance learning approach, and the kernel based CCR-ELM can improve the performance further.

This procedure is highly significant since the transformation cost of images from Mars to earth is extremely high. Also, image analysis may help Mars rover for its navigation and localization. In this paper, a new feature vector including wavelet and color features for Mars images is proposed. Then, this feature vector is presented for extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier which leads to a high accuracy pixel classifier. It is shown that this system statistically outperforms support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbours (KNNs) classifiers with respect to both accuracy and run time. After that, dimension reduction in feature space is done by two proposed feature section algorithms based on ant colony optimization (ACO) to decrease the time complexity which is very important in Mars on-board applications. In the first proposed feature selection algorithm, the same feature subset is selected among the feature vector for all pixel classes, while in the second proposed algorithm, the most significant features are selected for each pixel class, separately. Proposed pixel classifier with complete feature set outperforms prior methods by 6.44% and 5.84% with respect to average Fmeasure and accuracy, respectively. Finally, proposed feature selection methods decrease the feature vector size up to 76% and achieves Fmeasure and accuracy of 91.72% and 91.05%, respectively, which outperforms prior methods with 87.22% and 86.64%.

Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network with fast training rate and good generalization capability, but due to the existence of training error, \{ELM\} cannot be directly used to handle monotonic classification problems. This work proposes a generalization of \{ELM\} for processing the monotonic classification, named as Monotonic Classification Extreme Learning Machine (MCELM) in which the monotonicity constraints are imposed to the original \{ELM\} model. Mathematically, \{MCELM\} is a quadratic programming problem in which the monotonicity relationships are considered as constraints and the training error is the objective to be minimized. The mathematical model of \{MCELM\} not only can make the generated classifier monotonic but also can minimize the classification error. \{MCELM\} does not need to tune parameters iteratively, and therefore, keeps the advantage of extremely fast training which is the essential characteristic of ELM. \{MCELM\} does not require that the monotonic relationships existing between features and the output are consistent, which essentially relaxes the assumption of consistent monotonicity used in most existing approaches to handling monotonic classification problems. In comparison with exiting approaches to handling monotonic classification, \{MCELM\} can indeed generate a monotonicity-reserving classifier which experimentally shows a much better generalization capability on both artificial and real world datasets.

But, traditional methods based one-class classifiers are very time consuming due to its iterative process and various parameters tuning. In this paper, we present six \{OCC\} methods and their thirteen variants based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and online sequential \{ELM\} (OSELM). Our proposed classifiers mainly lie in two categories: reconstruction based and boundary based, where three proposed classifiers belong to reconstruction based and three belong to boundary based. We are presenting both types of learning viz., online and offline learning for OCC. Out of six methods, four are offline and remaining two are online methods. Out of four offline methods, two methods perform random feature mapping and two methods perform kernel feature mapping. We present a comprehensive discussion on these methods and their comparison to each other. Kernel feature mapping based approaches have been tested with \{RBF\} kernel and online version of one-class classifiers is tested with both types of nodes viz., additive and RBF. It is well known fact that threshold decision is a crucial factor in case of OCC, so, three different threshold deciding criteria have been employed so far and analyze the effectiveness of one threshold deciding criteria over another. Further, these methods are tested on two artificial datasets to check their boundary construction capability and on eight benchmark datasets from different discipline to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Our proposed classifiers exhibit better performance compared to ten traditional one-class classifiers and \{ELM\} based two one-class classifiers. Through proposed one-class classifiers, we intend to expand the functionality of the most used toolbox for \{OCC\} i.e. \{DD\} toolbox.

Further, a unified random orthogonal (RO) projection method is proposed, and it is shown that such \{RO\} method can always provide the optimal transformation in terms of minimizing the loss of all the distances between samples. Experimental results on real-world benchmark data sets verify the rationality of theoretical analysis and indicate that by enhancing the \{SSP\} capability of input weights, \{QMC\} and \{RO\} projection methods tend to bring \{ELM\} algorithms better generalization performance.

Multi-graph classification is a supervised learning problem, which has a wide range of applications, such as scientific publication categorization, bio-pharmaceutical activity tests and online product recommendation. However, existing algorithms are limited to process small datasets due to high computation complexity of multi-graph classification. Specially, the precision is not high enough for a large dataset. In this paper, we propose a scalable and high-precision parallel algorithm to handle the multi-graph classification problem on massive datasets using MapReduce and extreme learning machine. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic graph datasets show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient. "}

Physiological research has shown that neurons at the same layer are laterally inhibited to each other such that outputs of each layer are sparse. However, it is difficult for \{ELM\} to accommodate the lateral inhibition by directly using random feature mapping. Therefore, this paper proposes a sparse coding \{ELM\} (ScELM) algorithm, which can map the input feature vector into a sparse representation. In this proposed ScELM algorithm, an unsupervised way is used for sparse coding and dictionary is randomly assigned rather than learned. Gradient projection based method is used for the sparse coding. The output weights are trained through the same supervised way as ELM. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets have shown that this proposed ScELM algorithm can outperform other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy. "}

The regularization in terms of ν is bounded between 0 and 1, and is easier to interpret as compared to C. This paper shows that: (1) ν-OELM and ν-SVM have similar dual optimization formulation, but ν-OELM has less optimization constraints due to its special capability of class separation and (2) experiment results on both artificial and real binary classification problems show that ν-OELM tends to achieve better generalization performance than ν-SVM, \{OELM\} and other popular machine learning approaches, and it is computationally efficient on high dimension data sets. Additionally, the optimal parameter ν in ν-OELM can be easily selected from few candidates. "}

To enhance forecast accuracy, a novel hybrid forecasting model combining two-phase decomposition technique and extreme learning machine (ELM) optimized by differential evolution (DE) algorithm is developed for \{AQI\} forecasting in this paper. In phase I, the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) is utilized to decompose the \{AQI\} series into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different frequencies; in phase II, in order to further handle the high frequency \{IMFs\} which will increase the forecast difficulty, variational mode decomposition (VMD) is employed to decompose the high frequency \{IMFs\} into a number of variational modes (VMs). Then, the \{ELM\} model optimized by \{DE\} algorithm is applied to forecast all the \{IMFs\} and VMs. Finally, the forecast value of each high frequency \{IMF\} is obtained through adding up the forecast results of all corresponding VMs, and the forecast series of \{AQI\} is obtained by aggregating the forecast results of all IMFs. To verify and validate the proposed model, two daily \{AQI\} series from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016 collected from Beijing and Shanghai located in China are taken as the test cases to conduct the empirical study.

Several main memory-based approaches have been proposed to mine discriminative subgraphs, but they always lack scalability and are not suitable for large-scale graph databases. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a simple and efficient Single-hidden Layer Feedforward neural Networks (SLFNs) algorithm with extremely fast learning capacity. In this paper, we propose a discriminative subgraph mining approach based on ELM-Filter strategy within the scalable MapReduce computing model. We randomly partition the collection of graphs among worker nodes, and each worker applies a fast pattern evolutionary method to mine a set of discriminative subgraphs with the help of ELM-Filter strategy in its partition. And, the set of discriminative subgraphs must produce higher \{ELM\} training accuracy. The union of all such discriminative subgraphs is the mining result for the input large-scale graphs. Also, based on the proposed Support Graph Vector Model (SGVM) and \{ELM\} algorithm, we construct the graph classification model using the mined discriminative subgraphs. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets show that our method obviously outperforms the other approaches in terms of both classification accuracy and runtime efficiency.

These diverse, complex and often high-dimensional data sets exhibit nonlinear dependencies and unknown interactions across multiple variables, and may fail to conform to the assumptions of many classical statistical methods. The field of machine learning provides methodologies that are ideally suited to the task of extracting knowledge from these data. In this review, we aim to introduce animal behaviourists unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) to the promise of these techniques for the analysis of complex behavioural data. We start by describing the rationale behind \{ML\} and review a number of animal behaviour studies where \{ML\} has been successfully deployed. The \{ML\} framework is then introduced by presenting several unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Following this overview, we illustrate key \{ML\} approaches by developing data analytical pipelines for three different case studies that exemplify the types of behavioural and ecological questions \{ML\} can address. The first uses a large number of spectral and morphological characteristics that describe the appearance of pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs to assign them to putative clutches. The second takes a continuous data stream of feeder visits from \{PIT\} (passive integrated transponder)-tagged jackdaws, Corvus monedula, and extracts foraging events from it, which permits the construction of social networks. Our final example uses aerial images to train a classifier that detects the presence of wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, to count individuals in a population. With the advent of cheaper sensing and tracking technologies an unprecedented amount of data on animal behaviour is becoming available. We believe that \{ML\} will play a central role in translating these data into scientific knowledge and become a useful addition to the animal behaviourist's analytical toolkit. "}

abstract = {"Abstract A variable-structure online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is proposed by incorporating a hidden units pruning strategy. As conventional OS-ELM increases network dimensionality by adding newly-received samples as hidden units, the hidden layer dimension would expand and result in “dimensionality curse” finally. Furthermore, the vast number of hidden units cannot represent time-varying dynamics adaptively and would deteriorate the network generalization capability. Therefore, there is a practical need to adjust the dimension of OS-ELM not only by adding hidden units but also by simultaneously pruning superfluous units which contribute less to the output. To evaluate the individual contribution of existing hidden units, an index is proposed referred to as normalized error reduction ratio. The variable structure OS-ELM adds newly received samples in hidden units, and prunes those units contribute less to current dynamics from network simultaneously, thus the resulted network possesses parsimonious structure which can represent current system dynamics more efficiently. The online network structure adjustment approach can handle samples which are presented one-by-one or chuck-by-chuck. The variable-structure OS-ELM (VS-OSELM) can be implemented for online identification and prediction of time-varying systems. In this study, to evaluate the efficiency of VS-OSELM, it was implemented for real-time prediction of tidal level change which is a complex time-varying process. Online tidal prediction simulations is conducted based on the real measured tidal and meteorological data of Old Port Tampa in Florida, United States. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed variable-structure OS-ELM is suitable for identification and prediction of complex time-varying systems with high prediction accuracy and fast computation speed.

abstract = {"AbstractIntroduction The authors of this work propose an unsupervised machine learning model that has the ability to identify real-world latent infectious diseases by mining social media data. In this study, a latent infectious disease is defined as a communicable disease that has not yet been formalized by national public health institutes and explicitly communicated to the general public. Most existing approaches to modeling infectious-disease-related knowledge discovery through social media networks are top-down approaches that are based on already known information, such as the names of diseases and their symptoms. In existing top-down approaches, necessary but unknown information, such as disease names and symptoms, is mostly unidentified in social media data until national public health institutes have formalized that disease. Most of the formalizing processes for latent infectious diseases are time consuming. Therefore, this study presents a bottom-up approach for latent infectious disease discovery in a given location without prior information, such as disease names and related symptoms. Methods Social media messages with user and temporal information are extracted during the data preprocessing stage. An unsupervised sentiment analysis model is then presented. Users’ expressions about symptoms, body parts, and pain locations are also identified from social media data. Then, symptom weighting vectors for each individual and time period are created, based on their sentiment and social media expressions. Finally, latent-infectious-disease-related information is retrieved from individuals’ symptom weighting vectors. Datasets and results Twitter data from August 2012 to May 2013 are used to validate this study. Real electronic medical records for 104 individuals, who were diagnosed with influenza in the same period, are used to serve as ground truth validation.

Conclusion This work uses individuals’ social media messages to identify latent infectious diseases, without prior information, quicker than when the disease(s) is formalized by national public health institutes. In particular, the unsupervised machine learning model using user, textual, and temporal information in social media data, along with sentiment analysis, identifies latent infectious diseases in a given location.

To improve the satisfaction of a user of a BSS, it is useful to inform her/him on the status of the stations at run time, and indeed most of the current systems provide the information in terms of number of bicycles parked in each docking stations by means of services available via web. However, when the departure station is empty, the user could also be happy to know how the situation will evolve and, in particular, if a bike is going to arrive (and vice versa when the arrival station is full). To fulfill this expectation, we envisage services able to make a prediction and infer if there is in use a bike that could be, with high probability, returned at the station where she/he is waiting. The goal of this paper is hence to analyze the feasibility of these services. To this end, we put forward the idea of using Machine Learning methodologies, proposing and comparing different solutions. "}

The full potential of \{RS\} has yet to be harnessed as different nomenclatures and procedures hinder interoperability, comparison and provenance. Therefore, automated tools are needed to use \{RS\} data to produce comparable, empirical data outputs that lend themselves to data discovery and provenance. These issues are addressed by a novel, semi-automatic ontology-based classification method that uses machine learning algorithms and Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontologies that yields traceable, interoperable and observation-based classification outputs. The method was tested on European Union Nature Information System (EUNIS) grasslands in Rheinland-Palatinate, Germany. The developed methodology is a first step in developing observation-based ontologies in the field of nature conservation. The tests show promising results for the determination of the grassland indicators wetness and alkalinity with an overall accuracy of 85% for alkalinity and 76% for wetness. "}

A number of competing viewpoints on nonlinear modal analysis have emerged, each of which preserves a subset of the properties of the original linear theory. From the geometrical point of view, one can argue that the invariant manifold approach of Shaw and Pierre is the most natural generalisation. However, the Shaw–Pierre approach is rather demanding technically, depending as it does on the analytical construction of a mapping between spaces, which maps physical coordinates into invariant manifolds spanned by independent subsets of variables. The objective of the current paper is to demonstrate a data-based approach motivated by Shaw–Pierre method which exploits the idea of statistical independence to optimise a parametric form of the mapping. The approach can also be regarded as a generalisation of the Principal Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). A machine learning approach to inversion of the modal transformation is presented, based on the use of Gaussian processes, and this is equivalent to a nonlinear form of modal superposition. However, it is shown that issues can arise if the forward transformation is a polynomial and can thus have a multi-valued inverse. The overall approach is demonstrated using a number of case studies based on both simulated and experimental data. "}

Despite the large literature and the advancements in this research field, the univocal attribution of tephra deposits to specific volcanic sources remains too often elusive. In this contribution, we test the application of a machine learning technique named Support Vector Machine to attempt shedding new light upon tephra deposits related to one of the most complex and debated volcanic regions on Earth: the Pliocene-Pleistocene magmatism in Italy. The machine learning algorithm was trained using one of the most comprehensive global petrological databases (GEOROC); 17 chemical elements including major (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3T, CaO, MgO, MnO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5) and selected trace (Sr, Ba, Rb, Zr, Nb, La, Ce) elements were chosen as input parameters. We first show the ability of support vector machines in discriminating among different Pliocene-Pleistocene volcanic provinces in Italy and then apply the same methodology to determine the volcanic source of tephra samples occurring in the Caio outcrop, an Early Pleistocene sedimentary section located in Central Italy. Our results show that: 1) support vector machines can successfully resolve high-dimensional tephrochronological problems overcoming the intrinsic limitation of two- and three-dimensional discrimination diagrams; 2) support vector machines can discriminate among different volcanic provinces in complex magmatic regions; 3) in the specific case study, support vector machines indicate that the most probable source for the investigated tephra samples is the so-called Roman Magmatic Province. These results have strong geochronological and geodynamical implications suggesting new age constraints (1.4 Ma instead of 0.8 Ma) for the starting of the volcanic activity in the Roman Magmatic Province.

Here, we report a novel approach of identifying and validating distinct and biologically meaningful clinical phenotypes of bipolar disorders using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. First, neurocognitive data were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning approach and two distinct clinical phenotypes identified namely; phenotype I and phenotype II. Second, diffusion weighted imaging scans were pre-processed using the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method and ‘skeletonized’ white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps extracted. The ‘skeletonized’ white matter \{FA\} and \{MD\} maps were entered into the Elastic Net machine learning algorithm to distinguish individual subjects' phenotypic labels (e.g. phenotype I vs. phenotype II). This calculation was performed to ascertain whether the identified clinical phenotypes were biologically distinct. Original neurocognitive measurements distinguished individual subjects' phenotypic labels with 94% accuracy (sensitivity = 92%, specificity = 97%). \{TBSS\} derived \{FA\} and \{MD\} measurements predicted individual subjects' phenotypic labels with 76% and 65% accuracy respectively. In addition, individual subjects belonging to phenotypes I and \{II\} were distinguished from healthy controls with 57% and 92% accuracy respectively. Neurocognitive task variables identified as most relevant in distinguishing phenotypic labels included; Affective Go/No-Go (AGN), Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) coupled with inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and callosal white matter pathways. These results suggest that there may exist two biologically distinct clinical phenotypes in bipolar disorders which can be identified from healthy controls with high accuracy and at an individual subject level. We suggest a strong clinical utility of the proposed approach in defining and validating biologically meaningful and less heterogeneous clinical sub-phenotypes of major psychiatric disorders. "}

However, the increasing scale, density and complexity of modern integrated circuits pose new challenges to both of the \{OPC\} computational intensity and mask manufacturability. This paper aims at developing a practical \{OPC\} algorithm based on a machine learning technique to effectively reduce the \{PBOPC\} runtime and mask complexity. We first divide the target layout into small regions around corners and edge fragments. Using a nonparametric kernel regression technique, these small regions are then filled in by the weighted linear combination of a subset of training \{OPC\} examples selected from the pre-calculated libraries. To keep balance between the image fidelity and mask complexity, we use an edge-based \{OPC\} (EBOPC) library to synthesize the \{OPC\} patterns in non-critical areas, while use another \{PBOPC\} library for hotspots. In addition, a post-processing method is developed to refine the regressed \{OPC\} pattern so as to guarantee the final image fidelity and mask manufacturability. Experimental results show that, compared to a currently professional \{PBOPC\} software, the proposed algorithm can achieve approximately two-fold speedup and more manufacture-friendly \{OPC\} patterns.

To reduce the runtime required for the Monte Carlo approximation, this article proposes an approximate framework in which the connectivity check of each sample is estimated using a machine-learning-based classifier. The framework is implemented using both a support vector machine (SVM) and a logistic regression based surrogate model. Numerical experiments are performed on the California gas distribution network using the epicenter and magnitude of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake as well as randomly-generated earthquakes. It is shown that the \{SVM\} and logistic regression surrogate models are able to predict network connectivity with accuracies of 99% for both methods, and are 1–2 orders of magnitude faster than using a Monte Carlo method with an exact connectivity check.

Based on our observation that a clinical text describes a patient's medical problems and a doctor's treatments in chronological order, a clinical semantic unit is defined as a problem and/or an action relation. Since a clinical event is a basic unit of the problem and action relation, events are extracted from narrative texts, based on the external knowledge resources context features of the conditional random fields. A clinical semantic unit is extracted from each sentence based on time expressions and context structures of events. Then, a clinical semantic unit is classified into a problem and/or action relation based on the event causality patterns of the support vector machines. Experimental results on Korean discharge summaries show 78.8% performance in the F1-measure. This result shows that the proposed method is effectively classifies clinical Problem-Action relations.

In many real applications of bearings fault diagnosis, the data tend to be online imbalanced, which means, the number of fault data is much less than the normal data while they are all collected in online sequential way. Suffering from this problem, many traditional diagnosis methods will get low accuracy of fault data which acts as the minority class in the collected bearing data. To address this problem, an online sequential prediction method for imbalanced fault diagnosis problem is proposed based on extreme learning machine. This method introduces the principal curve and granulation division to simulate the flow distribution and overall distribution characteristics of fault data, respectively. Then a confident over-sampling and under-sampling process is proposed to establish the initial offline diagnosis model. In online stage, the obtained granules and principal curves are rebuilt on the bearing data which are arrived in sequence, and after the over-sampling and under-sampling process, the balanced sample set is formed to update the diagnosis model dynamically. A theoretical analysis is provided and proves that, even existing information loss, the proposed method has lower bound of the model reliability. Simulation experiments are conducted on \{IMS\} bearing data and \{CWRU\} bearing data. The comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the fault diagnosis accuracy with better effectiveness and robustness than other algorithms. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Injury narratives are now available real time and include useful information for injury surveillance and prevention. However, manual classification of the cause or events leading to injury found in large batches of narratives, such as workers compensation claims databases, can be prohibitive. In this study we compare the utility of four machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Single word and Bi-gram models, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression) for classifying narratives into Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Injury and Illness event leading to injury classifications for a large workers compensation database. These algorithms are known to do well classifying narrative text and are fairly easy to implement with off-the-shelf software packages such as Python. We propose human-machine learning ensemble approaches which maximize the power and accuracy of the algorithms for machine-assigned codes and allow for strategic filtering of rare, emerging or ambiguous narratives for manual review. We compare human-machine approaches based on filtering on the prediction strength of the classifier vs. agreement between algorithms. Regularized Logistic Regression (LR) was the best performing algorithm alone. Using this algorithm and filtering out the bottom 30% of predictions for manual review resulted in high accuracy (overall sensitivity/positive predictive value of 0.89) of the final machine-human coded dataset. The best pairings of algorithms included Naïve Bayes with Support Vector Machine whereby the triple ensemble \{NBSW\} = NBBI-GRAM = \{SVM\} had very high performance (0.93 overall sensitivity/positive predictive value and high accuracy (i.e. high sensitivity and positive predictive values)) across both large and small categories leaving 41% of the narratives for manual review. Integrating \{LR\} into this ensemble mix improved performance only slightly. For large administrative datasets we propose incorporation of methods based on human-machine pairings such as we have done here, utilizing readily-available off-the-shelf machine learning techniques and resulting in only a fraction of narratives that require manual review. Human-machine ensemble methods are likely to improve performance over total manual coding. "}

However, existing expert based identification algorithms often suffer in a low recall rate and could miss a large number of valuable samples under conservative filtering standards. The goal of this work is to develop a semi-automated framework based on machine learning as a pilot study to liberalize filtering criteria to improve recall rate with a keeping of low false positive rate. Materials and methods We propose a data informed framework for identifying subjects with and without \{T2DM\} from \{EHR\} via feature engineering and machine learning. We evaluate and contrast the identification performance of widely-used machine learning models within our framework, including k-Nearest-Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. Our framework was conducted on 300 patient samples (161 cases, 60 controls and 79 unconfirmed subjects), randomly selected from 23,281 diabetes related cohort retrieved from a regional distributed \{EHR\} repository ranging from 2012 to 2014. Results We apply top-performing machine learning algorithms on the engineered features. We benchmark and contrast the accuracy, precision, AUC, sensitivity and specificity of classification models against the state-of-the-art expert algorithm for identification of \{T2DM\} subjects. Our results indicate that the framework achieved high identification performances (∼0.98 in average AUC), which are much higher than the state-of-the-art algorithm (0.71 in AUC). Discussion Expert algorithm-based identification of \{T2DM\} subjects from \{EHR\} is often hampered by the high missing rates due to their conservative selection criteria. Our framework leverages machine learning and feature engineering to loosen such selection criteria to achieve a high identification rate of cases and controls. Conclusions Our proposed framework demonstrates a more accurate and efficient approach for identifying subjects with and without \{T2DM\} from EHR. "}

All models have been trained, optimized, validated and compared with each other and with old and newly suggested regression models, using high-resolution, highly accurate measured data recorded over Cairo, Egypt, throughout five years, as a case study. Models with best statistical measures of accuracy and best generalization abilities have been recommended after being tested using an independent dataset.

This paper presents a new algorithm named fast adaptive shrinkage/thresholding algorithm \{ELM\} (FASTA-ELM) which uses an extension of forward-backward splitting (FBS) to compute the smallest norm of the output weights in ELM. The proposed FASTA-ELM algorithm is evaluated on face gender recognition problem using 5 benchmarked datasets. The results indicate that FASTA-ELM provides efficient performance and outperforms the standard \{ELM\} and two other variants of \{ELM\} in terms of generalization ability and computational time. Furthermore, the recognition performance of FASTA-ELM is comparable to other state-of-the-art face gender recognition methods. "}

For example, the \{ATLAS\} and other detectors at \{CERN\} generate petabytes of data and Facebook stores data with a rate of around 600  \{TB\} daily. In the current context, efficient scheduling for Big Data applications is a challenge and an appropriate scheduling technique is required for different types of incoming requests. In this paper we propose a scheduling algorithm for different types of computation requests: independent tasks, like bag of tasks (BoT) model or tasks with dependencies modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAG), and they will be scheduled for execution in a Cloud datacenter. The tasks in the requests are scheduled on the available resources using the suitable scheduling algorithm for each request. We rely on a machine learning toolbox, named as MLBox, to find what algorithm should be used for a certain request. We implemented four heuristics for scheduling BoTs and four heuristics for \{DAGs\} scheduling and generated the training data for the machine learning algorithm by running multiple traditional scheduling algorithms and selecting the ‘best’ one for a given request. We evaluate the performance by comparing the scheduling of different tasks requests using some of the traditional algorithms and our machine learning based scheduling algorithm. "}

In previous studies, this stratification has been mainly based on analysis of the far wall of the carotid artery. Due to the multifocal nature of atherosclerotic disease, the plaque growth is not restricted to the far wall alone. This paper presents a new approach for stroke risk assessment by integrating assessment of both the near and far walls of the carotid artery using grayscale morphology of the plaque. Further, this paper presents a scientific validation system for stroke risk assessment. Both these innovations have never been presented before. The methodology consists of an automated segmentation system of the near wall and far wall regions in grayscale carotid B-mode ultrasound scans. Sixteen grayscale texture features are computed, and fed into the machine learning system. The training system utilizes the lumen diameter to create ground truth labels for the stratification of stroke risk. The cross-validation procedure is adapted in order to obtain the machine learning testing classification accuracy through the use of three sets of partition protocols: (5, 10, and Jack Knife). The mean classification accuracy over all the sets of partition protocols for the automated system in the far and near walls is 95.08% and 93.47%, respectively. The corresponding accuracies for the manual system are 94.06% and 92.02%, respectively. The precision of merit of the automated machine learning system when compared against manual risk assessment system are 98.05% and 97.53% for the far and near walls, respectively. The \{ROC\} of the risk assessment system for the far and near walls is close to 1.0 demonstrating high accuracy. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Imaging flow cytometry (IFC) enables the high throughput collection of morphological and spatial information from hundreds of thousands of single cells. This high content, information rich image data can in theory resolve important biological differences among complex, often heterogeneous biological samples. However, data analysis is often performed in a highly manual and subjective manner using very limited image analysis techniques in combination with conventional flow cytometry gating strategies. This approach is not scalable to the hundreds of available image-based features per cell and thus makes use of only a fraction of the spatial and morphometric information. As a result, the quality, reproducibility and rigour of results are limited by the skill, experience and ingenuity of the data analyst. Here, we describe a pipeline using open-source software that leverages the rich information in digital imagery using machine learning algorithms. Compensated and corrected raw image files (.rif) data files from an imaging flow cytometer (the proprietary .cif file format) are imported into the open-source software CellProfiler, where an image processing pipeline identifies cells and subcellular compartments allowing hundreds of morphological features to be measured. This high-dimensional data can then be analysed using cutting-edge machine learning and clustering approaches using “user-friendly” platforms such as CellProfiler Analyst. Researchers can train an automated cell classifier to recognize different cell types, cell cycle phases, drug treatment/control conditions, etc., using supervised machine learning. This workflow should enable the scientific community to leverage the full analytical power of IFC-derived data sets. It will help to reveal otherwise unappreciated populations of cells based on features that may be hidden to the human eye that include subtle measured differences in label free detection channels such as bright-field and dark-field imagery.

The overall classification accuracy for the 2000 and 2011 images were 77.1% and 82.9%, respectively. Random Forest regression algorithms were then used for modelling and mapping biomass. The model that integrated spectral, vegetation association type, texture, and vegetation indices obtained the highest accuracy (R2adj = 0.73). Among the different variables, vegetation association type was the most important variable identified by the Random Forest model. Based on the biomass maps generated from the Random Forest, total biomass in the Cangio mangrove forest increased by 820,136 tons over this period, although this change varied between the three different mangrove associations.

Landslide spatial modeling (LSM) in the current research consists of four phases including: (1) determining the relationship between each conditioning factor and landslide occurrences, using the evidential belief function (EBF) model; (2) utilizing \{LSM\} using three geographic information systems (GIS)-based machine-learning models, including the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and Naïve Bayes (NB); (3) evaluating considered models and selecting the best model using receiver operating characteristics and calculation of the area under the curve (AUC); and (4) feature selection and the rank of importance of conditioning factors using the learning vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm. In order to achieve this aim, first, a landslide inventory map with 146 disaster locations was prepared using national reports and field monitoring, and landslide locations were divided into a training (70% = 102) and validating (30% = 44) data set. Then, 12 landslide conditioning factors, such as aspect, altitude, drainage density, distance from faults, lithology, slope, land use, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance from rivers, distance from roads, and the topographic wetness index, were selected as input layers for the \{LSM\} in the Chahardangeh Watershed. In the next step, the \{EBF\} model was used to consider the relationship between landslide locations and the aforementioned conditioning factors. Subsequently, three GIS-based machine learning algorithms were applied for landslide susceptibility mapping, and their results were validated using \{AUC\} values. Finally, the \{LVQ\} algorithm was applied for feature selection and importance determination of different conditioning factors. The results showed that the \{RF\} model had the highest \{AUC\} value (83.3%), followed by the SVM, and the \{NB\} with \{AUC\} values of 75.7% and 72.5%, respectively. Also, the results of the \{LVQ\} model revealed that altitude, the distance from the road, lithology, and land use have the most effects on landslide occurrence, respectively. So, the landslide susceptibility maps can be used for land use planning, and the management of landslide hazards in this study area. "}

Machine-learning (ML) algorithms exist that learn, extract, identify and map underlying patterns to identify groupings of depressed individuals without constraints. The aim of this research was to use a large epidemiological study to identify and characterise depression clusters through “Graphing lifestyle-environs using machine-learning methods” (GLUMM). Methods Two \{ML\} algorithms were implemented: unsupervised Self-organised mapping (SOM) to create \{GLUMM\} clusters and a supervised boosted regression algorithm to describe clusters. Ninety-six “lifestyle-environ” variables were used from the National health and nutrition examination study (2009–2010). Multivariate logistic regression validated clusters and controlled for possible sociodemographic confounders. Results The \{SOM\} identified two \{GLUMM\} cluster solutions. These solutions contained one dominant depressed cluster (GLUMM5-1, GLUMM7-1). Equal proportions of members in each cluster rated as highly depressed (17%). Alcohol consumption and demographics validated clusters. Boosted regression identified GLUMM5-1 as more informative than GLUMM7-1. Members were more likely to: have problems sleeping; unhealthy eating; ≤ 2 years in their home; an old home; perceive themselves underweight; exposed to work fumes; experienced sex at ≤ 14 years; not perform moderate recreational activities. A positive relationship between GLUMM5-1 (OR: 7.50, P &lt; 0.001) and GLUMM7-1 (OR: 7.88, P &lt; 0.001) with depression was found, with significant interactions with those married/living with partner (P = 0.001). Conclusion Using \{ML\} based \{GLUMM\} to form ordered depressive clusters from multitudinous lifestyle-environ variables enabled a deeper exploration of the heterogeneous data to uncover better understandings into relationships between the complex mental health factors.

Our goal was to establish simple and objective metrics which can be used to differentiate between normal and pathological movement. In a small-scale clinical trial, 44 age-matched subjects were divided in two groups, namely 20 healthy subjects (H), and 24 Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. We applied a comprehensive machine learning approach to build a model that could classify unknown subjects based on their line-drawing performance. We were able to achieve an average prediction accuracy of 91% (88% sensitivity [ΤP], 95% specificity [ΤN]). Our results show that the proposed method is a good candidate for differentiating between healthy and Parkinson’s disease individuals, and shows promise in the context of telemedicine applications and tracking of the disease’s symptoms via inexpensive, widely available hardware.

This paper proposes and evaluates a fast classifier, extreme learning machine (ELM), to classify individual and combined finger movements on amputees and non-amputees. \{ELM\} is a single hidden layer feed-forward network (SLFN) that avoids iterative learning by determining input weights randomly and output weights analytically. Therefore, it can accelerate the training time of SLFNs. In addition to the classifier evaluation, this paper evaluates various feature combinations to improve the performance of M-PR and investigate some feature projections to improve the class separability of the features. Different from other studies on the implementation of \{ELM\} in the myoelectric controller, this paper presents a complete and thorough investigation of various types of \{ELMs\} including the node-based and kernel-based ELM. Furthermore, this paper provides comparisons of \{ELMs\} and other well-known classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbour (kNN), support vector machine (SVM) and least-square \{SVM\} (LS-SVM). The experimental results show the most accurate \{ELM\} classifier is radial basis function \{ELM\} (RBF-ELM). The comparison of RBF-ELM and other well-known classifiers shows that RBF-ELM is as accurate as \{SVM\} and LS-SVM but faster than the \{SVM\} family; it is superior to \{LDA\} and kNN. The experimental results also indicate that the accuracy gap of the M-PR on the amputees and non-amputees is not too much with the accuracy of 98.55% on amputees and 99.5% on the non-amputees using six electromyography (EMG) channels.

We propose that \{ML\} models can be used as upper bounds for the “explainable” variance in a given data set and thus serve as upper bounds for the potential power of a theory. We demonstrate this method in the domain of uncertainty. We ask over 600 individuals to make a total of 6000 choices with randomized parameters and compare standard economic models to \{ML\} models. In the domain of risk, a version of expected utility that allows for non-linear probability weighting (as in cumulative prospect theory) and individual-level parameters performs as well out-of-sample as \{ML\} techniques. By contrast, in the domain of ambiguity, two of the most widely studied models (a linear version of maximin preferences and second order expected utility) fail to compete with the \{ML\} methods. We open the “black boxes” of the \{ML\} methods and show that under risk we “rediscover” expected utility with probability weighting. However, in the case of ambiguity the form of ambiguity aversion implied by our \{ML\} models suggests that there is gain from theoretical work on a portable model of ambiguity aversion. Our results highlight ways in which behavioral scientists can incorporate \{ML\} techniques in their daily practice to gain genuinely new insights. "}

A Quad-Core \{CPU\} 1.8 \{GHz\} laptop computer served as hardware platform. Almeida's Python program was used to construct the \{ELM\} regression model to map polymetallic prospectivity of the Lalingzaohuo district in Qinghai Province in China. Based on geologic, metallogenic, and statistical analyses of the study area, one target and eight predictor map patterns and two training sets were then used to train the \{ELM\} regression and logistic regression models. \{ELM\} regression modeling using the two training sets spends 61.4 s and 65.9 s; whereas the logistic regression modeling using the two training sets spends 1704.0 s and 1628.0 s. The four trained regression models were used to map polymetallic prospectivity. Based on the polymetallic prospectivity predicted by each model, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted and the area under the curve (AUC) was estimated. The \{ROC\} curves show that the two ELM-regression-based models somewhat dominate the two logistic-regression-based models over the \{ROC\} performance space; and the \{AUC\} values indicate that the overall performances of the two ELM-regression-based models are somewhat better than those of the two logistic-regression-based models. Hence, the ELM-regression-based models slightly outperform the logistic-regression-based models in mapping polymetallic prospectivity. Polymetallic targets were optimally delineated by using the Youden index to maximize spatial association between the delineated polymetallic targets and the discovered polymetallic deposits. The polymetallic targets predicted by the two ELM-regression-based models occupy lower percentage of the study area (2.66–2.68%) compared to those predicted by the two logistic-regression-based models (4.96%) but contain the same percentage of the discovered polymetallic deposits (82%). Therefore, the \{ELM\} regression is a useful fast-learning data-driven model that slightly outperforms the widely used logistic regression model in mapping mineral prospectivity. The case study reveals that the magmatic complexes, which intruded into the Baishahe Formation of the Paleoproterozoic Jinshuikou Group or the Carboniferous Dagangou and Shiguaizi Formations, and which were controlled by northwest-western/east-western trending deep faults, are critical for polymetallic mineralization and need to be paid much attention to in future mineral exploration in the study area.

Lattice networks have been used in the past to visually depict \{DNA\} and protein sequences, but they are very flexible. In fact, we can use this technique to create string pseudofolding lattice representations for any kind of string data. In this work, we carried out a statistical analysis of 50,000+ cases to seek and validate a new quantitative structure–activity relationship–like predictor for enzyme subclasses using a machine learning approach. The model uses spectral moments, entropy, and mean potential of pseudofolding lattice graphs as inputs. In this work we report the five best models that we found. "}

It could enable early interventions to prevent complications, enabling more efficient utilization of manpower and facilities in hospitals. In this study, we apply a regression tree (Cubist) model for predicting the LOS, based on static inputs, that is, values that are known at the time of admission and that do not change during patient's hospital stay. The model was trained and validated on de-identified administrative data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals in Pittsburgh, PA. We chose to use a Cubist model because it produced more accurate predictions than did alternative techniques. In addition, tree models enable us to examine the classification rules learned from the data, in order to better understand the factors that are most correlated with hospital LOS. Cubist recursively partitions the data set as it estimates linear regressions for each partition, and the error level differs for different partitions, so that it is possible to deduce what are the characteristics of patients whose \{LOS\} can be accurately predicted at admission, and what are the characteristics of patients for whom the \{LOS\} estimate at that point in time is more highly uncertain. For example, our model indicates that the prediction error is greater for patients who had more admissions in the recent past, and for those who had longer previous hospital stays. Our approach suggests that mapping the cases into a higher dimensional space, using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, helps to separate them by their level of Cubist error, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Because of concept drift, traditional data mining techniques cannot be directly applied in data streams environment. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), comparing with the traditional neural network (e.g. \{BP\} network), \{ELM\} has a faster speed, so it is very suitable for real-time data processing. In order to deal with the challenge in data streams classification, a new approach based on extreme learning machine is proposed in this paper. The approach utilizes \{ELMs\} as base classifiers and adaptively decides the number of the neurons in hidden layer, in addition, activation functions are also randomly selected from a series of functions to improve the performance of the approach. Finally, the algorithm trains a series of classifiers and the decision results for unlabeled data are made by weighted voting strategy. When the concept in data streams keeps stable, every classifier is incrementally updated by using new data; if concept drift is detected, the classifiers with weak performance will be cleared away. In the experiment, we used 7 artificial data sets and 9 real data sets from \{UCI\} repository to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The testing results showed, comparing with the conventional classification methods for data streams such as ELM, BP, \{AUE2\} and Learn++.MF, on most data sets, the new approach could not only be simplest in the structure, but also get a higher and more stable accuracy with lower time consuming.

Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective at detecting known and unknown malware in various domains, however, to the best of our knowledge, machine learning methods have not been used for the detection of malicious XML-based Office documents (*.docx, *.xlsx, *.pptx, *.odt, *.ods, etc.). In this paper we present a novel structural feature extraction methodology (SFEM) for XML-based Office documents. \{SFEM\} extracts discriminative features from documents, based on their structure. We leveraged SFEM’s features with machine learning algorithms for effective detection of malicious *.docx documents. We extensively evaluated \{SFEM\} with machine learning classifiers using a representative collection (16,938 *.docx documents collected "from the wild") which contains ∼4.9% malicious and ∼95.1% benign documents. We examined 1,600 unique configurations based on different combinations of feature extraction, feature selection, feature representation, top-feature selection methods, and machine learning classifiers. The results show that machine learning algorithms trained on features provided by \{SFEM\} successfully detect new unknown malicious *.docx documents. The Random Forest classifier achieves the highest detection rates, with an \{AUC\} of 99.12% and true positive rate (TPR) of 97% that is accompanied by a false positive rate (FPR) of 4.9%. In comparison, the best anti-virus engine achieves a \{TPR\} which is ∼25% lower. "}

In this paper, we examine different machine learning approaches to use situational features associated with having or not having urges to smoke during a quit attempt in order to accurately classify high-urge states. Methods To test our machine learning approaches, specifically, Bayes, discriminant analysis and decision tree learning methods, we used a dataset collected from over 300 participants who had initiated a quit attempt. The three classification approaches are evaluated observing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision. Results The outcome of the analysis showed that algorithms based on feature selection make it possible to obtain high classification rates with only a few features selected from the entire dataset. The classification tree method outperformed the naive Bayes and discriminant analysis methods, with an accuracy of the classifications up to 86%. These numbers suggest that machine learning may be a suitable approach to deal with smoking cessation matters, and to predict smoking urges, outlining a potential use for mobile health applications. Conclusions In conclusion, machine learning classifiers can help identify smoking situations, and the search for the best features and classifier parameters significantly improves the algorithms' performance. In addition, this study also supports the usefulness of new technologies in improving the effect of smoking cessation interventions, the management of time and patients by therapists, and thus the optimization of available health care resources. Future studies should focus on providing more adaptive and personalized support to people who really need it, in a minimum amount of time by developing novel expert systems capable of delivering real-time interventions.

Results The cohort was affected by \{PG\} mean reduction of 23.7 ± 8.8%. During the first 3 weeks, 86.7% cases show \{PG\} deformation aligned with predefined tolerance, thus not requiring re-planning. From 4th week, an increased number of pts would potentially benefit from re-planning: a mean of 58% of cases, with an inter-center variability of 8.3%, showed “inadequate” conditions. 11% of cases showed “bias” due to \{DIR\} and script failure; 6% showed “warning” output due to potential positioning issues. Comparing re-planning suggested by tool with recommended by ROs, the 4th week seems the most favorable time in 70% cases. Conclusions \{SVM\} and decision-making tool was applied to overcome \{ART\} challenges.

Three machine-learning models were applied to predict the top 10% of included articles in terms of the number of citations to the article in 2014 (reflecting the 2-year time window in conventional impact factor calculations). The model having the highest area under the curve was selected to derive a list of article features (words) predicting high citation volume, which was iteratively reduced to identify the smallest possible core feature list maintaining predictive power. Overall themes were qualitatively assigned to the core features. Results The regularized logistic regression (Bayesian binary regression) model had highest performance, achieving an area under the curve of 0.814 in predicting articles in the top 10% of citation volume. We reduced the initial 14,083 features to 210 features that maintain predictivity. These features corresponded with topics relating to various imaging techniques (eg, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging, dual-energy computed tomography, computed tomography reconstruction algorithms, tomosynthesis, elastography, and computer-aided diagnosis), particular pathologies (prostate cancer; thyroid nodules; hepatic adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), and other topics (radiation dose, electroporation, education, general oncology, gadolinium, statistics). Conclusions Machine learning can be successfully applied to create specific feature-based models for predicting articles likely to achieve high influence within the radiological literature. "}

Several tongue colour quantification methods have been published to objectify clinical information among East Asian countries. However, reliable tongue colour analysis results among Japanese test persons are limited because of a lack of quantitative evaluation of tongue colour. We aimed to use advances in digital imaging processing to quantify and verify clinical data tongue colour diagnosis by characterising differences intongue features. Methods The DS01-B tongue colour information acquisition system was used to extract tongue images of 1080 Japanese test subjects. Evaluation of tongue colour, body and coating was performed by 10 experienced Kampo medicine physicians. The acquired images were classified into five tongue body colour categories and six tongue coating colour categories based on evaluations from 10 physicians with extensive Kampo medicine experience. K-means clustering algorithm was applied as a machine learning (the study of pattern recognition by computational learning) method to the acquired images to quantify tongue body and coating colour information. Results Tongue body (n = 550) and tongue coating (n = 516) colour samples were classified and analysed. Clusters consisting of five tongue body colour categories and six tongue coating colour categories were experimentally described in the \{CIELAB\} colour space. Statistical differences were evident among the clinically primary tongue colours. Conclusions Clinically important tongue colour differences in Kampo medicine can be visualised by applying machine learning to tongue images taken under stable conditions. This has implications for developing globally unified, reliable tongue colour diagnostic criteria which could be used to explore the relevance between clinical status and tongue colour. "}

Defect prediction models can be developed using software metrics in combination with defect data for predicting defective classes. Various studies have been conducted to find the relationship between software metrics and defect proneness, but there are few studies that statistically determine the effectiveness of the results. Objective The main objectives of the study are (i) comparison of the machine-learning techniques using data sets obtained from popular open source software (ii) use of appropriate performance measures for measuring the performance of defect prediction models (iii) use of statistical tests for effective comparison of machine-learning techniques and (iv) validation of models over different releases of data sets. Method In this study we use object-oriented metrics for predicting defective classes using 18 machine-learning techniques. The proposed framework has been applied to seven application packages of well known, widely used Android operating system viz. Contact, MMS, Bluetooth, Email, Calendar, Gallery2 and Telephony. The results are validated using 10-fold and inter-release validation methods. The reliability and significance of the results are evaluated using statistical test and post-hoc analysis. Results The results show that the area under the curve measure for Naïve Bayes, LogitBoost and Multilayer Perceptron is above 0.7 in most of the cases. The results also depict that the difference between the \{ML\} techniques is statistically significant. However, it is also proved that the Support Vector Machines based techniques such as Support Vector Machines and voted perceptron do not possess the predictive capability for predicting defects. Conclusion The results confirm the predictive capability of various \{ML\} techniques for developing defect prediction models. The results also confirm the superiority of one \{ML\} technique over the other \{ML\} techniques. Thus, the software engineers can use the results obtained from this study in the early phases of the software development for identifying defect-prone classes of given software. "}

Methods for predicting \{SWC\} that have simple data requirements are needed to achieve an optimal irrigation schedule, especially for various water-saving irrigation strategies that are required to resolve both food and water security issues under conditions of water shortages. Thus, a two-year field investigation was carried out to provide a dataset to compare the effectiveness of HYDRUS-2D, a physically-based numerical model, with various machine-learning models, including Multiple Linear Regressions (MLR), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for simulating time series of \{SWC\} data under water stress conditions. \{SWC\} was monitored using \{TDRs\} during the maize growing seasons of 2010 and 2011. Eight combinations of six, simple, independent parameters, including pan evaporation and average air temperature as atmospheric parameters, cumulative growth degree days (cGDD) and crop coefficient (Kc) as crop factors, and water deficit (WD) and irrigation depth (In) as crop stress factors, were adopted for the estimation of \{SWCs\} in the machine-learning models. Having Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) in the range of 0.54–2.07 mm, HYDRUS-2D ranked first for the \{SWC\} estimation, while the \{ANFIS\} and \{SVM\} models with input datasets of cGDD, Kc, \{WD\} and In ranked next with \{RMSEs\} ranging from 1.27 to 1.9 mm and mean bias errors of −0.07 to 0.27 mm, respectively. However, the \{MLR\} models did not perform well for \{SWC\} forecasting, mainly due to non-linear changes of \{SWCs\} under the irrigation process. The results demonstrated that despite requiring only simple input data, the \{ANFIS\} and \{SVM\} models could be favorably used for \{SWC\} predictions under water stress conditions, especially when there is a lack of data. However, process-based numerical models are undoubtedly a better choice for predicting \{SWCs\} with lower uncertainties when required data are available, and thus for designing water saving strategies for agriculture and for other environmental applications requiring estimates of SWCs.

Advance knowledge of the soil bearing capacity is crucial for heavy machinery operations. Especially peatland areas can cause severe problems for harvesting operations and can result in increased costs. In addition to avoiding potential damage to the soil, route planning must also take into consideration the root damage to the remaining trees. In this paper we study the predictability of boreal soil load bearing capacity by using remote sensing data and field measurement data. We conduct our research by using both linear and nonlinear methods of machine learning. With the best prediction method, ridge regression, the results are promising with a C-index value higher than 0.68 up to 200 m prediction range from the closest point with known bearing capacity, the baseline value being 0.5. The load bearing classification of the soil resulted in 76% accuracy up to 60 m by using a multilayer perceptron method. The results indicate that there is a potential for production applications and that there is a great need for automatic real-time sensoring in order to produce applicable predictions. "}

abstract = {"AbstractObject Our purpose was to develop a new machine-learning approach (a virtual health check-up) toward identification of those at high risk of hyperuricemia. Applying the system to general health check-ups is expected to reduce medical costs compared with administering an additional test. Methods Data were collected during annual health check-ups performed in Japan between 2011 and 2013 (inclusive). We prepared training and test datasets from the health check-up data to build prediction models; these were composed of 43,524 and 17,789 persons, respectively. Gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR) approaches were trained using the training dataset and were then used to predict hyperuricemia in the test dataset. Undersampling was applied to build the prediction models to deal with the imbalanced class dataset. Results The results showed that the \{RF\} and \{GBDT\} approaches afforded the best performances in terms of sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the models, which reflected the total discriminative ability of the classification, were 0.796 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.766–0.825] for the GBDT, 0.784 [95% CI: 0.752–0.815] for the RF, and 0.785 [95% CI: 0.752–0.819] for the \{LR\} approaches. No significant differences were observed between pairs of each approach. Small changes occurred in the \{AUCs\} after applying undersampling to build the models. Conclusions We developed a virtual health check-up that predicted the development of hyperuricemia using machine-learning methods. The GBDT, RF, and \{LR\} methods had similar predictive capability. Undersampling did not remarkably improve predictive power. "}

The main goal was to analyze the efficiency of the developed system for health monitoring of the bridge mechanical components such as gearbox, motor and rack and pinion. To this aim, Sunrise Movable Bridge in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida was selected and instrumented. A comprehensive database was collected from the sensors installed on the mechanical and structural components of the Sunrise Bridge for about 4 years. The collected data were utilized to assess the performance of the algorithm under baseline and different common damage scenarios. Based on the results, the proposed health monitoring system has a satisfactory performance for the detection of the damage scenarios caused by leakage and lack of sufficient oil in gearbox, as well as bolt removal from rack and pinion.

Here, a sequential processing feature extraction method and a novel multiplicative extreme learning machine are proposed for using in the electroencephalogram (EEG) classification process towards epileptic seizure detection. Firstly, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) algorithm based on the frequency decomposition is used to obtain the sub-band wavelet coefficients. Secondly, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) phase space reconstruction (PSR) of the sub-band are calculated to reveal the nonlinear chaos characteristics of signals in the high dimension. Thirdly, and differing from other statistical methods, the singular values are calculated based on the covariance matrix of 2D or 3D phase space as features that reduce the correlation of each dimension and which demonstrate the crucial variance in the original \{EEG\} signals. A combination of the proposed sequential methods can extract the significant features of epileptic seizure signals for classification. Finally, a novel multiplicative extreme learning machine (M-ELM) is proposed for using in the classification process. As compared with the normal ELM, support vector machine (SVM) with different kernels and backpropagation (BP) neural networks, the use of M-ELM can further improve the classification accuracy rate of the seizure signals, seizure free signals and healthy signals from the public dataset. Tests of the proposed epilepsy detection approach can achieve the highest 100% detection accuracy with rapid calculation speed. "}

The proposed algorithm chooses samples making more contribution to target function to constitute kernel dictionary meanwhile considering all the constraints generated by the whole training set. As a result it can simplify model structure and realize sparseness of K-ELM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that no matter for regression or classification problems, RR-KELM produces more compact model structure and higher real-time in comparison with other methods. The application of RR-KELM for aero-engine fault pattern recognition is also given in this paper. The simulation results demonstrate that RR-KELM has a high recognition rate on aero-engine fault pattern based on measurable parameters of aero-engine. "}

A system of differential equations is used to compute the model based compensation values. The model can predict thermal displacements of the tool center point (TCP) based on changes in the environmental temperature, load-dependent changes and boundary condition changes and states, like machining with or without cutting fluid. The model based compensation of the rotary axis of a 5-axis \{MT\} is then extended by on-machine measurements. The information gained by the process-intermittent probing is used to adaptively update the model parameters, so that the model learns how to predict thermal position and orientation errors and to maintain a small residual error of the thermally induced errors of the rotary axis over a long time. This approach not only increases the \{MT\} accuracy but also reduces the amount of time spent on preproduction model parameter identification. Additionally an algorithm has been developed to dynamically adjust the length of the on-machine measurement intervals to maintain a high productivity and a constant deviation of the machined parts. Experimental results confirm that the adaptive learning control (ALC) for thermal errors shows a desirable long-term prediction accuracy. "}

A decision tree learning environment is selected to capture the relationships between microstructure and twin formation; this type of model effectively highlights the more influential characteristics of the local microstructure. Trees are assembled to analyze both twin nucleation in a given grain, and twin propagation across grain boundaries. Each model reveals a unique combination of crystallographic attributes that affect twinning in the Mg. Twin nucleation is found to be mostly controlled by a combination of grain size, basal Schmid factor, and bulk dislocation density while twin propagation is affected most by grain boundary length, basal Schmid factor, angle from grain boundary plane to the \{RD\} plane, and grain boundary misorientation. The machine learning framework can be readily adapted to investigate other relationships between microstructure and material response. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Numerical weather forecasts, such as meteorological forecasts of precipitation, are inherently uncertain. These uncertainties depend on model physics as well as initial and boundary conditions. Since precipitation forecasts form the input into hydrological models, the uncertainties of the precipitation forecasts result in uncertainties of flood forecasts. In order to consider these uncertainties, ensemble prediction systems are applied. These systems consist of several members simulated by different models or using a single model under varying initial and boundary conditions. However, a too wide uncertainty range obtained as a result of taking into account members with poor prediction skills may lead to underestimation or exaggeration of the risk of hazardous events. Therefore, the uncertainty range of model-based flood forecasts derived from the meteorological ensembles has to be restricted. In this paper, a methodology towards improving flood forecasts by weighting ensemble members according to their skills is presented. The skill of each ensemble member is evaluated by comparing the results of forecasts corresponding to this member with observed values in the past. Since numerous forecasts are required in order to reliably evaluate the skill, the evaluation procedure is time-consuming and tedious. Moreover, the evaluation is highly subjective, because an expert who performs it makes his decision based on his implicit knowledge. Therefore, approaches for the automated evaluation of such forecasts are required. Here, we present a semi-automated approach for the assessment of precipitation forecast ensemble members. The approach is based on supervised machine learning and was tested on ensemble precipitation forecasts for the area of the Mulde river basin in Germany. Based on the evaluation results of the specific ensemble members, weights corresponding to their forecast skill were calculated. These weights were then successfully used to reduce the uncertainties within rainfall-runoff simulations and flood risk predictions. "}

Various digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques have been applied in many parts of the world to improve availability and usability of soil data, but less has been done in Africa, particularly in Tanzania and at the scale necessary to make farm management decisions. The Kilombero Valley has been identified for intensified rice production. However the valley lacks detailed and up-to-date soil information for decision-making. The overall objective of this study was to develop a predictive soil map of a portion of Kilombero Valley using \{DSM\} techniques. Two widely used decision tree algorithms and three sources of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were evaluated for their predictive ability. Firstly, a numerical classification was performed on the collected soil profile data to arrive at soil taxa. Secondly, the derived taxa were spatially predicted and mapped following \{SCORPAN\} framework using Random Forest (RF) and \{J48\} machine learning algorithms. Datasets to train the model were derived from legacy soil map, RapidEye satellite image and three DEMs: 1 arc SRTM, 30 m ASTER, and 12 m WorldDEM. Separate predictive models were built using each \{DEM\} source. Mapping showed that \{RF\} was less sensitive to the training set sampling intensity. Results also showed that predictions of soil taxa using 1 arc \{SRTM\} and 12 m WordDEM were identical. We suggest the use of \{RF\} algorithm and the freely available \{SRTM\} \{DEM\} combination for mapping the soils for the whole Kilombero Valley. This combination can be tested and applied in other areas which have relatively flat terrain like the Kilombero Valley. "}

Existing multi-view clustering works generally integrate multiple complementary information to gain better clustering performance rather than relying on a single view. However, these works usually focus on the combination of information rather than improving the feature representation capability of each view. As a new method, extreme learning machine (ELM) has excellent feature representation capability, easy parameter selection, and promising performance in various clustering tasks. This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering framework with \{ELM\} to further improve clustering performance, and implements three algorithms based on this framework. In this framework, the normalized features of each individual view are mapped onto a higher dimensional feature space by the \{ELM\} random mapping. Afterwards, the unsupervised multi-view clustering is performed in this feature space. Thus far, this is the first work on multi-view clustering with ELM. Numerous baseline methods on five real-world datasets are empirically compared to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. As indicated, the proposed algorithms yield superior clustering performance when compared with several state-of-art multi-view clustering methods in recent literatures. "}

The growth of L. chinensis was shown to be limited by either nitrogen, phosphorus, or both during different stages of degradation. The soil chemistry changed noticeably as degradation aggravated, which represents a destabilization of L. chinensis community homeostasis. Soil salinization aggravates soil nutrient loss and decreases the bioavailability of soil nutrients. This, along with the destabilization of C/N, C/P and N/P ratios, weakens the photosynthetic ability and productivity of L. chinensis. This conclusion was supported by observations that L. chinensis is gradually being replaced by a Chloris virgata, Puccinellia tenuiflora and Suaeda acuminate mixed community. "}

This is very hard, since traffic congestion is normally increasing. As a result, bus travel times are higher and less reliable, which makes harder to predict travel times and avoid bunching. Being able to accurately predict bus travel speeds and update this prediction with real-time information could improve the quality and reliability of the information given to users, and increase the effectiveness of control schemes. In this work we implement and compare different machine learning methods (Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Bayes Networks) to predict bus travel speeds using real-time information about traffic conditions. The proposed algorithms are compared against two common approaches used to predict travel speeds. In order to feed our models, we apply traffic shockwaves theory to select our predictors. The input data used in each model was the speed obtained and processed from \{GPS\} devices installed in each of the buses from Transantiago, the public transportation system from Santiago, Chile. Two types of speed were available: historical speed and a real-time speed, each for a given route segment and day period. Our results show that machine learning algorithms can outperform naïve predictions that use either only historical data or only real-time data with a 10-min delay. In particular, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm achieved the best results, obtaining improvements of up to 23% in the root mean square error (RMSE) compared with the best benchmark model, and up to 3.3% in the \{RMSE\} versus the second best machine learning algorithm studied. Moreover, we validated our hypothesis that real-time data helps improve the accuracy of predictions up to 35% in the RMSE. "}

This paper explores the potential of big data and big data analytics in the light of current approaches to measuring streetscape features. By applying machine learning algorithms on Google Street View imagery, we generated objectively three measures on visual enclosure. The results showed that sky areas were identified fairly well for the calculation of proportion of sky. The three visual enclosure measures were found to be correlated with pedestrian volume and Walk Score. This method allows large scale and consistent objective measures of visual enclosure that can be done reproducibly and universally applicable with readily available Google Street View imagery in many countries around the world to help test their association with walking behaviors.

We developed a molecular source tracking test using the PhyloChip microarray that detects and distinguishes fecal bacteria from humans, birds, ruminants, horses, pigs and dogs with a single test. The multiplexed assay targets 9001 different 25-mer fragments of 16S rRNA genes that are common to the bacterial community of each source type. Both random forests and SourceTracker were tested as discrimination tools, with SourceTracker classification producing superior specificity and sensitivity for all source types. Validation with 12 different mammalian sources in mixtures found 100% correct identification of the dominant source and 84–100% specificity. The test was applied to identify sources of fecal indicator bacteria in the Russian River watershed in California. We found widespread contamination by human sources during the wet season proximal to settlements with antiquated septic infrastructure and during the dry season at beaches during intense recreational activity. The test was more sensitive than common fecal indicator tests that failed to identify potential risks at these sites. Conversely, upstream beaches and numerous creeks with less reliance on onsite wastewater treatment contained no fecal signal from humans or other animals; however these waters did contain high counts of fecal indicator bacteria after rain. Microbial community analysis revealed that increased E. coli and enterococci at these locations did not co-occur with common fecal bacteria, but rather co-varied with copiotrophic bacteria that are common in freshwaters with high nutrient and carbon loading, suggesting runoff likely promoted the growth of environmental strains of E. coli and enterococci. These results indicate that machine-learning classification of PhyloChip microarray data can outperform conventional single marker tests that are used to assess health risks, and is an effective tool for distinguishing numerous fecal and environmental sources of pathogen indicators.

From the functional equivalence between the \{SLFN\} and fuzzy inference system, a hybrid of fuzzy-ELM has gained attention of the researchers. This paper extends the concept of fuzzy-ELM to an \{IT2FLS\} based on \{ELM\} (IT2FELM). In the proposed design the antecedent membership function parameters of the \{IT2FLS\} are generated randomly, whereas the consequent part parameters are determined analytically by the Moore–Penrose pseudo inverse. The \{ELM\} strategy ensures fast learning of the \{IT2FLS\} as well as optimality of the parameters. Effectiveness of the proposed design of \{IT2FLS\} is demonstrated with the application of forecasting nonlinear and chaotic data sets. Nonlinear data of electricity load from the Australian National Electricity Market for the Victoria region and from the Ontario Electricity Market are considered here. The proposed model is also applied to forecast Mackey-glass chaotic time series data. Comparative analysis of the proposed model is conducted with some traditional models such as neural networks (NN) and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). In order to verify the structure of the proposed design of \{IT2FLS\} an alternate design of \{IT2FLS\} based on Kalman filter (KF) is also utilized for the comparison purposes. "}

Managers focus on continuous effort for increasing profits and reducing cost in their organization. In the past two decades, the price of raw materials has fluctuated severely and steel plants found it hard to earn profits and keep the capacity normal. Whereas some steel plants reduced the overcapacity of production by revamping the blast furnace or cutting down the throughput, others tried to limit and eliminate unnecessary cost. However, these strategies have failed to keep pace with the frequent changes in the raw material prices and could not support the profit targets greatly. This study aims at addressing such concerns by proposing an extreme learning machine (ELM) to predict the major raw material price in steel plants. Typically, this paper focuses on integration of Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) with a hybrid forecasting model to forecast the cost of iron ore and coking coal that are majorly used in steel plants. Here we attempt to establish a dynamic cost system to forecast the manufacturing cost of end products and adjust the purchasing and production strategy. This forecasting model can offer an accurate and rapidly predicting result of raw material price. Managers can use this forecasting results to reconsider the purchasing of raw materials and adjust the pricing strategy to pursuit their company’s profit targets. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Shrinking size of transistors has enabled us to integrate more and more logic elements into \{FPGA\} chips leading to higher computing power. However, it also brings a serious concern to the leakage power dissipation of the \{FPGA\} devices. One of the major reasons for leakage power dissipation in \{FPGA\} is the utilization of prefetching technique to minimize the reconfiguration overhead (delay) in Partially Reconfigurable (PR) FPGAs. This technique creates delays between the reconfiguration and execution parts of a task, which may lead up to 38% leakage power of \{FPGA\} since the SRAM-cells containing reconfiguration information cannot be powered down. In this work, a resource management approach (RMA) containing scheduling, placement and post-placement stages has been proposed to address the aforementioned issue. In scheduling stage, a leakage-aware priority function is derived to cope with the leakage power. The placement stage uses a cost function that allows designers to determine the desired trade-off between performance and leakage-saving. The post-placement stage employs a heuristic approach to close the gaps between reconfiguration and execution of tasks, hence further reduce leakage waste. To further examine the trade-off between performance (schedule length) and leakage waste, we propose a framework to utilize the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for exploring the design space and obtaining Pareto optimal design points. Addressing the time-consuming limitation of GA, we apply Regression technique and Clustering algorithm to build predictive models for the Pareto fronts using a training task graph dataset. Experiments show that our approach can achieve large leakage savings for both synthetic and real-life applications with acceptable extended deadline. Furthermore, different variants of the proposed approach can reduce leakage power by 40–65% when compared to a performance-driven approach and by 15–43% when compared to state-of-the-art works. It’s also proven that our Machine Learning Optimization framework can estimate the Pareto front for new coming task graphs 10x faster than well-established \{GA\} approach with only 10% degradation in quality.

abstract = {"AbstractObjective After swallowing, the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) needs a certain amount of time to return from maximum pressure to the resting condition. Disturbances of sphincter function not only during the swallowing process but also in this phase of pressure restitution may lead to globus sensation or dysphagia. Since \{UES\} pressures do not decrease in a linear or asymptotic manner, it is difficult to determine the exact time when the resting pressure is reached, even when using high resolution manometry (HRM). To overcome this problem a Machine Learning model was established to objectively determine the \{UES\} restitution time (RT) and moreover to collect physiological data on sphincter function after swallowing. Methods and material HRM-data of 15 healthy participants performing 10 swallows each were included. After manual annotation of the \{RT\} interval by two swallowing experts, data were transferred to the Machine Learning model, which applied a sequence labeling modeling approach based on logistic regression to learn and objectivize the characteristics of all swallows. Individually computed \{RT\} values were then compared with the annotated values. Results Estimates of the \{RT\} were generated by the Machine Learning model for all 150 swallows. When annotated by swallowing experts mean \{RT\} of 11.16 s ± 5.7 (SD) and 10.04 s ± 5.74 were determined respectively, compared to model-generated values from 8.91 s ± 3.71 to 10.87 s ± 4.68 depending on model selection. The correlation score for the annotated \{RT\} of both examiners was 0.76 and 0.63 to 0.68 for comparison of model predicted values. Conclusions Restitution time represents an important physiologic swallowing parameter not previously considered in HRM-studies of the UES, especially since disturbances of \{UES\} restitution may increase the risk of aspiration. The data presented here show that it takes approximately 9 to 11 s for the \{UES\} to come to rest after swallowing. Based on maximal \{RT\} values, we demonstrate that an interval of 25–30 s in between swallows is necessary until the next swallow is initiated. This should be considered in any further HRM-studies designed to evaluate the characteristics of individual swallows. The calculation model enables a quick and reproducible determination of the time it takes for the \{UES\} to come to rest after swallowing (RT). The results of the calculation are partially independent of the input of the investigator. Adding more swallows and integrating additional parameters will improve the Machine Leaning model in the future. By applying similar models to other swallowing parameters of the pharynx and UES, such as the relaxation time of the \{UES\} or the activity time during swallowing, a complete automatic evaluation of HRM-data of a swallow should be possible.

The algorithm searches throughout the space of binary coded input variables by iteratively optimizing the objective function in each dimension at a time.

Our experimental datasets are distinct in terms of the number of attributes (ranging from 18 to 11,340), and the number of classes (binary or multi-class classification). The efficiency in terms of the number of subset evaluations was improved substantially (by factors of 5–37) compared with two popular \{FSS\} meta-heuristics, i.e., sequential forward selection (SFS) and sequential floating forward selection (SFFS), while the classification performance for unseen data was maintained.

The motivation for exploring and developing expert predictive models is an ongoing endeavor for hydrological applications. In this study, the potential of a relatively new data-driven method, namely the extreme learning machine (ELM) method, was explored for forecasting monthly stream-flow discharge rates in the Tigris River, Iraq. The \{ELM\} algorithm is a single-layer feedforward neural network (SLFNs) which randomly selects the input weights, hidden layer biases and analytically determines the output weights of the SLFNs. Based on the partial autocorrelation functions of historical stream-flow data, a set of five input combinations with lagged stream-flow values are employed to establish the best forecasting model. A comparative investigation is conducted to evaluate the performance of the \{ELM\} compared to other data-driven models: support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The forecasting metrics defined as the correlation coefficient (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS), Willmott’s Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) computed between the observed and forecasted stream-flow data are employed to assess the \{ELM\} model’s effectiveness. The results revealed that the \{ELM\} model outperformed the \{SVR\} and the \{GRNN\} models across a number of statistical measures. In quantitative terms, superiority of \{ELM\} over \{SVR\} and \{GRNN\} models was exhibited by \{ENS\} = 0.578, 0.378 and 0.144, r = 0.799, 0.761 and 0.468 and \{WI\} = 0.853, 0.802 and 0.689, respectively and the \{ELM\} model attained lower \{RMSE\} value by approximately 21.3% (relative to SVR) and by approximately 44.7% (relative to GRNN). Based on the findings of this study, several recommendations were suggested for further exploration of the \{ELM\} model in hydrological forecasting problems. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Extreme learning machine (ELM) has emerged as an efficient and effective learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. Most of the existing research on the \{ELMs\} mainly focus on supervised learning. Recently, researchers have extended \{ELMs\} for semi-supervised learning, in which they exploit both the labeled and unlabeled data in order to enhance the learning performances. They have incorporated Laplacian regularization to determine the geometry of the underlying manifold. However, Laplacian regularization lacks extrapolating power and biases the solution towards a constant function. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called Hessian semi-supervised \{ELM\} (HSS-ELM) to enhance the semi-supervised learning of ELM. Unlike the Laplacian regularization, the Hessian regularization that favors functions whose values vary linearly along the geodesic distance and preserves the local manifold structure well. This leads to good extrapolating power. Furthermore, HSS-ELM maintains almost all the advantages of the traditional \{ELM\} such as the significant training efficiency and straight forward implementation for multiclass classification problems. The proposed algorithm is tested on publicly available data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms in term of accuracy. Additionally, HSS-ELM requires remarkably less training time compared to semi-supervised SVMs/regularized least-squares methods. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Computer vision and machine learning methods were applied to the challenge of automatic microstructure recognition. Here, a case study on dendritic morphologies was performed. Two classification tasks were completed, and involved distinguishing between micrographs that depict dendritic morphologies from those that do not contain this particular microstructural feature (Task 1), and from those micrographs identified as depicting dendrites, different cross-sectional views (longitudinal or transverse) were identified (Task 2). Data sets were comprised of images taken over a range of magnifications, from materials with different compositions and varying orientations of microstructural features. Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction were performed prior to training machine learning algorithms to classify microstructural image data. Visual bag of words, texture and shape statistics, and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (deep learning algorithms) were used for feature extraction. Classification was then performed using support vector machine, voting, nearest neighbors, and random forest models. For each model, classification was completed using full (original size) and reduced feature vectors for each feature extraction method tested. Performance comparisons were done to evaluate all possible combinations of feature extraction, selection, and classifiers for the task of micrograph classification. Results demonstrate that pre-trained neural networks represent microstructure image data well, and when used for feature extraction yield the highest classification accuracies for the majority of classifier and feature selection methods tested. Thus, deep learning algorithms can successfully be applied to micrograph recognition tasks. Maximum classification accuracies of 91.85 ± 4.25% and 97.37 ± 3.33% for Tasks 1 and 2 respectively, were achieved. This work is a broad investigation of computer vision and machine learning methods that acts as a step towards applying these established methods to more sophisticated materials recognition or characterization tasks. The approach presented here could offer improvements over established stereological measurements by removing the requirement of expert knowledge (bias) for interpretation of image data prior to characterization.

The innovation of this study is to use multilevel-ROI-features-based machine learning method to detect sensitive morphometric biomarkers in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Specifically, the low-level \{ROI\} features (gray matter volume, cortical thickness, etc.) and high-level correlative features (connectivity between ROIs) are integrated to make the multilevel \{ROI\} features. Filter- and wrapper- based feature selection methods and multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) are used in the classification algorithm. T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance (MR) images of 69 \{PD\} patients and 103 normal controls from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset are included in the study. The machine learning method performs well in classification between \{PD\} patients and normal controls with an accuracy of 85.78%, a specificity of 87.79%, and a sensitivity of 87.64%. The most sensitive biomarkers between \{PD\} patients and normal controls are mainly ROI-based features in frontal lobe, parental lobe, limbic lobe, temporal lobe, and central region. The classification performance of our method with multilevel \{ROI\} features is significantly improved compared with other classification methods: using single-level features. The proposed method shows promising identification ability for detecting morphometric biomarkers in PD, thus confirming the potentiality of this method in assisted diagnosis of the disease. "}

In this study, we used both sensor-level and source-level features extracted from \{EEG\} signals recorded during an auditory oddball task for the classification of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. \{EEG\} signals were recorded from 34 patients with schizophrenia and 34 healthy controls while each subject was asked to attend to oddball tones. Our results demonstrated higher classification accuracy when source-level features were used together with sensor-level features, compared to when only sensor-level features were used. In addition, the selected sensor-level features were mostly found in the frontal area, and the selected source-level features were mostly extracted from the temporal area, which coincide well with the well-known pathological region of cognitive processing in patients with schizophrenia. Our results suggest that our approach would be a promising tool for the computer-aided diagnosis of schizophrenia. "}

Then, based on extreme learning machine, the mapping relation model is constructed from lower resolution \{NMR\} images with higher noise to higher resolution \{NMR\} images with lower noise in each pair of adjacent images in the obtained image sequence.

Finally, a test datum is assigned to the most suitable cluster identified according to the result of combining five linkage methods. The constructed \{ELM\} model corresponding to the identified cluster is utilized to perform the final prediction.

abstract = {"Abstract Flood forecasting in natural rivers is a complicated procedure because of uncertainties involved in the behaviour of the flood wave movement. This leads to complex problems in hydrological modelling which have been widely solved by soft computing techniques. In real time flood forecasting, data generation is continuous and hence there is a need to update the developed mapping equation frequently which increases the computational burden. In short term flood forecasting where the accuracy of flood peak value and time to peak are critical, frequent model updating is unavoidable. In this paper, we studied a new technique: Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) which is capable of updating the model equation based on new data entry without much increase in computational cost. The OS-ELM was explored for use in flood forecasting on the Neckar River, Germany. The reach was characterized by significant lateral flow that affected the flood wave formation. Hourly data from 1999–2000 at the upstream section of Rottweil were used to forecast flooding at the Oberndorf downstream site with a lead time of 1–6 h. Model performance was assessed by using three evaluation measures: the coefficient of determination (R2), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). The performance of the OS-ELM was comparable to those of other widely used Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques like support vector machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Programming (GP). The frequent updating of the model in OS-ELM gave a closer reproduction of flood events and peak values with minimum error compared to SVM, \{ANN\} and GP. "}

Apart from being time consuming, such work is highly subjective and through visual inspection alone, a quantitative analysis is highly unlikely to be made. This study investigates the applicability of various Machine Learning techniques for the automatic classification of the seabed into maerl and sand regions from recorded \{ROV\} footage. \{ROV\} data collected from depths ranging between 50 m and 140 m and at 9.5 km from the northeast coastline of the Maltese Islands, is processed.

An estimate for the percentage cover of the two benthic habitats (sandy seabed and maerl) was also computed by using artifacts encountered during the \{ROV\} survey and of known dimensions as a reference. Unlike other automatic seabed mapping techniques, the presented prototype processes video footage captured by a down-facing camera and not through acoustic backscatter. Image data is easier and much cheaper to capture. Promising results that indicate a very good degree of agreement between the true and predicted habitat type distribution values, were obtained. "}

Moreover, it can efficiently incorporate the known group label proportions with the latent unknown observation labels into one optimization model under a large-margin framework. Compared to the existing approaches, there are several advantages shown as follows: 1) it does not need to make restrictive assumptions on the training data; 2) nonparallel classifiers can be achieved without computing the large inverse matrices; 3) the optimization model can be effectively solved by using the alternative strategy with \{SMO\} technique or \{SOR\} method; 4) proportion-NPSVM has better generalization ability. Sufficient experimental results on both binary-classes and multi-classes data sets show the efficiency of our proposed method in classification accuracy, which prove the state-of-the-art method for \{LLP\} problems compared with competing algorithms.

Given that sleep scoring requires expert knowledge, it is generally undertaken by sleep experts. In this study, a new hybrid machine learning method consisting of complex-valued nonlinear features (CVNF) and a complex-valued neural network (CVANN) has been presented for automatic sleep scoring using single channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals. First of all, we should note that in this context, nine nonlinear features have been obtained as those are often preferred for the classification of \{EEG\} signals. These obtained features were then converted into a complex-valued number format using a phase encoding method. In this way, a new complex-valued feature set was obtained for sleep scoring. The obtained attributes have been presented as input to the \{CVANN\} algorithm. We have used a number of different statistical parameters during the evaluation process. The results that have been obtained are based on two sleep standards: Rechtschaffen &amp; Kales (R&amp;K) and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). Finally, a 91.57% accuracy rate was obtained according to R&amp;K standard; a 93.84% accuracy rate was obtained according to the \{AASM\} standard using the proposed method.

In this paper, the performance of a robust hybrid approach, composed of a Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm and a new class of neural network called Extreme Learning Machine, is discussed. The Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm is focused on obtaining the most relevant features among the set of initial ones, by including an exponential prediction model. While previous approaches consider that the number of macroeconomic variables used for prediction is a parameter of the algorithm (i.e., it is fixed a priori), the proposed Variable Neighborhood Search method optimizes both: the number of variables and the best ones. After this first step of feature selection, an Extreme Learning Machine network is applied to obtain the final energy demand prediction. Experiments in a real case of energy demand estimation in Spain show the excellent performance of the proposed approach. In particular, the whole method obtains an estimation of the energy demand with an error lower than 2%, even when considering the crisis years, which are a real challenge. "}

A feature selection procedure was implemented to select the most significant combination of cell shape metrics to build classifiers with both accuracy and stability to identify and predict microenvironment-driven morphological differences in heterogeneous cell populations. The analysis was conducted at a multi-cell level, where a “supercell” method used average shape measurements of small groups of single cells to account for heterogeneous populations and microenvironment. A subsampling validation algorithm revealed the range of supercell sizes and sample sizes needed for classifier stability and generalization capability. As an example, the responses of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) to fibrous vs flat microenvironments were compared on day 1. Our analysis showed that 57 cells (grouped into supercells of size 4) are the minimum needed for phenotyping. The analysis identified that a combination of minor axis length, solidity, and mean negative curvature were the strongest early shape-based indicator of hBMSCs response to fibrous microenvironment.

This study developed a novel time-series sliding window metaheuristic optimization-based machine learning system for predicting real-time building energy consumption data collected by a smart grid. The proposed system integrates a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and metaheuristic firefly algorithm-based least squares support vector regression (MetaFA-LSSVR) model. Specifically, the proposed system fits the \{SARIMA\} model to linear data components in the first stage, and the MetaFA-LSSVR model captures nonlinear data components in the second stage. Real-time data retrieved from an experimental smart grid installed in a building were used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed system. A k-week sliding window approach is proposed for employing historical data as input for the novel time-series forecasting system. The prediction system yielded high and reliable accuracy rates in 1-day-ahead predictions of building energy consumption, with a total error rate of 1.181% and mean absolute error of 0.026 kW h. Notably, the system demonstrates an improved accuracy rate in the range of 36.8–113.2% relative to those of the linear forecasting model (i.e., SARIMA) and nonlinear forecasting models (i.e., \{LSSVR\} and MetaFA-LSSVR). Therefore, end users can further apply the forecasted information to enhance efficiency of energy usage in their buildings, especially during peak times. In particular, the system can potentially be scaled up for using big data framework to predict building energy consumption. "}

Although construction research has considered machine learning (ML) for more than two decades, it had yet to be applied to safety concerns. We applied two state-of-the-art \{ML\} models, Random Forest (RF) and Stochastic Gradient Tree Boosting (SGTB), to a data set of carefully featured attributes and categorical safety outcomes, extracted from a large pool of textual construction injury reports via a highly accurate Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool developed by past research. The models can predict injury type, energy type, and body part with high skill (0.236 &lt; \{RPSS\} &lt; 0.436), outperforming the parametric models found in the literature. The high predictive skill reached suggests that injuries do not occur at random, and that therefore construction safety should be studied empirically and quantitatively rather than strictly being approached through the analysis of subjective data, expert opinion, and with a regulatory and managerial perspective. This opens the gate to a new research field, where construction safety is considered an empirically grounded quantitative science. Finally, the absence of predictive skill for the output variable injury severity suggests that unlike other safety outcomes, injury severity is mainly random, or that extra layers of predictive information should be used in making predictions, like the energy level in the environment. In the context of construction safety analysis, this study makes important strides in that the results provide reliable probabilistic forecasts of likely outcomes should an accident occur, and show great potential for integration with building information modeling and work packaging due to the binary and physical nature of the input variables. Such data-driven predictions had been absent from the field since its inception. "}

Energy audit mandates, such as New York City (NYC)’s Local Law 87 (LL87), require energy consultants to analyze installed building systems and provide building stakeholders with cost effective \{ECM\} recommendations on a multi-year cycle. However, complete audits are costly and time consuming. To accelerate \{ECM\} implementation, policymakers are exploring ways to utilize available data to target \{ECMs\} across a city’s entire building stock. In this study, energy audit data for over 1100 buildings in NYC, submitted in compliance with LL87, are analyzed to identify opportunities for \{ECMs\} across building system categories (e.g. distribution system, domestic hot water, etc.). A machine learning classifier, specifically a user-facing falling rule list (FRL) classifier based on binary features derived from \{LL87\} data, is developed here to predict \{ECM\} eligibility given a specific set of building characteristics. Overall, the trained \{FRL\} classifier performs well (ROC \{AUC\} 0.72–0.86) for predicting cooling system, distribution system, domestic hot water, fuel switching, lighting, and motors \{ECM\} opportunities, which represent a majority of the auditor-recommended \{ECMs\} in the sample. Additionally, linear decision lists developed by the model allow building stakeholders to easily conduct streamlined audits of building systems and identify possible \{ECM\} opportunities by limiting input to the most relevant factors and prioritizing likely retrofit candidates. The implications of this work are significant in accelerating the adoption of building \{ECMs\} and catalyzing energy use and \{GHG\} emissions reductions from buildings. "}

In this work, we fabricate a multisensor: three-axis \{LIM\} force sensor with integrated temperature and ambient irradiance sensing manufactured via a monolithic, origami-inspired fabrication process called printed-circuit MEMS. We explore machine learning regression techniques to compensate for temperature and ambient light sensitivity using on-board environmental sensor data.

By augmenting the least-squares estimate with nonlinear functions describing both environmental disturbances and cross-axis coupling effects, we can reduce the error in Fx, Fy and Fz by 10%, 33%, and 73%, respectively. We assess viability of each algorithm tested in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational overhead, and analyze kernel-based regression for prediction in the context of online force feedback and haptics applications in surgical robotics.

Those two methods, however, have their respective drawbacks, e.g., in general, \{ELM\} is known to be less robust to noise while \{SRC\} is known to be time-consuming. Consequently, \{ELM\} and \{SRC\} complement each other in computational complexity and classification accuracy. In order to unify such mutual complementarity and thus further enhance the classification performance, we propose an efficient hybrid classifier to exploit the advantages of \{ELM\} and \{SRC\} in this paper. More precisely, the proposed classifier consists of two stages: first, an \{ELM\} network is trained by supervised learning. Second, a discriminative criterion about the reliability of the obtained \{ELM\} output is adopted to decide whether the query image can be correctly classified or not. If the output is reliable, the classification will be performed by ELM; otherwise the query image will be fed to SRC. Meanwhile, in the stage of SRC, a sub-dictionary that is adaptive to the query image instead of the entire dictionary is extracted via the \{ELM\} output. The computational burden of \{SRC\} thus can be reduced. Extensive experiments on handwritten digit classification, landmark recognition and face recognition demonstrate that the proposed hybrid classifier outperforms \{ELM\} and \{SRC\} in classification accuracy with outstanding computational efficiency.

The reliability of the computational model was accessed based on simulation results and using five statistical tests including mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD), root-mean-square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and coefficient of determination (R2). The validity of \{ELM\} modelled \{ET0\} are compared with the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation (ET0,PM) which is used as the reference model. For the Belgrade and Nis stations, the ET0,AHARG \{ELM\} model with \{MAPE\} = 9.353 and 10.299%, \{MAD\} = 0.142 and 0.151 mm/day, \{RMSE\} = 0.180 and 0.192 mm/day, r = 0.994 and 0.992, \{R2\} = 0.988 and 0.984 in testing period, was found to be superior in modelling monthly \{ET0\} than the other models, respectively.

abstract = {"Abstract In many scientific fields, empirical models are employed to facilitate computational simulations of engineering systems. For example, in fluid mechanics, empirical Reynolds stress closures enable computationally-efficient Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations. Likewise, in solid mechanics, constitutive relations between the stress and strain in a material are required in deformation analysis. Traditional methods for developing and tuning empirical models usually combine physical intuition with simple regression techniques on limited data sets. The rise of high performance computing has led to a growing availability of high fidelity simulation data. These data open up the possibility of using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests or neural networks, to develop more accurate and general empirical models. A key question when using data-driven algorithms to develop these empirical models is how domain knowledge should be incorporated into the machine learning process. This paper will specifically address physical systems that possess symmetry or invariance properties. Two different methods for teaching a machine learning model an invariance property are compared. In the first method, a basis of invariant inputs is constructed, and the machine learning model is trained upon this basis, thereby embedding the invariance into the model. In the second method, the algorithm is trained on multiple transformations of the raw input data until the model learns invariance to that transformation. Results are discussed for two case studies: one in turbulence modeling and one in crystal elasticity. It is shown that in both cases embedding the invariance property into the input features yields higher performance at significantly reduced computational training costs. "}

Outliers are the data points that differ greatly from the pattern set by the bulk of the data. Inspired by this fact, Hsieh et al. introduced the Wilcoxon approach into the area of machine learning. They investigated four new learning machines, such as Wilcoxon neural network (WNN), and developed four gradient descent based backpropagation algorithms to train these learning machines. The performances of these machines are better than ordinary nonrobust neural networks in outliers exist tasks. However, it is hard to balance the learning speed and the stability of these algorithms which is inherently the drawback of gradient descent based algorithms. In this paper, a new algorithm is used to train the output weights of single-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN) with input weights and biases being randomly chosen. This algorithm is called Wilcoxon-norm based robust extreme learning machine or \{WRELM\} for short. "}

It is about learning multiple levels of representation and abstraction that help to make sense of data such as images, sound, and text. One deep model often consists of a hierarchical architecture that has the capability to model super non-linear and stochastic problems. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is the main constructing block of current deep networks, as most of deep architectures are built with it. Based on MapReduce framework and Hadoop distributed file system, this paper proposes a distributed algorithm for training the \{RBM\} model. Its implementation and performance are evaluated on Big Data platform-Hadoop. The main contribution of the new learning algorithm is that it solves the scalability problem that limits the development of deep learning. The intelligence growing process of human brain requires learning from Big Data. The distributed learning mechanism for \{RBM\} makes it possible to abstract sophisticated and informative features from Big Data to achieve high-level intelligence. The evaluations of the proposed learning algorithm are carried out on image inpainting and classification problems based on the \{BAS\} dataset and \{MNIST\} hand-written digits dataset. "}

Instead, contrastive divergence (CD) learning has been developed as an approximation of \{ML\} learning and widely used in practice. To clarify the performance of \{CD\} learning, in this paper, we analytically derive the fixed points where \{ML\} and \{CD\} n learning rules converge in two types of RBMs: one with Gaussian visible and Gaussian hidden units and the other with Gaussian visible and Bernoulli hidden units. In addition, we analyze the stability of the fixed points. As a result, we find that the stable points of \{CD\} n learning rule coincide with those of \{ML\} learning rule in a Gaussian–Gaussian RBM. We also reveal that larger principal components of the input data are extracted at the stable points. Moreover, in a Gaussian–Bernoulli RBM, we find that both \{ML\} and \{CD\} n learning can extract independent components at one of stable points. Our analysis demonstrates that the same feature components as those extracted by \{ML\} learning are extracted simply by performing \{CD\} 1 learning. Expanding this study should elucidate the specific solutions obtained by \{CD\} learning in other types of \{RBMs\} or in deep networks. "}

By replacing the so-called \{ELM\} feature mappings with the nonlinear mappings induced by kernel functions, two kernel ELMs, i.e., P-KELM and D-KELM, are obtained from primal and dual perspectives, respectively. Unfortunately, both P-KELM and D-KELM possess the dense solutions in direct proportion to the number of training data. To this end, a constructive algorithm for P-KELM (CCP-KELM) is first proposed by virtue of Cholesky factorization, in which the training data incurring the largest reductions on the objective function are recruited as significant vectors. To reduce its training cost further, PCCP-KELM is then obtained with the application of a probabilistic speedup scheme into CCP-KELM. Corresponding to CCP-KELM, a destructive P-KELM (CDP-KELM) is presented using a partial Cholesky factorization strategy, where the training data incurring the smallest reductions on the objective function after their removals are pruned from the current set of significant vectors. Finally, to verify the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed algorithms in this paper, experiments on both small and large benchmark data sets are investigated. "}

In this investigation, based on least-squares estimate (LSE) and least absolute deviation (LAD), we propose four sparse \{ELM\} formulations with zero-norm regularization to automatically choose the optimal hidden nodes. Furthermore, we develop two continuous optimization methods to solve the proposed problems respectively. The first is \{DC\} (difference of convex functions) approximation approach that approximates the zero-norm by a \{DC\} function, and the resulting optimizations are posed as \{DC\} programs. The second is an exact penalty technique for zero-norm, and the resulting problems are reformulated as \{DC\} programs, and the corresponding \{DCAs\} converge finitely. Moreover, the proposed framework is applied directly to recognize the hardness of licorice seeds using near-infrared spectral data. Experiments in different spectral regions illustrate that the proposed approaches can reduce the number of hidden nodes (or output features), while either improve or show no significant difference in generalization compared with the traditional \{ELM\} methods and support vector machine (SVM). Experiments on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed framework is competitive with the traditional approaches in generalization, but selects fewer output features. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Technical and quantitative analysis in financial trading use mathematical and statistical tools to help investors decide on the optimum moment to initiate and close orders. While these traditional approaches have served their purpose to some extent, new techniques arising from the field of computational intelligence such as machine learning and data mining have emerged to analyse financial information. While the main financial engineering research has focused on complex computational models such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, there are also simpler models that have demonstrated their usefulness in applications other than financial trading, and are worth considering to determine their advantages and inherent limitations when used as trading analysis tools. This paper analyses the role of simple machine learning models to achieve profitable trading through a series of trading simulations in the \{FOREX\} market. It assesses the performance of the models and how particular setups of the models produce systematic and consistent predictions for profitable trading. Due to the inherent complexities of financial time series the role of attribute selection, periodic retraining and training set size are discussed in order to obtain a combination of those parameters not only capable of generating positive cumulative returns for each one of the machine learning models but also to demonstrate how simple algorithms traditionally precluded from financial forecasting for trading applications presents similar performances as their more complex counterparts. The paper discusses how a combination of attributes in addition to technical indicators that has been used as inputs of the machine learning-based predictors such as price related features, seasonality features and lagged values used in classical time series analysis are used to enhance the classification capabilities that impacts directly into the final profitability.

Volatility forecasting of China Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) has a very important theoretical and practical significance for financial asset pricing and financial risk measure or management. However, \{IBOR\} is a dynamics and non-steady time series whose developmental changes have stronger random fluctuation, so it is difficult to forecast the volatility of IBOR. This paper offers a hybrid algorithm using grey model and extreme learning machine (ELM) to forecast volatility of IBOR. The proposed algorithm is composed of three phases. In the first, grey model is used to deal with the original \{IBOR\} time series by accumulated generating operation (AGO) and weaken the stochastic volatility in original series. And then, a forecasting model is founded by using \{ELM\} to analyze the new \{IBOR\} series. Lastly, the predictive value of the original \{IBOR\} series can be obtained by inverse accumulated generating operation (IAGO). The new model is applied to forecasting Interbank Offered Rate of China. Compared with the forecasting results of \{BP\} and classical ELM, the new model is more efficient to forecasting short- and middle-term volatility of IBOR. "}

The analysis shows that recent techniques such as Gradient Boosted Trees and Support Vector Regression are up to two times more efficient than the ones typically encountered in the literature (Multiple Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Networks). If goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy remain crucial to assess the performance of a model, other criteria such as computational cost, easiness to train or interpretability should be considered when selecting a statistical method for estimating the manufacturing cost of mechanical parts. Ideally, cost estimators should rely on several statistical models concurrently, as their distinct characteristics yield complementary views on the drivers of manufacturing cost. Finally, some engineering insights revealed by the statistical analysis are presented. They include the ranking and quantification of the most important cost drivers, the approximation of the economic production function of component cost according to accumulated production volume and a different view on the traditional breakdown of manufacturing cost of some jet engine components. As a conclusion, Machine Learning appears to be an effective, affordable, accurate and scalable technique to cost mechanical parts in the early stage of the design process. "}

An improper process model will be time consuming, error-prone and cost expensive, and further lower the quality of software. Therefore, how to choose an appropriate software process model is a very important problem for software development. Current works focus on the selection criteria and often lead to subjective results. In this paper, we propose a software process model recommendation method, to help project managers choose the most appropriate software process model for a new project at an early stage of development process according to historical software engineering data. The proposed method casts the process model recommendation into a classification problem. It first evaluates the different combinations of the alternative classification and attribute selection algorithms, and the best one is used to build the recommendation model with historical software engineering data; then, the constructed recommendation model is used to predict process models for a new software project with only a few data. We also analyze the mutual impacts between process models and different types of project factors, to further help managers locate the most suitable process model. We found process models are also responsible for defect count, defect severity and software change. Experiments on the data sets from 37 different development teams of different countries show that the average recommendation accuracy of our method reaches up to 82.5%, which makes it potentially useful in practice.

In ELM, the hidden neurons are randomly assigned and the output layer weights are learned in a single step using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse. This approach results in a fast learning neural network algorithm with a single hyperparameter (the number of hidden neurons). Despite the aforementioned advantages, using \{ELM\} can result in models with a large number of hidden neurons and this can lead to poor generalization. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel method to prune hidden layer neurons based on genetic algorithms (GA). The proposed approach, referred as GAP-ELM, selects subset of the hidden neurons to optimize a multiobjective fitness function that defines a compromise between accuracy and the number of pruned neurons. The performance of GAP-ELM is assessed on several real world datasets and compared to other \{SLFN\} and a well known pruning method called Optimally Pruned \{ELM\} (OP-ELM). On the basis of our experiments, we can state that GAP-ELM is a valid alternative for classification tasks. "}

In this paper, a fast H.264/AVC to High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) transcoding method based on machine learning is proposed by considering the similarity between compressed streams, especially the block partition correlations, to reduce the computational complexity. This becomes possible by constructing three-level binary classifiers to predict quad-tree Coding Unit (CU) partition in HEVC. Then, we propose a feature selection algorithm to get representative features to improve predication accuracy of the classification. In addition, we propose an adaptive probability threshold determination scheme to achieve a good trade-off between low coding complexity and high compression efficiency during the \{CU\} depth prediction in HEVC. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed transcoder achieves complexity reduction of 50.2% and 49.2% on average under lowdelay P main and random access configurations while the rate-distortion degradation is negligible. The proposed scheme is proved more effective as comparing with the state-of-the-art benchmarks. "}

This paper proposes to apply extreme learning machine to multipath ultrasonic flowmeters, which can analytically determine the output weights of networks instead of error backpropagation algorithm and iterative tuning of the parameters, and therefore provide high metering accuracy at extremely fast learning speed as well as require least human intervention. To test its effectiveness under different flow field and sensitivity to complex flow profiles, extreme learning machine is applied to determine the flow rate under two piping configurations, which can produce mild and severe flow disturbances. The determination errors are compared with a traditional integration method on the position of 5D and 10D as well as with the path orientation of 0° and 90°. Then 7 installation angles and 9 installation positions are respectively configured to study the performance and sensitivity of \{UFMs\} to installation effects. Finally, a comparison between extreme learning machine and other two intelligent algorithms is made in training and test time, the mean squared error and the maximal metering error under severe flow disturbance. It is found that extreme learning machine has rather high determination accuracy for flow rate at extremely fast learning speed and it is insensitive to the installation effects of ultrasonic gas flowmeter.

Methods Network connectivity measures derived from 62-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording were used to identify selected features within two infant groups who differed on \{LLD\} risk: infants with a family history of \{LLD\} (FH+) and typically-developing infants without such a history (FH−). A support vector machine was deployed; global efficiency and global and local clustering coefficients were computed. A novel minimum spanning tree (MST) approach was also applied. Cross-validation was employed to assess the resultant classification. Results Infants were classified with about 80% accuracy into FH+ and FH− groups with 89% specificity and precision of 92%. Clustering patterns differed by risk group and \{MST\} network analysis suggests that FH+ infants’ \{EEG\} complexity patterns were significantly different from FH− infants. Conclusions The automatic classification techniques used here were shown to be both robust and reliable and should provide valuable information when applied to early identification of risk or clinical groups. Significance The ability to identify infants at highest risk for \{LLD\} using “automatic classification” strategies is a novel convergent approach that may facilitate earlier diagnosis and remediation.

This study classified 1029 PARAFAC-analyzed excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) measured using \{DOM\} isolated from 24 different leaf leachates, rivers, and organic matter standards using four machine learning methods (MLM). \{EEMs\} were also divided into subsets to assess the impact of experimental treatments (i.e. whole EEMs, size fractionation, mixtures, quenching) and dataset properties (i.e. different numbers of \{EEMs\} from each leachate/river) on classification. A split-half validated, 10-component \{PARAFAC\} model was extended to 12 components to remove consistent peaks evident in model residuals. The 12-component model performed better than the 10-component model, correctly classifying up to 80 additional EEMs, when the dataset included size-fractionated \{DOM\} or several different sources (i.e. many leaf species and rivers); however, the 10-component model performed better for whole-sample \{EEMs\} when comparing leaf leachates to rivers. The \{MLM\} correctly classified whole \{EEMs\} of riverine \{DOM\} by source with up to 87.0% accuracy, leachates with up to 92.5% accuracy, and distinguished leachates from rivers with 97.2% accuracy. A difference of up to 17.3% in classification accuracy was observed depending on the \{MLM\} method used with the following order: multilayer perceptron = support vector machine &gt; k-nearest neighbours ≫ decision tree; however, performances differed widely depending on the data subset. Classification accuracy for whole and size-fractionated rivers compared to whole and size-fractionated leachates using N-way partial least-squares discriminant analysis (NPLS-DA; 97.7%) was similar to that achieved using MLM. Combining \{MLM\} with \{PARAFAC\} is an effective method for classifying \{DOM\} based on its fluorescence signature because \{PARAFAC\} can isolate meaningful fluorescent species and unlike PLSDA, \{MLM\} constructs a single model which simultaneously classifies \{EEMs\} as belonging to one of several categories. A complete accounting of carbon flows through ecosystems should include the processes and sources that contribute to the disparate fluorescence signatures of riverine and leached DOM. "}

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to handle incomplete data with voting based extreme learning machine (V-ELMI). V-ELMI did not rely on any assumptions about missing values. It first obtains a group of data subsets according to the missing values of the training set. Then, it applies mutual information to measure the importance degree of each data subsets. After that, it trains a group of subclassifiers on these data subsets by applying \{ELM\} as base learning algorithm. Finally, for a given test sample with missing values, V-ELMI selects the subclassifiers whose input did not require the missing values to predict it. And final prediction is determined by weighted majority voting according to the mean value of the norms of the output weights and the importance degree of each available subclassifier. Experimental results on 15 \{UCI\} incomplete datasets and 5 \{UCI\} complete datasets have shown that, V-ELMI generally has better performance than the algorithms compared. Moreover, compared with the classification algorithms based on neural network ensemble (NNE), V-ELMI can greatly improve algorithm computational efficiency. "}

In order to model the uncertainty of fuzzy model parameters such as processing time and learning effect, we use an approach called as likelihood profile that dependent on the possibility and necessity measures of fuzzy parameters. For three objective functions, we build Fuzzy Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (FMINP) models those are dependent chance constrained programming technique for the same predetermined confidence levels. Furthermore, we present polynomially solvable algorithms for different confidence levels for these problems. "}

Spam causes various problems that may, in turn, cause economic losses. Spam causes traffic problems and bottlenecks that limit memory space, computing power and speed. Spam causes users to spend time removing it. Various methods have been developed to filter spam, including black list/white list, Bayesian classification algorithms, keyword matching, header information processing, investigation of spam-sending factors and investigation of received mails. This study describes three machine-learning algorithms to filter spam from valid emails with low error rates and high efficiency using a multilayer perceptron model. Several widely used techniques include C4.5 decision tree classifier, multilayer perceptron and Naïve Bayes classifier, all of which are used for training data whether in the form of spam or valid emails. Finally, the results are discussed, and outputs of considered techniques are examined in relation to the proposed model. "}

Unfortunately, it is an extremely tedious method and has rarely been deployed in practical applications. In this paper, a highly efficient Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) formula has been developed and integrated with the popular Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (RELM). The main contribution of this paper is the proposed algorithm, termed as Efficient LOO-CV-based \{RELM\} (ELOO-RELM), that can effectively and efficiently update the LOO-CV error with every regularization parameter and automatically select the optimal model with limited user intervention. Rigorous analysis of computational complexity shows that the ELOO-RELM, including the tuning process, can achieve similar efficiency as the original \{RELM\} with pre-defined parameter, in which both scale linearly with the size of the training data. An early termination criterion is also introduced to further speed up the learning process. Experimentation studies on benchmark datasets show that the ELOO-RELM can achieve comparable generalization performance as the Support Vector Machines (SVM) with significantly higher learning efficiency. More importantly, comparing to the trial and error tuning procedure employed by the original RELM, the ELOO-RELM can provide more reliable results by the virtue of incorporating the LOO-CV procedure.

Machine learning paradigm is adapted for risk stratification of psoriasis disease grades utilizing offline training and online testing images. We design four kinds of pRAS systems. It uses two kinds of classifiers (support vector machines (SVM) and decision tree (DT)) during training and testing phases and two kinds of feature selection criteria (Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR)), thus, leading to an exhaustive comparison between these four systems. Our database consisted of 848 psoriasis images with five severity grades: healthy, mild, moderate, severe and very severe, consisting of 383, 47, 245, 145, and 28 images respectively. The pRAS system computes 859 colored and grayscale image features. Using cross-validation protocol with K-fold procedure, the pRAS system utilizing the \{SVM\} with \{FDR\} combination with combined color and grayscale feature set gives an accuracy of 99.92%. Several performance evaluation parameters such as: feature retaining power, aggregated feature effect and system reliability is computed meeting our assumptions and hypothesis.

These relationships were then computationally applied to automatically classify 10,000 additional randomly sampled news records. The model was validated by randomly sampling 200 records and comparing human assessments of them to the computer assessments. Results The computer model correctly assessed the relevance of 86% of news records, the quality of 65% of records, and the sensationalism of 73% of records, as compared to human assessments. Overall, the scientific quality of \{SARS\} and \{H1N1\} news media coverage had potentially important shortcomings, but coverage was not too sensationalizing. Coverage slightly improved between the two pandemics. Conclusion Automated methods can evaluate news records faster, cheaper, and possibly better than humans.

To solve this problem, we define a feature space sensitive area, where the probability of having false positives is higher, and use a second classifier (unanimity k-NN) in this area to better filter errors and improve the decision-making process. We call this method Risk Area \{SVM\} (RA-SVM). We compare the RA-SVM to other state-of-the-art methods for low false positive classification using 33 standard datasets in the literature.

Penalised logistic regression, support vector classification and random forest classification (RFC) models were generated and compared. Internal validation was performed (with 100-iteration cross-validation), using multiple metrics, including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration slope, to assess performance. Associations between covariates and severe mucositis were explored using the models. Results The dose–volume-based models (standard) performed equally to those incorporating spatial information. Discrimination was similar between models, but the \{RFCstandard\} had the best calibration. The mean \{AUC\} and calibration slope for this model were 0.71 (s.d. = 0.09) and 3.9 (s.d. = 2.2), respectively. The volumes of oral cavity receiving intermediate and high doses were associated with severe mucositis. Conclusions The \{RFCstandard\} model performance is modest-to-good, but should be improved, and requires external validation.

To alleviate this problem, an online sequential learning algorithm for single hidden layer feedforward neural networks – the online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) – is automatically updated inexpensively as new data arrive (and the new data can then be discarded). \{OSELM\} was applied to forecast daily streamflow at two small watersheds in British Columbia, Canada, at lead times of 1–3 days. Predictors used were weather forecast data generated by the \{NOAA\} Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS), and local hydro-meteorological observations. \{OSELM\} forecasts were tested with daily, monthly or yearly model updates. More frequent updating gave smaller forecast errors, including errors for data above the 90th percentile. Larger datasets used in the initial training of \{OSELM\} helped to find better parameters (number of hidden nodes) for the model, yielding better predictions. With the online sequential multiple linear regression (OSMLR) as benchmark, we concluded that \{OSELM\} is an attractive approach as it easily outperformed \{OSMLR\} in forecast accuracy. "}

Specifically a grouping genetic algorithm (GGA) and an Extreme Learning Machine algorithm (ELM) have been merged in a single algorithm, in such a way that the \{GGA\} solves the optimal selection of features, and the \{ELM\} carries out the prediction. The proposed scheme is also novel because it uses as input of the system the output of a numerical weather meso-scale model (WRF), i.e., atmospherical variables predicted by the \{WRF\} at different nodes. We consider then different problems associated with this general algorithmic framework: first, we evaluate the capacity of the GGA–ELM for carrying out a statistical downscaling of the \{WRF\} to a given point of interest (where a measure of solar radiation is available), i.e., we only take into account predictive variables from the \{WRF\} and the objective variable at the same time tag. In a second evaluation approach, we try to predict the solar radiation at the point of interest at different time tags t + x , using predictive variables from the WRF. Finally, we tackle the complete prediction problem by including previous values of measured solar radiation in the prediction. The proposed algorithm and its efficiency for selecting the best set of features from the \{WRF\} are analyzed in this paper, and we also describe different operators and dynamics for the GGA. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the system with these different characteristics in a real problem of solar radiation prediction at Toledo’s radiometric observatory (Spain), where the proposed system has shown an excellent performance in all the subproblems considered, in terms of different error metrics.

Moreover, achieved results indicate that developed \{ELM\} models can be used with confidence for further work on formulating novel model predictive strategy in district heating systems. The experimental results show that the new algorithm can produce good generalization performance in most cases and can learn thousands of times faster than conventional popular learning algorithms.

As a classifier, the \{SVM\} can create nonlinear decision boundaries to mitigate the distortions caused by nonlinear phase noise (NLPN). Without any prior information or heuristic assumptions, the \{SVM\} can learn and capture the link properties from only a few training data. Compared with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm, a lower bit-error rate (BER) is achieved by the \{SVM\} for a given launch power; moreover, the launch power dynamic range (LPDR) is increased by 3.3 dBm for 8 phase-shift keying (8 PSK), 1.2 dBm for QPSK, and 0.3 dBm for BPSK. The maximum transmission distance corresponding to a \{BER\} of 1 × 10 − 3 is increased by 480 km for the case of 8 PSK. The larger launch power range and longer transmission distance improve the tolerance to amplitude and phase noise, which demonstrates the feasibility of the \{SVM\} in digital signal processing for M-PSK formats. Meanwhile, in order to apply the \{SVM\} method to 16 quadratic amplitude modulation (16 QAM) detection, we propose a parameter optimization scheme. By utilizing a cross-validation and grid-search techniques, the optimal parameters of \{SVM\} can be selected, thus leading to the \{LPDR\} improvement by 2.8 dBm. Additionally, we demonstrate that the \{SVM\} is also effective in combating the laser phase noise combined with the inphase and quadrature (I/Q) modulator imperfections, but the improvement is insignificant for the linear noise and separate I/Q imbalance. The computational complexity of \{SVM\} is also discussed. The relatively low complexity makes it possible for \{SVM\} to implement the real-time processing. "}

The principle is to use a change detection mechanism to check if there is an abrupt change, and immediately train a new model if a change is detected. A novel online identification algorithm, namely initial-training-free online extreme learning machine (ITF-OELM), is also proposed to allow the model to be trained anytime without concerns on prior data. With this strategy, only one model is necessary as compared to MMAC, resulting in reduction on computational complexity and memory usage. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy is effective. Besides, although the use of forgetting factor in ITF-OELM can accelerate the convergence speed for system identification, sometimes it may lead to ill-conditioned covariance matrix in the recursively updating process. This paper shows that such issue can be solved by the change detection mechanism. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, affecting bone metabolism, structure and strength. Current bone assessment methods are not ideal. Semi-quantitative \{MRI\} scoring is unreliable, not standardized, and only evaluates bone marrow. \{DXA\} \{BMD\} is also used but is a limited predictor of bone fragility/fracture risk. Our purpose was to measure trabecular bone microarchitecture, as a biomarker of bone disease severity, in type 1 \{GD\} individuals with different \{GD\} genotypes and to apply machine learning based analytics to discriminate between \{GD\} patients and healthy individuals. Micro-MR imaging of the distal radius was performed on 20 type 1 \{GD\} patients and 10 healthy controls (HC). Fifteen stereological and textural measures (STM) were calculated from the \{MR\} images. General linear models demonstrated significant differences between \{GD\} and HC, and \{GD\} genotypes. Stereological measures, main contributors to the first two principal components (PCs), explained ~50% of data variation and were significantly different between males and females. Subsequent \{PCs\} textural measures were significantly different between \{GD\} patients and \{HC\} individuals. Textural measures also significantly differed between \{GD\} genotypes, and distinguished between \{GD\} patients with normal and pathologic \{DXA\} scores. \{PCA\} and \{SVM\} predictive analyses discriminated between \{GD\} and \{HC\} with maximum accuracy of 73% and area under \{ROC\} curve of 0.79. Trabecular \{STM\} differences can be quantified between \{GD\} patients and HC, and \{GD\} sub-types using micro-MRI and machine learning based analytics. Work is underway to expand this approach to evaluate \{GD\} disease burden and treatment efficacy. "}

Thus, \{MEKL\} is much easier than the conventional Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) in terms of processing and analyzing the structure of mapped feature spaces. However, the computational complexity of \{MEKL\} with M empirical feature spaces is O ( \{MN\} 3 ) where N is the number of training samples. The dimensions of the generated empirical feature spaces are approximate to N. When dealing with large-scale problems, \{MEKL\} cannot handle them properly due to the severe computation and memory burden. Moreover, most existing \{MEKL\} utilizes the gradient decent optimization to learn classifiers, but it is time consuming for training. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multiple Random Empirical Kernel Learning Machine (MREKLM) to overcome these problems. The proposed \{MREKLM\} adopts the random projection idea to map samples into multiple low-dimensional empirical feature spaces with lower computational complexity O ( \{MP\} 3 ) , where P ( ≪ N ) is the number of the randomly selected samples. After that, \{MREKLM\} adopts an analytical optimization approach to directly deal with multi-class problems. The computational complexity of \{MREKLM\} is O ( M 3 P 3 ) . Experimental results also validate both efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed MREKLM. The contributions of this work are: (1) proposing a fast \{MEKL\} algorithm named MREKLM, (2) introducing an efficient random empirical kernel mapping approach, and (3) extending the capability of \{MEKL\} to handle large-scale problems.

Benchmarks show that different docking programs can excel in individual benchmarks which suggests that the scoring function employed by the programs can be optimized for a particular task. Here the scoring function of Smina is re-optimized towards enhancing the docking power using a supervised machine learning approach and a manually curated database of ligands and cross docking receptor pairs. The optimization method does not need associated binding data for the receptor-ligand examples used in the data set and works with small train sets. The re-optimization of the weights for the scoring function results in a similar docking performance with regard to docking power towards a cross docking test set. A ligand decoy based benchmark indicates a better discrimination between poses with high and low RMSD. The reported parameters for Smina are compatible with Autodock Vina and represent ready-to-use alternative parameters for researchers who aim at pose prediction rather than affinity prediction. "}

However, some prior information, such as the local sensitive discriminant information among matrix-oriented patterns, might be neglected by MatCD. To overcome such flaw, a new regularization term named \{RLSD\} is adopted into MatCD by taking advantage of Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA) in this paper. In detail, the objective function of \{LSDA\} is modified and transformed into the regularization term \{RLSD\} to explore the local sensitive discriminant information among matrix-oriented patterns. In the implementation, \{RLSD\} is collaborated with one typical MatCD, whose name is Matrix-pattern-oriented Ho-Kashyap Classifier (MatMHKS), so as to create a new classifier based on local sensitive discriminant information named \{LSDMatMHKS\} for short. Finally, comprehensive experiments are designed to validate the effectiveness of LSDMatMHKS. The major contributions of this paper can be concluded as (1) improving the classification performance and the learning ability of MatCD, (2) introducing local sensitive discriminant information into MatCD and extending the application scenario of LSDA, and (3) validating and analyzing the feasibility and effectiveness of RLSD.

Electronic health data (EHD) are appealing sources of training data because they provide access to large amounts of rich individual-level data from present-day patient populations. However, because \{EHD\} are derived by extracting information from administrative and clinical databases, some fraction of subjects will not be under observation for the entire time frame over which one wants to make predictions; this loss to follow-up is often due to disenrollment from the health system. For subjects without complete follow-up, whether or not they experienced the adverse event is unknown, and in statistical terms the event time is said to be right-censored. Most machine learning approaches to the problem have been relatively ad hoc; for example, common approaches for handling observations in which the event status is unknown include (1) discarding those observations, (2) treating them as non-events, (3) splitting those observations into two observations: one where the event occurs and one where the event does not. In this paper, we present a general-purpose approach to account for right-censored outcomes using inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). We illustrate how \{IPCW\} can easily be incorporated into a number of existing machine learning algorithms used to mine big health care data including Bayesian networks, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and generalized additive models. We then show that our approach leads to better calibrated predictions than the three ad hoc approaches when applied to predicting the 5-year risk of experiencing a cardiovascular adverse event, using \{EHD\} from a large U.S. Midwestern healthcare system.

In order to run \{ML\} algorithms at such scales, on a distributed cluster with tens to thousands of machines, it is often the case that significant engineering efforts are required—and one might fairly ask whether such engineering truly falls within the domain of \{ML\} research. Taking the view that “big” \{ML\} systems can benefit greatly from ML-rooted statistical and algorithmic insights—and that \{ML\} researchers should therefore not shy away from such systems design—we discuss a series of principles and strategies distilled from our recent efforts on industrial-scale \{ML\} solutions. These principles and strategies span a continuum from application, to engineering, and to theoretical research and development of big \{ML\} systems and architectures, with the goal of understanding how to make them efficient, generally applicable, and supported with convergence and scaling guarantees. They concern four key questions that traditionally receive little attention in \{ML\} research: How can an \{ML\} program be distributed over a cluster? How can \{ML\} computation be bridged with inter-machine communication? How can such communication be performed? What should be communicated between machines? By exposing underlying statistical and algorithmic characteristics unique to \{ML\} programs but not typically seen in traditional computer programs, and by dissecting successful cases to reveal how we have harnessed these principles to design and develop both high-performance distributed \{ML\} software as well as general-purpose \{ML\} frameworks, we present opportunities for \{ML\} researchers and practitioners to further shape and enlarge the area that lies between \{ML\} and systems.

However, its applicability to complex problems remains problematic due to different causes. Particularly important among these are the high quantity of data required by the agent to learn useful policies and the poor scalability to high-dimensional problems due to the use of local approximators. This paper presents a novel \{RL\} algorithm, called online fitted policy iteration (OFPI), that steps forward in both directions. \{OFPI\} is based on a semi-batch scheme that increases the convergence speed by reusing data and enables the use of global approximators by reformulating the value function approximation as a standard supervised problem. The proposed method has been empirically evaluated in three benchmark problems. During the experiments, \{OFPI\} has employed a neural network trained with the extreme learning machine algorithm to approximate the value functions. Results have demonstrated the stability of \{OFPI\} using a global function approximator and also performance improvements over two baseline algorithms (SARSA and Q-learning) combined with eligibility traces and a radial basis function network.

Here some techniques are presented for the pre-processing of free-text breast cancer pathology reports, with the aim of facilitating the extraction of information relevant to cancer staging. Materials and methods The first technique was implemented using the freely available software RapidMiner to classify the reports according to their general layout: ‘semi-structured’ and ‘unstructured’. The second technique was developed using the open source language engineering framework \{GATE\} and aimed at the prediction of chunks of the report text containing information pertaining to the cancer morphology, the tumour size, its hormone receptor status and the number of positive nodes. The classifiers were trained and tested respectively on sets of 635 and 163 manually classified or annotated reports, from the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry. Results The best result of 99.4% accuracy – which included only one semi-structured report predicted as unstructured – was produced by the layout classifier with the k nearest algorithm, using the binary term occurrence word vector type with stopword filter and pruning. For chunk recognition, the best results were found using the \{PAUM\} algorithm with the same parameters for all cases, except for the prediction of chunks containing cancer morphology. For semi-structured reports the performance ranged from 0.97 to 0.94 and from 0.92 to 0.83 in precision and recall, while for unstructured reports performance ranged from 0.91 to 0.64 and from 0.68 to 0.41 in precision and recall. Poor results were found when the classifier was trained on semi-structured reports but tested on unstructured. Conclusions These results show that it is possible and beneficial to predict the layout of reports and that the accuracy of prediction of which segments of a report may contain certain information is sensitive to the report layout and the type of information sought.

Assuming that the stature of an individual is indirectly related to bone measurement values, we can derive methods that learn from archaeological data and construct models that give good estimates of the stature. Two novel machine learning-based regression models for stature estimation are proposed in this paper. Experiments using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms were performed on samples from the Terry Collection Postcranial Osteometric Database, and the obtained results are discussed and compared with the results from other similar studies. The experimental evaluations indicate that the machine learning-based regression models are efficient for the stature estimation of archaeological remains and highlight the potential of our proposal.

The proposed soft sensor model integrates an enhanced hidden layer based dynamic extreme learning machine (EHLDELM) with the partial least-square regression (PLSR). The traditional extreme learning machine with a static structure cannot well deal with the dynamic feature of the process data, so a dynamic strategy is adopted. Additionally, a special linear hidden layer node is added in the dynamic extreme learning machine to further enhance the performance. Then, the partial least-square method is utilized to deal with the collinearity problem. Finally, an optimal model between the hidden layer and the output layer is obtained. Thus, a novel robust nonlinear soft sensor model integrated \{EHLDELM\} with \{PLSR\} (PLSR-EHLDELM) is proposed. As a case study, the proposed PLSR-EHLDELM model is demonstrated through an application to the Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) for estimation of the key process variable.

Moreover, the kernel extension of triplet-based model is also nontrivial and computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel method to learn a combined distance and similarity measure (CDSM). By incorporating with the max-margin model, we suggest a triplet-based \{CDSM\} learning model with a unified regularizer of the Frobenius norm. A support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm is then adopted to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, we extend \{CDSM\} for learning nonlinear measures via the kernel trick. Two effective strategies are adopted to speed up training and testing of kernelized CDSM. Experiments on the UCI, handwritten digits and person re-identification datasets demonstrate that \{CDSM\} and kernelized \{CDSM\} outperform several state-of-the-art metric learning methods. "}

First, using the self-representation of data matrix, we formalize the feature selection problem as a matrix factorization with low-rank constraints. This matrix factorization formulation also embeds structure learning regularization as well as a sparse regularized term. Second, we present an effective technique to approximate low-rank constraints and propose a convergent algorithm in a batch mode. This technique can serve as an algorithmic framework for general low-rank recovery problems as well. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated in twelve publicly available datasets from machine learning repository. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable to achieve competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of clustering performance.

abstract = {"Abstract Balanced dataset has been utilized by the previous human activity recognition algorithms to train the classifier. However, imbalanced dataset are ubiquitous in human activity recognition, especially in the case of abnormal activity detection. Though the class imbalance problem exists as a universal phenomenon in human activity recognition, few researches mentioned this problem and solved it. In order to reduce the influence of the imbalance datasets problem, the mixed-kernel based weighted extreme learning machine (MK-WELM) has been proposed in this paper. Considering that the performance of extreme learning machine (ELM) is greatly influenced by the choice of kernel, the mixed kernel method is proposed for ELM. In order to deal with the imbalanced problem, the cost sensitive method is utilized. The main idea of the cost sensitive method is that the cost of minority class increases with the misclassification rate. Considering the cost sensitive function and the mixed kernel method, the MK-WELM is constructed. Comparing with \{ELM\} and weighted \{ELM\} methods, experimental results over different human activity datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. "}

abstract = {"AbstractBackground and objective Percutaneous coronary interventional procedures need advance planning prior to stenting or an endarterectomy. Cardiologists use intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for screening, risk assessment and stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). We hypothesize that plaque components are vulnerable to rupture due to plaque progression. Currently, there are no standard grayscale \{IVUS\} tools for risk assessment of plaque rupture. This paper presents a novel strategy for risk stratification based on plaque morphology embedded with principal component analysis (PCA) for plaque feature dimensionality reduction and dominant feature selection technique. The risk assessment utilizes 56 grayscale coronary features in a machine learning framework while linking information from carotid and coronary plaque burdens due to their common genetic makeup. Method This system consists of a machine learning paradigm which uses a support vector machine (SVM) combined with \{PCA\} for optimal and dominant coronary artery morphological feature extraction. Carotid artery proven intima-media thickness (cIMT) biomarker is adapted as a gold standard during the training phase of the machine learning system. For the performance evaluation, K-fold cross validation protocol is adapted with 20 trials per fold. For choosing the dominant features out of the 56 grayscale features, a polling strategy of \{PCA\} is adapted where the original value of the features is unaltered. Different protocols are designed for establishing the stability and reliability criteria of the coronary risk assessment system (cRAS). Results Using the PCA-based machine learning paradigm and cross-validation protocol, a classification accuracy of 98.43% (AUC 0.98) with K = 10 folds using an \{SVM\} radial basis function (RBF) kernel was achieved. A reliability index of 97.32% and machine learning stability criteria of 5% were met for the cRAS. Conclusions This is the first Computer aided design (CADx) system of its kind that is able to demonstrate the ability of coronary risk assessment and stratification while demonstrating a successful design of the machine learning system based on our assumptions.

Firstly, a set of 39-D discriminative feature vectors, consisting of local features, morphological features, phase congruency, Hessian and divergence of vector fields, is extracted for each pixel of the fundus image. Then a matrix is constructed for pixel of the training set based on the feature vector and the manual labels, and acts as the input of the \{ELM\} classifier. The output of classifier is the binary retinal vascular segmentation. Finally, an optimization processing is implemented to remove the region less than 30 pixels which is isolated from the retinal vascilar. The experimental results testing on the public Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) database demonstrate that the proposed method is much faster than the other methods in segmenting the retinal vessels. Meanwhile the average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 0.9607, 0.7140 and 0.9868, respectively. Moreover the proposed method exhibits high speed and robustness on a new Retinal Images for Screening (RIS) database.

Fifty-five \{PNES\} video-EEG recordings were retrospectively analyzed by four epileptologists and one psychiatrist in a blind manner and classified into four distinct groups: Hypermotor (H), Akinetic (A), Focal Motor (FM), and with Subjective Symptoms (SS). Eleven signs and symptoms, which are frequently found in PNESs, were chosen for statistical validation of our classification. An artificial neural network (ANN) analyzed \{PNES\} video recordings based on the signs and symptoms mentioned above. By comparing results produced by the \{ANN\} with classifications given by examiners, we were able to understand whether such classification was objective and generalizable. Through accordance metrics based on signs and symptoms (range: 0–100%), we found that most of the seizures belonging to class A showed a high degree of accordance (mean ± \{SD\} = 73% ± 5%); a similar pattern was found for class \{SS\} (80% slightly lower accordance was reported for class H (58% ± 18%)), with a minimum of 30% in some cases. Low agreement arose from the \{FM\} group. Seizures were univocally assigned to a given class in 83.6% of seizures. The \{ANN\} classified \{PNESs\} in the same way as visual examination in 86.7%. Agreement between \{ANN\} classification and visual classification reached 83.3% (SD = 17.8%) accordance for class H, 100% (SD = 22%) for class A, 83.3% (SD = 21.2%) for class SS, and 50% (SD = 19.52%) for class FM. This is the first study in which the validity of a new \{PNES\} classification was established and reached in two different ways. Video-EEG evaluation needs to be performed by an experienced clinician, but later on, it may be fed into \{ANN\} analysis, whose feedback will provide guidance for differential diagnosis. Our analysis, supported by the \{ML\} approach, showed that this model of classification could be objectively performed by video-EEG examination. "}

Recent technologies such as microarray and next-generation sequencing have paved the way for computational methods and techniques to play critical roles in this regard. Many important problems in cell biology require the dense nonlinear interactions between functional modules to be considered. The importance of computer simulation in understanding cellular processes is now widely accepted, and a variety of simulation algorithms useful for studying certain subsystems have been designed. In this article, a sparse compact incremental learning machine (SCILM) is proposed for cancer classification problem on microarray gene expression data, which take advantage of correntropy cost that makes it robust against diverse noises and outliers. Moreover, since \{SCILM\} uses l1-norm of the weights, it has sparseness, which can be applied for gene selection purposes as well. Finally, due to compact structure, the proposed method is capable of performing classification tasks in all of the cases with only one neuron in its hidden layer. The experimental analysis is performed on 26 well-known microarray data sets regarding diverse kinds of cancers and the results show that the proposed method not only achieved significantly high accuracy but also because of its sparseness, final connectivity weights determined the value and effectivity of each gene regarding the corresponding cancer.

In the developed SaE-ELM model, the network hidden node parameters of the \{ELM\} are optimized using SaE algorithm. The precision of the SaE-ELM is then compared with the \{ELM\} model. Daily weather data sets including minimum, maximum and average air temperatures (Tmin, Tmax and Tavg), atmospheric pressure (P) and global solar radiation (RS) collected for two Iranian stations of Bandar Abbas and Kerman with different climate conditions have been utilized. After primary evaluation, Tmin, Tmax and Tavg are considered as final inputs for the \{ELM\} and SaE-ELM models due to their high correlations with \{ST\} at all depths. The achieved results for both stations reveal that both \{ELM\} and SaE-ELM models offer desirable performance to estimate daily \{ST\} at all depths; nevertheless, a slightly more precision can be obtained by the SaE-ELM model. The performance of the \{ELM\} and SaE-ELM models are verified against genetic programming (GP) and artificial neural network (ANN) models developed in this study. For Bandar Abbass station, the obtained mean absolute bias error (MABE) and correlation coefficient (R) for the \{ELM\} model at different depths are in the range of 0.9116–1.5988 °C and 0.9023–0.9840, respectively while for the SaE-ELM model they are in the range of 0.8660–1.5338 °C and 0.9084–0.9893, respectively.

They provide automatic feature extraction and both richer representation capabilities and better performance than traditional feature based techniques (i.e., surface methods). Traditional surface approaches are based on complex manually extracted features, and this extraction process is a fundamental question in feature driven methods. These long-established approaches can yield strong baselines, and their predictive capabilities can be used in conjunction with the arising deep learning methods. In this paper we seek to improve the performance of deep learning techniques integrating them with traditional surface approaches based on manually extracted features. The contributions of this paper are sixfold. First, we develop a deep learning based sentiment classifier using a word embeddings model and a linear machine learning algorithm. This classifier serves as a baseline to compare to subsequent results. Second, we propose two ensemble techniques which aggregate our baseline classifier with other surface classifiers widely used in Sentiment Analysis. Third, we also propose two models for combining both surface and deep features to merge information from several sources. Fourth, we introduce a taxonomy for classifying the different models found in the literature, as well as the ones we propose. Fifth, we conduct several experiments to compare the performance of these models with the deep learning baseline. For this, we use seven public datasets that were extracted from the microblogging and movie reviews domain. Finally, as a result, a statistical study confirms that the performance of these proposed models surpasses that of our original baseline on F1-Score. "}

In a precisely matched group of individuals with \{MDD\} (n =25) and healthy controls (n =25), \{SVM\} learning accurately (74%) classified patients and controls across a brain map of white matter fractional anisotropy values (FA). The study revealed three main findings: 1) \{SVM\} applied to \{DTI\} derived \{FA\} maps can accurately classify \{MDD\} vs. healthy controls; 2) prediction is strongest when only right hemisphere white matter is examined; and 3) removing \{FA\} values from a region identified by univariate contrast as significantly different between \{MDD\} and healthy controls does not change the \{SVM\} accuracy. These results indicate that \{SVM\} learning applied to neuroimaging data can classify the presence versus absence of \{MDD\} and that predictive information is distributed across brain networks rather than being highly localized. Finally, \{MDD\} group differences revealed through typical univariate contrasts do not necessarily reveal patterns that provide accurate predictive information. "}

Nowadays, there is a growing consensus that the increasing dimensionality poses impeding effects on the performances of classifiers, which is termed as the “peaking phenomenon” in the field of machine intelligence. To address the issue, dimensionality reduction is commonly employed as a preprocessing step on the Big dimensional data before building the classifiers. In this paper, we propose an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) approach for large-scale data analytic. In contrast to existing approaches, we embed hidden nodes that are designed using singular value decomposition (SVD) into the classical ELM. These \{SVD\} nodes in the hidden layer are shown to capture the underlying characteristics of the Big dimensional data well, exhibiting excellent generalization performances. The drawback of using \{SVD\} on the entire dataset, however, is the high computational complexity involved. To address this, a fast divide and conquer approximation scheme is introduced to maintain computational tractability on high volume data. The resultant algorithm proposed is labeled here as Fast Singular Value Decomposition-Hidden-nodes based Extreme Learning Machine or FSVD-H-ELM in short. In FSVD-H-ELM, instead of identifying the \{SVD\} hidden nodes directly from the entire dataset, \{SVD\} hidden nodes are derived from multiple random subsets of data sampled from the original dataset. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons are conducted to assess the FSVD-H-ELM against other state-of-the-art algorithms. The results obtained demonstrated the superior generalization performance and efficiency of the FSVD-H-ELM. "}

Alternatively, taphonomic studies on bone surface modifications and bone breakage patterns, have provided heuristic interpretations of some of the best preserved archaeological record of this period; namely, the Olduvai Bed I sites. The most recent and comprehensive taphonomic study of these sites (Domínguez-Rodrigo et al., 2007a) showed that \{FLK\} Zinj was an anthropogenic assemblage in which hominins acquired carcasses via primary access. That study also showed that the other sites were palimpsests with minimal or no intervention by hominins. The \{FLK\} N, \{FLK\} \{NN\} and \{DK\} sequence seemed to be dominated by single-agent (mostly, felid) or multiple-agent (mostly, felid-hyenid) processes. The present study re-analyzes the Bed I sites focusing on skeletal part profiles. Machine learning methods, which incorporate complex algorithms, are powerful predictive and classification methods and have the potential to better extract information from skeletal part representation than past approaches. Here, multiple algorithms (via decision trees, neural networks, random forests and support vector machines) are combined to produce a solid interpretation of bone accumulation agency at the Olduvai Bed I sites. This new approach virtually coincides with previous taphonomic interpretations on a site by site basis and shows that felids were dominant accumulating agents over hyenas during Bed I times. The recent discovery of possibly a modern lion-accumulated assemblage at Olduvai Gorge (Arriaza et al., submitted) provides a very timely analog for this interpretation. "}

For many mixing and agitation processes, such as in dough making, as mixing energy is placed, the resistance to extension increases and then after some point it decreases again. High-quality bread is obtained by stopping mixing at or close to the maximum resistance. The change in resistance causes a change in motor torque. The torque change affects the motor’s current draw for agitation and mixing machines driven by electrical motors. The rheological characteristics of the mixed material are related to motor torque of the mixing machine. Therefore, it is related to the motor electric current where the load variation can be estimated by a low-cost current sensor. This paper outlines a novel design for an intelligent agitator/mixer process controller. The design is based on current sensing and on-line learning through reinforcement learning using operator input. The system provides a low-cost approach to automate various kinds of production equipment currently operated manually, which are common in the developing world. Additionally, the approach requires minimal modification to the equipment: it requires only a current sensor, an on/off control relay, a set of buttons for operation, and an embedded system. "}

Unfortunately, the detailed kinetic schemes required to optimize industrial biomass pyrolysis processes are too computationally expensive to include in models that account for both kinetics and transport within reacting particles. Here we present a machine learning approach using artificial neural networks and decision trees to reduce the computational expense of detailed kinetic models by four orders of magnitude, enabling their use in comprehensive models. The trained neural networks generalize very well, predicting the outputs of the detailed kinetic model with over 99.9% accuracy on new data. The machine learning approach we outline is not specific to kinetic modeling and can be applied to any set of input and output data, even if the underlying relationship between inputs and outputs is unknown.

In many practical systems, data in the past is still useful but no longer available. Therefore, a question arises on how to update the model based on both new data and current model. To address this issue, our framework lays its basis on ensemble method with multiple sub-classifiers, independent of base type. When new data is processed, new sub-classifiers are generated accordingly. The classifiers are then dynamically combined using decision tree, together with a novelly proposed pruning method to prevent overfitting and eliminate out-dated models. Guarantees are provided to the combination method. Experiments indicate that the framework achieves good performance when the data changes with time, and has better accuracy compared to existing transfer and incremental learning, and methods in stream data mining.

Higher level of thermal comfort attracts more visitors to such places; hence, brings benefits to the community. Previous research works have used the body energy balance or adaptation model for predicting the thermal comfort in outdoor spaces. However, limited research works have applied computational methods in this field. For the first of its’ type, this study applied a systematic approach using a class of soft-computing methodology known as the extreme learning machine (ELM) to forecast the thermal comfort of the subject visitors at an open area in Iran. For data collection, this study used common thermal indices for assessing the thermal perceptions of the subjects. The fieldworks comprised of measuring the microclimatic conditions and interviewing the visitors. This study compared the results of \{ELM\} with other conventional soft-computing methods (i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic programming (GP)). The findings indicate that the \{ELM\} results match with the field data. This implies that a model constructed by \{ELM\} can accurately predict visitors’ thermal sensations. We conclude that the proposed model’s predictability performance is reliable and superior compared to other approaches (i.e., \{GP\} and ANN). Besides, the \{ELM\} methodology significantly reduces training time for a Neural Network as compared to the conventional methods. "}

Participants included 39 amphetamine mono-dependent, 44 heroin mono-dependent, 58 polysubstance dependent, and 81 non-substance dependent individuals. The majority of substance dependent participants were in protracted abstinence. We used demographic, personality (trait impulsivity, trait psychopathy, aggression, sensation seeking), psychiatric (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, psychopathy, anxiety, depression), and neurocognitive impulsivity measures (Delay Discounting, Go/No-Go, Stop Signal, Immediate Memory, Balloon Analogue Risk, Cambridge Gambling, and Iowa Gambling tasks) as predictors in a machine-learning algorithm. Results The machine-learning approach revealed substance-specific multivariate profiles that classified \{HD\} and \{AD\} in new samples with high degree of accuracy. Out of 54 predictors, psychopathy was the only classifier common to both types of addiction. Important dissociations emerged between factors classifying \{HD\} and AD, which often showed opposite patterns among individuals with \{HD\} and AD. Conclusions These results suggest that different mechanisms may underlie \{HD\} and AD, challenging the unitary account of drug addiction. This line of work may shed light on the development of standardized and cost-efficient clinical diagnostic tests and facilitate the development of individualized prevention and intervention programs for \{HD\} and AD.

In this paper, we combine hyperspectral imaging, operating in the wavelength range 380–1028 nm, with several machine learning algorithms to deal automatically with the classification of lamb muscles. More specifically, we study the discrimination of four different lamb muscles, namely, Longissimus dorsi, Psoas major, Semimembranosus and Semitendinosus from thirty lambs of Churra Galega Mirandesa breed. The objective of the paper is to determine the best method for muscle classification. In the experimental study we report an analysis of the performance of seven classifiers. We study their behavior when they are applied over the original data as well as over the data pre-processed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. The seven classifiers used to differentiate the muscle types are two Artificial Neural Networks, namely the linear Least Mean Squares (LMS) classifier and the Multilayer Perceptron with Scaled Conjugate Gradient (MLP-SCG), two Support Vector Machines (SVM), namely the ν \{SVM\} and the \{SVM\} trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), the Logistic Regression (LR), the Center Based Nearest Neighbor classifier and the Linear Discriminant Analysis. The best result, determined using a leave-one-animal-out scheme, is provided by the linear \{LMS\} classifier using the original data, since it correctly classifies 96.67% of the samples. The LR, the MLP-SCG using original data and the \{SVM\} trained with \{SMO\} on data preprocessed with \{PCA\} are also suitable techniques to tackle the lamb muscle classification problem. "}

The proposed approach uses ten different evaluation criteria to decide the relevance of a particular feature. The existing feature selection techniques are also reviewed. A new database of 178 breast ultrasound images consisting of 88 benign and 90 malignant cases are used in experiments. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with that of existing feature selection techniques using back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) and support vector machine (SVM) based classifiers.

Experimental results on a wide variety of real world small instance size and large instance size applications in the context of binary classification, multi-class problem and regression are then reported to show that \{RKELM\} can perform at competitive level of generalized performance as the SVM/LS-SVM at only a fraction of the computational effort incurred.

As next step, we construct heterogeneous ensembles that make use of multiple base algorithms and benefit from a gain of diversity among the weak predictors. In the experimental evaluation, we show that a combination of decision trees and support vector regression outperforms state-of-the-art predictors (improvements of up to 37% compared to support vector regression) as well as homogeneous ensembles while requiring a shorter runtime (speed-ups from 1.60× to 8.78×). Furthermore, we show the heterogeneous ensemble prediction can be improved when using high-dimensional patterns by increasing the number of past steps considered and hereby the spatio-temporal information available by the measurements of the nearby turbines.

The discussion focuses on views of cognition as a dynamic property in which the world is actively represented in grounded mental states which only have meaning in the action context. Reasoning is understood as an emerging property consequence of actions-environment couplings achieved through experience, and concepts as situated and dynamic phenomena enabling behaviours. Re-framing the characteristics of concepts is considered crucial to overcoming settled beliefs and reinterpreting new understandings in artificial systems. The first part presents a review of concepts from cognitive sciences. Support is found for views on grounded and embodied cognition, describing concepts as dynamic, flexible, context-dependent, and distributedly coded. That is argued to contrast with many technical implementations assuming concepts as categories, whilst explains limitations when grounding amodal symbols, or in unifying learning, perception and reasoning. The characteristics of concepts are linked to methods of active inference, self-organization, and deep learning to address challenges posed and to reinterpret emerging techniques. In a second part, an architecture based on deep generative models is presented to illustrate arguments elaborated. It is evaluated in a navigation task, showing that sufficient representations are created regarding situated behaviours with no semantics imposed on data. Moreover, adequate behaviours are achieved through a dynamic integration of perception and action in a single representational domain and process. "}

These techniques would potentially offer new avenues to understand and prevent energy losses during transmission.

The proposed algorithm consists of two components, namely the cognitive component and the meta-cognitive component. The cognitive component is an online sequential extreme learning machine while the meta-cognitive component controls the learning process of the cognitive component using a self-regulating mechanism to decide what to learn, when to learn and how to learn the arriving samples. Active learning is employed to select different strategies, namely sample deletion, sample reserve and sample learning strategy to determine whether the data will be deleted directly, reserved for later use or used immediately. This is the first time the similarity of meta-cognitive machine learning and active learning is exploited. The meta-cognition mechanism and active learning principle are utilized to reduce the labeling efforts and costs. The use of \{ELM\} greatly reduces the computation complexity of the learning process. The new algorithm is evaluated on a set of real-world benchmark classification problems. Simulation results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of sequential active learning and show that the SEAL-ELM can achieve similar or better learning accuracy with a much faster learning speed compared with the state-of-the-arts algorithms.

abstract = {"Abstract Identifying diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) presenting with normal appearing radiological \{MRI\} presents a significant challenge. Neuroimaging methods such as diffusion \{MRI\} and probabilistic tractography, which probe the connectivity of neural networks, show significant promise. We present a machine learning approach to classify \{TBI\} participants primarily with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on altered structural connectivity patterns derived through the network based statistical analysis of structural connectomes generated from \{TBI\} and age-matched control groups. In this approach, higher order diffusion models were used to map white matter connections between 116 cortical and subcortical regions. Tracts between these regions were generated using probabilistic tracking and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) measures along these connections were encoded in the connectivity matrices. Network-based statistical analysis of the connectivity matrices was performed to identify the network differences between a representative subset of the two groups. The affected network connections provided the feature vectors for principal component analysis and subsequent classification by random forest. The validity of the approach was tested using data acquired from a total of 179 \{TBI\} patients and 146 controls participants. The analysis revealed altered connectivity within a number of intra- and inter-hemispheric white matter pathways associated with DAI, in consensus with existing literature. A mean classification accuracy of 68.16% ± 1.81% and mean sensitivity of 80.0% ± 2.36% were achieved in correctly classifying the \{TBI\} patients evaluated on the subset of the participants that was not used for the statistical analysis, in a 10-fold cross-validation framework. These results highlight the potential for statistical machine learning approaches applied to structural connectomes to identify patients with diffusive axonal injury. "}

This research proposes a hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) for slope stability assessment based on metaheuristic and machine learning. The contribution of this study to the body of knowledge is multifold. First, advantages of the Firefly Algorithm (FA) and the Least Squares Support Vector Classification (LS-SVC) are combined to establish an integrated slope prediction model. Second, an inner cross-validation with the operating characteristic curve computation is embedded in the training process to reliably construct the machine learning model. Third, the FA, an effective and easily implemented metaheuristic, is employed to optimize the model construction process by appropriately selecting the LS-SVM's hyper-parameters. Finally, a dataset that contains 168 real cases of slope evaluation, recorded in various countries, is used to establish and confirm the proposed hybrid approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the new hybrid \{AI\} model has achieved roughly 4% improvement in classification accuracy compared with other benchmark methods. "}

However, what is not known is how to integrate clinical variables into a clinically useful tool in order to estimate the probability of an individual patient attempting suicide. Method A total of 144 patients with mood disorders were included. Clinical variables associated with suicide attempts among patients with mood disorders and demographic variables were used to ‘train’ a machine learning algorithm. The resulting algorithm was utilized in identifying novel or ‘unseen’ individual subjects as either suicide attempters or non-attempters. Three machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated. Results All algorithms distinguished individual suicide attempters from non-attempters with prediction accuracy ranging between 65% and 72% (p&lt;0.05). In particular, the relevance vector machine (RVM) algorithm correctly predicted 103 out of 144 subjects translating into 72% accuracy (72.1% sensitivity and 71.3% specificity) and an area under the curve of 0.77 (p&lt;0.0001). The most relevant predictor variables in distinguishing attempters from non-attempters included previous hospitalizations for depression, a history of psychosis, cocaine dependence and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) comorbidity. Conclusion Risk for suicide attempt among patients with mood disorders can be estimated at an individual subject level by incorporating both demographic and clinical variables. Future studies should examine the performance of this model in other populations and its subsequent utility in facilitating selection of interventions to prevent suicide. "}

We use a Lyapunov approach to prove both asymptotic stability of estimation error and boundedness in the model parameters suitable for identification of nonlinear dynamic systems. Using the Lyapunov approach, we determine an upper bound for the learning rate of SG-ELM. The SG-ELM algorithm not only guarantees a stable learning but also reduces the computational demand compared to the recursive least squares based OS-ELM algorithm (Liang et al., 2006). In order to demonstrate the working of SG-ELM on a real-world problem, an advanced combustion engine identification is considered. The algorithm is applied to two case studies: An online regression learning for system identification of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Engine and an online classification learning (with class imbalance) for identifying the dynamic operating envelope. The case studies demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed SG-ELM is comparable to that of the OS-ELM approach but adds stability and a reduction in computational effort. "}

Despite the growing number of machine-learning algorithms that have been developed, relatively few studies have provided a comparison of an array of different learners — typically, model comparison studies have been restricted to a comparison of only a few models. This study evaluates and compares a suite of 10 machine-learners as classification algorithms for the prediction of soil taxonomic units in the Lower Fraser Valley, British Columbia, Canada. A variety of machine-learners (CART, \{CART\} with bagging, Random Forest, k-nearest neighbor, nearest shrunken centroid, artificial neural network, multinomial logistic regression, logistic model trees, and support vector machine) were tested in the extraction of the complex relationships between soil taxonomic units (great groups and orders) from a conventional soil survey and a suite of 20 environmental covariates representing the topography, climate, and vegetation of the study area. Methods used to extract training data from a soil survey included by-polygon, equal-class, area-weighted, and area-weighted with random over sampling (ROS) approaches. The fitted models, which consist of the soil-environmental relationships, were then used to predict soil great groups and orders for the entire study area at a 100 m spatial resolution. The resulting maps were validated using 262 points from legacy soil data. On average, the area-weighted sampling approach for developing training data from a soil survey was most effective. Using a validation of R = 1 cell, the k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine with radial basis function resulted in the highest accuracy of 72% for great groups using ROS; however, models such as \{CART\} with bagging, logistic model trees, and Random Forest were preferred due to the speed of parameterization and the interpretability of the results while resulting in similar accuracies ranging from 65–70% using the area-weighted sampling approach. Model choice and sample design greatly influenced outputs. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of machine-learning techniques for classification purposes in soil science and may assist in model selection for digital soil mapping and geomorphic modeling studies in the future.

The lessons learnt from this extensive evaluation are further confirmed by running experiments on a broad range of real-world datasets. Through this thorough evaluation we obtain a solid understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the evaluated \{GPU\} strategies for boosting the efficiency of evolutionary machine learning systems.

Hierarchical clustering was used to group the crop yield data from 40 Census Agricultural Regions (CARs) into several larger regions for building the forecast models. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and \{NDVI\} derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were considered as predictors for crop yields. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and two nonlinear machine learning models – Bayesian neural networks (BNN) and model-based recursive partitioning (MOB) – were used to forecast crop yields, with various combinations of MODIS-NDVI, MODIS-EVI and NOAA-NDVI as predictors. Crop yield forecasts made using predictors from July and earlier were evaluated by the cross-validated mean absolute error skill score (in reference to climatological forecasts) during 2000–2011. While MODIS-NDVI was found to be the most effective predictor for all three crops, having MODIS-EVI as an additional predictor enhanced the forecast skills. While MLR, \{BNN\} and \{MOB\} all showed significantly higher skills than climatological forecasts for all three crops, barley was the only case where the nonlinear \{BNN\} and \{MOB\} models showed slightly higher skills than MLR. The lack of skill improvement by nonlinear models over \{MLR\} is likely due to the short (12 years) record available for \{MODIS\} data, which limits our study to 2000–2011, with very low yields coming from a single severe drought year (2002).

The least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) machine learning algorithm was implemented to identify neurocognitive signatures to distinguish individual \{BD\} patients from HC. Results The \{LASSO\} machine learning algorithm identified individual \{BD\} patients from \{HC\} with an accuracy of 71%, area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.7143 and significant at p=0.0053. The \{LASSO\} algorithm assigned individual subjects with a probability score (0–healthy, 1–patient).

abstract = {"Abstract The extreme learning machine (ELM) is a new method for using Single-hidden Layer Feed-forward Networks (SLFNs) with a much simpler training method. While conventional extreme learning machine are based on the training and test data which should be under the same distribution, in reality it is often desirable to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data. Transfer learning (TL) aims to solve related but different target domain problems by using plenty of labeled source domain data. When the task from one new domain comes, new domain samples are relabeled costly, and it would be a waste to discard all the old domain data. Therefore, an algorithm called TL-ELM based on the \{ELM\} algorithm is proposed, which uses a small amount of target domain tag data and a large number of source domain old data to build a high-quality classification model. The method inherits the advantages of \{ELM\} and makes up for the defects that traditional \{ELM\} cannot transfer knowledge. Experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed methods is superior to or at least comparable with existing benchmarking methods. In addition, a novel domain adaptation kernel extreme learning machine (TL-DAKELM) based on the kernel extreme learning machine was proposed with respect to the TL-ELM. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. "}

There are many approaches to retargeting, although no “best” method has been agreed upon. Therefore, finding ways to assess the quality of image retargeting has become a prominent challenge. Traditional image quality assessment methods are not directly applicable to image retargeting because the retargeted image size is not same as the original one. In this paper, we propose an open framework for image retargeting quality assessment, where the quality prediction engine is a trained Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network. Broadly, our approach is motivated by the observation that no single method can be expected to perform well on all types of content. We train the network on ten perceptually relevant features, including a saliency-weighted, SIFT-directed complex wavelet structural similarity (CW-SSIM) index, and a new image aesthetics evaluation method. These two features and eight other features are used by the neural network to learn to assess the quality of retargeted images. The accuracy of the new model is extensively verified by simulations.

This paper presents a new model based upon extreme learning machine (ELM) for sensor-less estimation of wind speed based on wind turbine parameters. The inputs for estimating the wind speed are wind turbine power coefficient, blade pitch angle, and rotational speed. In order to validate authors compared prediction of \{ELM\} model with the predictions with genetic programming (GP), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine with radial basis kernel function (SVM-RBF).

Finally, this study compared predicted wind speeds from each method against actual measurement data. Simulation results, clearly demonstrate that \{ELM\} can be utilized effectively in applications of sensor-less wind speed predictions.

Moreover, recent developments in parallel computing with \{ML\} present new possibilities for training and prediction speed and therefore make their usage in real-time systems feasible. This study compares four \{ML\} algorithms — random forests (RF), neural networks (NNET), averaged neural networks (AVNNET) and support vector machines (SVM) — for rainfall area detection and rainfall rate assignment using \{MSG\} \{SEVIRI\} data over Germany. Satellite-based proxies for cloud top height, cloud top temperature, cloud phase and cloud water path serve as predictor variables. The results indicate an overestimation of rainfall area delineation regardless of the \{ML\} algorithm (averaged bias = 1.8) but a high probability of detection ranging from 81% (SVM) to 85% (NNET). On a 24-hour basis, the performance of the rainfall rate assignment yielded \{R2\} values between 0.39 (SVM) and 0.44 (AVNNET). Though the differences in the algorithms' performance were rather small, \{NNET\} and \{AVNNET\} were identified as the most suitable algorithms. On average, they demonstrated the best performance in rainfall area delineation as well as in rainfall rate assignment. NNET's computational speed is an additional advantage in work with large datasets such as in remote sensing based rainfall retrievals. However, since no single algorithm performed considerably better than the others we conclude that further research in providing suitable predictors for rainfall is of greater necessity than an optimization through the choice of the \{ML\} algorithm.

The resultant feature is finally mapped into an associated quality score using ELM. As subjective evaluation scores by human beings are integrated into training, machine learning techniques can predict image quality more accurately than those traditional methods. Compared with other learning techniques such as support vector machine (SVM), \{ELM\} has better learning performance and faster learning speed. Experimental results on public databases show that the proposed \{BIBE\} correlates well with human perceived blurriness, and outperforms the state-of-the-art specific \{NR\} blur evaluation metrics as well as generic \{NR\} \{IQA\} methods. Moreover, the application of automatic focusing system for digital cameras further confirms the capability of BIBE. "}

Consequently, anticipate its presence is a matter of importance to prevent future risks. The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of central segregation severity in continuous cast steel slabs. This study presents a novel hybrid algorithm, based on support vector machines (SVMs) in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, for predicting the centerline segregation from operation input parameters determined experimentally in continuous cast steel slabs. This optimization technique involves kernel parameter setting in the \{SVM\} training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. Additionally, a multilayer perceptron network (MLP) and a multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) approach, this last method also in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, were fitted to the experimental data with comparison purposes. To this end, the most important physical–chemical parameters of this industrial process are monitored and analyzed. The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each physical–chemical variables on the segregation is presented through the model. Secondly, some models for predicting segregation are obtained with success. Indeed, regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and coefficients of determination equal to 0.98 for continuity factor estimation and 0.97 for average width were obtained when this hybrid PSO–SVM-based model with \{RBF\} kernel function was applied to the experimental dataset, respectively. Furthermore, the results obtained with the \{MLP\} and PSO–MARS-based models are clearly worse than those obtained with the PSO–RBF–SVM-based model. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter. Finally, conclusions of this innovative research work are exposed. "}

Various 3D shape descriptors have been developed over the last two decades; however, existing descriptors are handcrafted features that are labor-intensively designed and cannot extract discriminative information for a large set of data. In this paper, we propose a rapid 3D feature learning method, namely, a convolutional auto-encoder extreme learning machine (CAE-ELM) that combines the advantages of the convolutional neuron network, auto-encoder, and extreme learning machine (ELM). This method performs better and faster than other methods. In addition, we define a novel architecture based on CAE-ELM. The architecture accepts two types of 3D shape representation, namely, voxel data and signed distance field data (SDF), as inputs to extract the global and local features of 3D shapes. Voxel data describe structural information, whereas \{SDF\} data contain details on 3D shapes. Moreover, the proposed CAE-ELM can be used in practical graphics applications, such as 3D shape completion. Experiments show that the features extracted by CAE-ELM are superior to existing hand-crafted features and other deep learning methods or \{ELM\} models. Moreover, the classification accuracy of the proposed architecture is superior to that of other methods on ModelNet10 (91.4%) and ModelNet40 (84.35%).

abstract = {"Abstract The current energy requirements of buildings comprise a large percentage of the total energy consumed around the world. The demand of energy, as well as the construction materials used in buildings, are becoming increasingly problematic for the earth's sustainable future, and thus have led to alarming concern. The energy efficiency of buildings can be improved, and in order to do so, their operational energy usage should be estimated early in the design phase, so that buildings are as sustainable as possible. An early energy estimate can greatly help architects and engineers create sustainable structures. This study proposes a novel method to estimate building energy consumption based on the \{ELM\} (Extreme Learning Machine) method. This method is applied to building material thicknesses and their thermal insulation capability (K-value). For this purpose up to 180 simulations are carried out for different material thicknesses and insulation properties, using the EnergyPlus software application. The estimation and prediction obtained by the \{ELM\} model are compared with \{GP\} (genetic programming) and \{ANNs\} (artificial neural network) models for accuracy. The simulation results indicate that an improvement in predictive accuracy is achievable with the \{ELM\} approach in comparison with \{GP\} and ANN. "}

Multi-layer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM) stacks extreme learning machine based auto encoder (ELM-AE) to create a multi-layer neural network. ML-ELM not only approximates the complicated function but also achieves fast training time. The outputs of ELM-AE are the same as inputs, which cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the learning feature representations. We put forward extreme learning machine based denoising auto encoder (ELM-DAE) which introduces local denoising criterion into ELM-AE and is used as the basic component for Denoising ML-ELM. Resembling ML-ELM, Denoising ML-ELM stacks ELM-DAE to create a deep network. And then we introduce manifold regularization into the model of Denoising ML-ELM and propose denoising Laplacian ML-ELM (Denoising Lap-ML-ELM). Denoising Lap-ML-ELM is more efficient than SS-ELM in classification and does not need to spend too much time. Experimental results show that Denoising ML-ELM and Denoising Lap-ML-ELM are effective learning algorithms. "}

The analysis of spectral data derived using gamma-ray spectrometry can offer a powerful tool to rapidly estimate and map the activity, depth, and lateral distribution of 226Ra contamination covering an extensive area. Subsequently, reliable risk assessments can be developed for individual sites in a fraction of the timeframe compared to traditional labour-intensive sampling techniques: for example soil coring. However, local heterogeneity of the natural background, statistical counting uncertainty, and non-linear source response are confounding problems associated with gamma-ray spectral analysis. This is particularly challenging, when attempting to deal with enhanced concentrations of a naturally occurring radionuclide such as 226Ra. As a result, conventional surveys tend to attribute the highest activities to the largest total signal received by a detector (Gross counts): an assumption that tends to neglect higher activities at depth. To overcome these limitations, a methodology was developed making use of Monte Carlo simulations, Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning based algorithms to derive depth and activity estimates for 226Ra contamination. The approach was applied on spectra taken using two gamma-ray detectors (Lanthanum Bromide and Sodium Iodide), with the aim of identifying an optimised combination of detector and spectral processing routine. It was confirmed that, through a combination of Neural Networks and Lanthanum Bromide, the most accurate depth and activity estimates could be found. The advantage of the method was demonstrated by mapping depth and activity estimates at a case study site in Scotland. There the method identified significantly higher activity (&lt; 3 Bq g− 1) occurring at depth (&gt; 0.4 m), that conventional gross counting algorithms failed to identify. It was concluded that the method could easily be employed to identify areas of high activity potentially occurring at depth, prior to intrusive investigation using conventional sampling techniques.

The distributed \{ELM\} with MapReduce could handle large-scale training dataset efficiently, but how to cope with its updated hidden nodes number which aims to get the higher accuracy is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Distributed Extreme Learning Machine with MapReduce (A-ELM⁎). It could overcome the weakness of ELM⁎ in learning massive training dataset for updating hidden nodes number. Firstly, we found that through partial adjustment of incremental hidden nodes and decremental hidden nodes, matrix multiplication (the most computation-expensive part in A-ELM⁎) can be calculated. Next, A-ELM⁎ based on MapReduce framework is proposed. A-ELM⁎ first calculates the intermediate matrix multiplications of the updated hidden nodes subset, and then update the matrix multiplications by modifying the old matrix multiplications with the intermediate ones. Then, based on the updated matrix multiplications, there could obtain the corresponding new output weight vector with centralized computing. Therefore, it is effective for learning large scale training dataset, in which the hidden nodes update rapidly. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed A-ELM⁎, using synthetic data with extensive experiments, in learning updated hidden nodes. "}

Motivated by the ensemble ideas, the proposed RB-PLSIELM model is based on the bagging ensemble scheme to combine some individual nonlinear models integrating improved extreme learning machine with partial least square (PLSIELM). The sub-data for building the individual \{PLSIELM\} model are re-sampled from the original training data using the bagging tool. The problem of over-training in the \{PLSELM\} model can be avoided by using the bagging re-sampling technology. The proposed RB-PLSIELM model was demonstrated by applying it to predicting the key variables of the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) and the Purified Terephthalic Acid Process (PTAP). The simulation results obtained by RB-PLSIELM are compared with those obtained by the individual \{PLSELM\} model, the \{ELM\} model, and the partial least square regression (PLSR) model.

Therefore, it is of great significance to put \{ELM\} into learning tasks with only unlabeled data. One popular approach for mining knowledge from unlabeled data is based on the manifold assumption, which exploits the geometrical structure of data by assuming that nearby points will also be close to each other in transformation space. However, considering the manifold information only is insufficient for discriminative tasks. In this paper, we propose an improved unsupervised discriminative \{ELM\} (UDELM) model, whose main advantage is to combine the local manifold learning with global discriminative learning together. \{UDELM\} can be efficiently optimized by solving a generalized eigen-value decomposition problem. Extensive comparisons over several state-of-the-art models on clustering image and emotional \{EEG\} data demonstrate the efficacy of UDELM. "}

Nevertheless, variations in gait pattern can be utilised to this purpose, when measured via Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). Human gait, however, possesses a high degree of variability across individuals, and is subject to numerous nuisance factors. Therefore, off-the-shelf Machine Learning techniques may fail to classify it with the accuracy required in clinical trials. In this paper we propose a novel framework in which \{IMU\} gait measurement sequences sampled during a 10 m walk are first encoded as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to extract their dynamics and provide a fixed-length representation. Given sufficient training samples, the distance between \{HMMs\} which optimises classification performance is learned and employed in a classical Nearest Neighbour classifier. Our tests demonstrate how this technique achieves accuracy of 85.51% over a 156 people with Parkinson's with a representative range of severity and 424 typically developed adults, which is the top performance achieved so far over a cohort of such size, based on single measurement outcomes. The method displays the potential for further improvement and a wider application to distinguish other conditions. "}

Second, a series of the trade-off solutions with respect to the above-mentioned objective functions are found by the multiobjective membrane algorithm. Finally, a trade-off solution with the best generalization performance of ELM, which is chosen from the Pareto front obtained by the multiobjective algorithm, will become the final parameters for initializing the \{ELM\} network.

The data sets included triplicate measurements from 3 analytical methods across different pH and temperature conditions (2066 data features). Established machine learning techniques were used to determine whether the data sets contain sufficient discriminative power in this application. The support vector machine classifier identified the 8 distinct samples with high accuracy. For these data sets, there exists a minimum threshold in terms of information quality and volume to grant enough discriminative power. Generally, data from multiple analytical techniques, multiple pH conditions, and at least 200 representative features were required to achieve the highest discriminative accuracy. In addition to classification accuracy tests, various methods such as sample space visualization, similarity analysis based on Euclidean distance, and feature ranking by mutual information scores are demonstrated to display their effectiveness as modeling tools for biosimilarity assessments.

In addition, this paper shows that machine learning can be used effectively for the problem of intangible assets evaluation.

However, traditional \{ELM\} involves a large number of hidden nodes for complex real world regression and classification problems which increasing the computation burden. In this paper, a decomposition based fast \{ELM\} (DFELM) algorithm is proposed to effectively reduce the computational burden for large number of hidden nodes condition. Compared with \{ELM\} algorithm, \{DFELM\} algorithm has faster training time with a large number of hidden nodes maintaining the same accuracy performance. Experiment on three regression problems, six classification problems and a complex blast furnace modeling problem are carried out to verify the performance of \{DFELM\} algorithm. Moreover, the decomposition method can be extended to other modified \{ELM\} algorithms to further reduce the training time. "}

All methods identify two dominant landslide predictors (unfailed cliff slope angle and fault proximity). This information could support a range of management approaches, from the development of ‘rules-of-thumb’ to detailed models that incorporate all predictor information. In our study all statistical approaches correctly predict a high proportion (&gt;85%) of cases. Similar ‘success’ has been shown in other studies, but important questions should be asked about possible error sources, particularly in regard to absence data. In coastal landslide studies sign decay is a vexing issue, because sites prone to landsliding may also be sites of rapid evidence removal. "}

Recently machine learning (ML) techniques like artificial neural network (ANN) are being widely used for modeling the process of evapotranspiration. However, \{ANN\} faces issues like trapping in local minima, slow learning and tuning of meta-parameters. In this study an improved extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm was used to estimate weekly reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo). The study was carried out for Jodhpur and Pali meteorological weather stations located in the Thar Desert, India. The study evaluated the performance of three different input combinations. The first input combination used locally available maximum and minimum air temperature data while the second and third combination used \{ETo\} values from another station (extrinsic inputs) along with the locally available temperature data as inputs. The performance of \{ELM\} models was compared with the empirical Hargreaves equation, \{ANN\} and least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) models. Root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) and threshold statistics (TS) were used for comparing the performance of the models. The performance of \{ELM\} model was found to be better than the Hargreaves and \{ANN\} model. The LS-SVM and \{ELM\} displayed similar performance. \{ELM3\} models, with 36 and 33 neurons in hidden layer were found to be the best models (RMSE of 0.43 for Jodhpur and 0.33 for Pali station) for estimating weekly \{ETo\} at Jodhpur and Pali stations respectively. The results showed that \{ELM\} is a simple yet efficient algorithm which exhibited good performance; hence, can be recommended for estimating weekly ETo. Furthermore, it was also found that use of \{ETo\} values from another station can help in improving the efficiency of \{ML\} models in limited data scenario. "}

The proposed variant of the ELM, henceforth named Robust \{ELM\} (RELM), is designed using M-estimators to compute the output weights instead of the standard ordinary least squares (OLS) method. We evaluate the performance of the \{RELM\} using batch and recursive learning rules, and also introduce a model selection strategy based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to find an optimal architecture for datasets contaminated with non-Gaussian noise and outliers. By means of comprehensive computer simulations using synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that the proposed Robust \{ELM\} classifiers consistently outperforms the original version. "}

To avoid manual labeling, semi-supervised learning uses unlabeled data along with the labeled data in the training process. Transductive support vector machine (TSVM) is one such semi-supervised, which has been found effective in enhancing the classification performance. However there are some deficiencies in TSVM, such as presetting number of the positive class samples, frequently exchange of class label, and its requirement for larger amount of unlabeled data. To tackle these deficiencies, in this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised learning algorithm based on active learning combined with TSVM. The algorithm applies active learning to select the most informative instances based on the version space minimum–maximum division principle with human annotation for improve the classification performance. Simultaneously, in order to make full use of the distribution characteristics of unlabeled data, we added a manifold regularization term to the objective function. Experiments performed on several \{UCI\} datasets and a real world book review case study demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant improvement over other benchmark methods yet consuming less amount of human effort, which is very important while labeling data manually.

However, transplantation is restricted by the lack of suitable donors, resulting in significant waiting list deaths. This paper proposes a novel donor-recipient allocation system that uses machine learning to predict graft survival after transplantation using a dataset comprised of donor-recipient pairs from the King’s College Hospital (United Kingdom). The main novelty of the system is that it tackles the imbalanced nature of the dataset by considering semi-supervised learning, analysing its potential for obtaining more robust and equitable models in liver transplantation. We propose two different sources of unsupervised data for this specific problem (recent transplants and virtual donor-recipient pairs) and two methods for using these data during model construction (a semi-supervised algorithm and a label propagation scheme). The virtual pairs and the label propagation method are shown to alleviate the imbalanced distribution. The results of our experiments show that the use of synthetic and real unsupervised information helps to improve and stabilise the performance of the model and leads to fairer decisions with respect to the use of only supervised data. Moreover, the best model is combined with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score (MELD), which is at the moment the most popular assignation methodology worldwide. By doing this, our decision-support system considers both the compatibility of the donor and the recipient (by our prediction system) and the recipient severity (via the \{MELD\} score), supporting then the principles of fairness and benefit.

One popular variant of \{ELM\} is the Online Sequential \{ELM\} (OS-ELM), which can deal with sequential learning tasks. However, limitations exist in the OS-ELM such as requiring the initialization phase, pre-defined important parameters, running into singularity problem, inconsistent and potentially unreliable performance. In this paper, an Online Sequential Regularized \{ELM\} (OS-RELM) is proposed to address the aforementioned issues. The main idea is to incorporate the regularization method to further improve its generalization performance, and a new update formula is used to eliminate the initialization phase. To enable the OS-RELM to adapt to new data in an effective and reliable manner, an efficient Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation method is implemented. Finally, a matrix reconstruction method is employed to address the unstable update issue. Unlike some \{ELM\} variants that greatly jeopardize the speed advantage of the ELM, we strive to limit the computational load from the proposed scheme. Simulation results on benchmark problems show that the OS-RELM is a reliable and efficient algorithm with superior generalization performance than the OS-ELM. "}

In this paper, we propose a highly efficient learning method for \{MI\} classification based on hierarchical extreme learning machine (ELM), called MI-ELM. Specifically, a double-hidden layers feedforward network (DLFN) is designed to serve as the \{MI\} classifier. Then, the \{MI\} classification is formulated as an optimization problem. Moreover, the output weights of \{DLFN\} can be analytically determined by solving the aforementioned optimization problem. The merits of MI-ELM are as follows: (i) MI-ELM extends the single-layer \{ELM\} to be a hierarchical one that well fits for training \{DLFNs\} in \{MI\} classification. (ii) The input and hidden-layer parameters of \{DLFNs\} are assigned randomly rather than tuned iteratively, and the output weights of \{DLFNs\} can be determined analytically in one step. Therefore, MI-ELM significantly enhances the efficiency of the \{DLFN\} without notable loss of the classification accuracy. Experimental results over several real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed MI-ELM method significantly outperforms existing kernel methods for \{MI\} classification in terms of the classification accuracy and the classification time.

Networks with deep architectures have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in a variety of settings, especially with computer vision tasks. Deep learning algorithms such as stacked autoencoder (SAE) and deep belief network (DBN) are built on learning several levels of representation of the input. Beyond simply learning features by stacking autoencoders (AE), there is a need for increasing its robustness to noise and reinforcing the sparsity of weights to make it easier to discover interesting and prominent features. The sparse \{AE\} and denoising \{AE\} was hence developed for this purpose. This paper proposes an approach: SSDAE-RR (stacked sparse denoising autoencoder – ridge regression) that effectively integrates the advantages in SAE, sparse AE, denoising AE, and the \{RR\} implementation in \{ELM\} algorithm. We conducted experimental study on real-world classification (binary and multiclass) and regression problems with different scales among several relevant approaches: SSDAE-RR, ELM, DBN, neural network (NN), and SAE. The performance analysis shows that the SSDAE-RR tends to achieve a better generalization ability on relatively large datasets (large sample size and high dimension) that were not pre-processed for feature abstraction. For 16 out of 18 tested datasets, the performance of SSDAE-RR is more stable than other tested approaches. We also note that the sparsity regularization and denoising mechanism seem to be mandatory for constructing interpretable feature representations. The fact that a SSDAE-RR approach often has a comparable training time to \{ELM\} makes it useful in some real applications. "}

Therefore it has practical significance for data analysis in real-world applications.

In this paper, an \{ELM\} model based on L1-norm and L2-norm regularizations is proposed to handle regression and multiple-class classification problems in a unified framework. The proposed model called L1–L2-ELM combines the grouping effect benefits of \{L2\} penalty and the tendency towards sparse solution of \{L1\} penalty, thus it can control the complexity of the network and prevent over-fitting. To solve the mixed penalty problem, the separate elastic net algorithm and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are adopted to find the optimal model for each response variable. We test the L1–L2-ELM algorithm on one artificial case and nine benchmark data sets to evaluate its performance. Simulation results have shown that the proposed algorithms outperform the original \{ELM\} as well as other advanced \{ELM\} algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy, and it is more robust in both regression and classification applications.

The centers of the fifth and sixth bounds are calculated on a separate subset of the training set. The last two bounds use unlabeled data to represent view agreements and are thus applicable to semi-supervised multi-view learning. We evaluate all the presented multi-view PAC-Bayes bounds on benchmark data and compare them with previous single-view PAC-Bayes bounds. The usefulness and performance of the multi-view bounds are discussed. "}

abstract = {"Abstract In order to more accurately model time-varying nonlinear systems, we propose a regularized online sequential extreme learning machine with adaptive regulation factor (ROSELM-ARF). The construction of a new objective function allows for the online updating of both the model coefficient as well as the regulation factor, while negating the influence of the cumulate error. This differs from the traditional regularized online sequential extreme learning machine (ReOS-ELM) which only updates the model coefficient. The development and application of a two-step solving method is used to determine the optimal parameters, where the optimal regulation factor is derived using the proposed fast and online leave-one-out cross validation (FOLOO) method. The computational performance could be drastically improved by using the proposed \{FOLOO\} method as compared to using the existing leave-one-out cross validation (LOO) method. The application of the proposed method in the modeling of two practical cases is done in order to demonstrate its effectiveness. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method provides a more accurate model than several conventional modeling methods, while also improving the computational performance. "}

Results indicated that the \{PAH\} adsorption could not be predicted by linear regression as the \{R2Y\} and \{Q2Y\} coefficients of \{PLS\} analysis was 0.375 and 0.199, respectively.

The main advantage of \{ELM\} lies in that the input weights as well as the hidden layer biases can be randomly generated, which contributes to the analytical solution of output weights. In this paper, we propose a discriminative manifold \{ELM\} (DMELM) by simultaneously considering the discriminative information and geometric structure of data; specifically, we exploit the discriminative information in the local neighborhood around each data point. To this end, a graph regularizer based on a newly designed graph Laplacian to characterize both properties is formulated and incorporated into the \{ELM\} objective. In DMELM, the output weights can also be obtained in analytical form. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and \{EEG\} signal classification to evaluate the effectiveness of DMELM. The results show that \{DMELM\} consistently achieves better performance than original \{ELM\} and yields promising results in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms, which suggests that both the discriminative as well as manifold information are beneficial to classification.

In contrast to inferring model parameters, this work uses inverse modeling to obtain corrective, spatially distributed functional terms, offering a route to directly address model-form errors. Once the inference has been performed over a number of problems that are representative of the deficient physics in the closure model, machine learning techniques are used to reconstruct the model corrections in terms of variables that appear in the closure model. These reconstructed functional forms are then used to augment the closure model in a predictive computational setting. As a first demonstrative example, a scalar ordinary differential equation is considered, wherein the model equation has missing and deficient terms. Following this, the methodology is extended to the prediction of turbulent channel flow. In both of these applications, the approach is demonstrated to be able to successfully reconstruct functional corrections and yield accurate predictive solutions while providing a measure of model form uncertainties.

Physical constraints and insights are enforced to the model through the solution of semi-infinite optimization and global optimization subproblems. The proposed methodology has been implemented in the \{ALAMO\} software for automated learning of algebraic models. We present extensive computational results with \{ALAMO\} and comparisons between \{ALAMO\} and a variety of machine learning techniques, including Latin hypercube sampling, simple least-squares regression, and the lasso.

However, like many other classification algorithms, \{ELM\} may learn undesirable class boundaries from data with unbalanced classes. This paper first tries to analyze the reason of the damage caused by class imbalance for ELM, and then discusses the influence of several data distribution factors for the damage. Next, we present an optimal decision outputs compensation strategy to deal with the class imbalance problem in the context of ELM. Specifically, the outputs of the minority classes in \{ELM\} are properly compensated. For a binary-class problem, the compensation can be regarded as a single variable optimization problem, thus the golden section search algorithm is adopted to find the optimal compensation value. For a multi-class problem, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve the multivariate optimization problem and to provide the optimal combination of compensations. Experimental results on lots of imbalanced data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. Statistical results indicate that the proposed approach not only outperforms the original ELM, but also yields better or at least competitive results compared with several widely used and state-of-the-art class imbalance learning methods.

Development of a fast response and accurate intelligent system for fault diagnosis of automotive engines is therefore greatly urged. The engine fault diagnosis faces challenges because of the existence of simultaneous-faults which are multiple single-faults appear concurrently. Another challenge is the high cost in acquiring the exponentially increased simultaneous-fault signals. Traditional signal-based engine fault diagnostic systems may not give reliable diagnostic results because they usually rely on single classifier and one kind of engine signal. To enhance the reliability of fault diagnosis and the number of detectable faults, this research proposes a new diagnostic framework namely probabilistic committee machine (PCM). The framework combines feature extraction (empirical mode decomposition and sample entropy), a parameter optimization algorithm, and multiple sparse Bayesian extreme learning machines (SBELM) to form an intelligent diagnostic framework. Multiple \{SBELM\} networks are built to form different domain committee members. The members are individually trained using air ratio, ignition pattern and engine sound signals. The diagnostic result from each fault detection member is then combined by using a new probabilistic ensemble method, which can improve the overall diagnostic accuracy and increase the number of detectable faults as compared to individual classifier. Experimental results show the proposed framework is superior to the existing single probabilistic classifier. Moreover, the proposed system can diagnose both single and simultaneous-faults for automotive engines while the system is trained by single-fault patterns only. "}

The proposed random effect model includes an additional variance component to accommodate correlated data and to allow for differences among clusters. Inference techniques based on Bayesian evidence procedure are derived for the estimation of model weights, random effect and residual variance parameters as well as hyperparameters. The proposed model is applied to both synthesis and real world clustered datasets.

The generalization performance and sparsity of the proposed model are also superior to those of the ME-LSSVM method. "}

Accordingly, a novel decomposition-and-ensemble learning paradigm integrating ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and extended extreme learning machine (EELM) is proposed for crude oil price forecasting, based on the principle of “decomposition and ensemble”. This novel learning model makes contribution to literature by introducing the current powerful artificial intelligent (AI) technique of \{EELM\} in the ensemble model formulation. In the proposed method, EEMD, a competitive decomposition method, is first applied to divide the original data of crude oil price time series into a number of relatively regular components, for simplicity. Second, EELM, a currently proposed, powerful, effective and stable forecasting tool, is implemented to predict all components independently. Finally, these predicted results are aggregated into an ensemble result as final prediction, using simple addition ensemble method. For illustration and verification purposes, the proposed learning paradigm is used to predict the crude oil spot price of WTI. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed novel ensemble learning paradigm statistically outperforms all considered benchmark models (including popular single models and similar ensemble models) in both prediction accuracy (in terms of level and directional measurement) and effectiveness (in terms of time saving and robustness), indicating that it is a promising tool to predict complicated time series with high volatility and irregularity.

Recently, many variants, such as parallel \{ELM\} (P-ELM) incremental \{ELM\} and online sequential ELM(OS-ELM), have been proposed to improve its timing performance and enable its ability of incremental learning. In this paper, we propose two parallel variants, termed as data parallel regularized \{ELM\} (DPR-ELM) and model parallel regularized \{ELM\} (MPR-ELM), to further improve the computational efficiency of \{ELM\} in handling large scale learning tasks. Collectively, these two variants are called as parallel regularized \{ELM\} (PR-ELM). Specifically, our proposed algorithms are implemented on cluster with Message Passing Interface (MPI) environment. In summary, the advantages of the proposed PR-ELM algorithms over existing variants are highlighted as follows: (1) They have better parallelism since they train each data block or each sub-model independently. (2) They dramatically reduce the requirement of huge runtime memory since the whole datasets or the whole model are split into small chunks or sub-models. (3) Both DPR-ELM and MPR-ELM have better scalability since they are able to be configured on clusters with many more computing nodes. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. As shown, DPR-ELM and MPR-ELM achieve 5.15× and 3.5× speedup on cluster with six nodes, respectively. Moreover, the speedup of DPR-ELM increases to 5.85× with the increase of the size of dataset, and this quantity is increased to 4× for MPR-ELM with the increase of the number of hidden nodes. "}

We propose to use online version of Extreme Learning Machine that is enhanced by an efficient drift detector and method to alleviate the bias towards the majority class. We investigate three approaches based on undersampling, oversampling and cost-sensitive adaptation. Additionally, to allow for a rapid updating of the proposed classifier we show how to implement online Extreme Learning Machines with the usage of GPU.

In the second stage, two sets of features are extracted from the remaining signals using contour-based and texture based methods. The former is based on extraction of time–frequency features from upcall contours, and the latter employs a Local Binary Pattern operator to extract distinguishing texture features of the upcalls. Subsequently evaluation phase is carried out by using several classifiers to assess the effectiveness of both the contour-based and texture-based features for upcall detection. Comparing \{ROC\} curves of machine learning algorithms obtained from Cornell University’s dataset reveals that \{LBP\} features improved performance accuracy up to 43% over time–frequency features. Classifiers such as the Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, and TreeBagger achieve highest upcall detection rates with \{LBP\} features. "}

Uncontrolled epilepsy poses a significant burden to society due to associated healthcare cost to treat and control the unpredictable and spontaneous occurrence of seizures. The objective of this research is to develop and present a novel classification framework that is utilised to discriminate interictal and preictal brain activities via quantitative analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. New method Sample entropy-based features were extracted in parallel from 6 intracranial \{EEG\} channels, and then these features were fed to the extreme learning machine model for classification. Performance was evaluated on the basis of sensitivity and specificity and validation was performed using stratified cross-validation approach. Results The proposed method can correctly distinguish interictal and preictal \{EEGs\} with a sensitivity of 86.75% and a specificity of 83.80%, on average, across 21 patients and 6 epileptic seizure origins. Comparison with existing method Compared with traditional variance-based feature extraction, the proposed SampEn-based feature extraction method not only shows a significant improvement in the accuracy, but also has higher classification robustness and stability in terms of the much lower standard errors of classification accuracies across different evaluation periods. In addition, the proposed classification framework runs around 20 times faster than the support vector machine model during testing. Conclusions The high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method makes it feasible to extend it to the development of a real-time EEG-based brain monitoring system for epileptic seizure prediction.

This approach uncovered 1,221 genotype-specific inhibitors, which we termed cryptagens. Synergism between 8,128 structurally disparate cryptagen pairs was assessed experimentally and used to benchmark predictive algorithms. A model based on the chemical-genetic matrix and the genetic interaction network failed to accurately predict synergism. However, a combined random forest and Naive Bayesian learner that associated chemical structural features with genotype-specific growth inhibition had strong predictive power. This approach identified previously unknown compound combinations that exhibited species-selective toxicity toward human fungal pathogens. This work demonstrates that machine learning methods trained on unbiased chemical-genetic interaction data may be widely applicable for the discovery of synergistic combinations in different species.

Tidal change is a time-varying process whose dynamics vary with changes of internal and environmental factors such as celestial bodies movements, coastal topology and environmental disturbances. When OS-ELM is implemented for identifying time-varying system dynamics, it usually sequentially selects samples with fixed number. Under such circumstance, samples representing different system dynamics are mixed together so that the online representation and prediction abilities of OS-ELM may be deteriorated. To consciously select samples with most representing ability and construct appropriate sampling pool for OS-ELM, in this study, a dynamic sampling pool selection scheme is proposed based on \{IGG\} fuzzy segmentation approach. Time series of input and output variables are segmented as per their dynamics characteristics. The change points split up the time series into several segments and the change points themselves represent the changes of system dynamics. Samples within the same segment are considered as possessing homogeneous characteristics. To achieve best representing abilities for current system dynamics, the proposed IGG-based sampling scheme is implemented for selecting sampling pool. The OS-ELM selects homogeneous samples from sampling pool thus possesses better representing ability for current dynamics. In the meantime, conventional harmonic analysis is also applied to represent the influences of celestial bodies and coastal topology. The harmonic method and IGG-based OS-ELM are combined together and the resulted modular prediction scheme is applied for online tidal level prediction of ports of King Point, Mokuoloe and Old Port Tampa in the United States. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed sampling scheme and the modular tidal prediction approach. "}

Many \{MIL\} methods exist, but they often suffer from high computation complexity and the key information from \{MIL\} being ignored, which deteriorates the classification performance. Recently, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), with its high scalability, has shown the ability in enhancing \{MIL\} performance. However, for these LSH-based methods, the fixed number of bits is used to represent each projected dimension, resulting in subtle information loss and the algorithm performance reduction. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive \{LSH\} encoding method for MIL, termed as SALE. \{SALE\} uses \{LSH\} to generate the primary batches, followed by a self-adaptive process for reconstruction. Reconstructed bags are transformed into random super histograms (RSH) using an incomplete coding method, and then weighted through a scheme that takes advantage of key instances. These weighted \{RSHs\} are used to train the learning model. \{SALE\} efficiently deals with large \{MIL\} problems, due to its low complexity and RSH’s ability to exploit key information of MIL. Experiments demonstrate SALE’s good performance compared to state-of-the-art \{MIL\} methods. "}

As industrial processes are time-varying, on-line learning algorithms should be adaptive to capture process changes. On-line ensemble methods have been shown to provide better generalization performance than single models in changing environments. However, most on-line ensembles do not include and exclude models during on-line operation. As a result, the ensembles have limited adaptation capability. Moreover, a higher performance can be obtained by combining a selected set of most relevant models of the ensemble for the current situation, rather than combining all the models. This paper proposes a new on-line learning ensemble of regressor models using an ordered aggregation (OA) technique which is able to provide on-line predictions of variables in changing environments. \{OA\} dynamically selects an optimal size and composition of a subset of models based on the minimization of the ensemble error on the newest sample. The proposed strategy overcomes the problem of defining the optimal ensemble size, and in most cases it obtains better performance than aggregating all the models. Models are added or removed for assuring adaptation of the ensemble in changing environments. Furthermore, this paper proposes and integrates a new on-line Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) neural network model with variable forgetting factor (FF) using the directional \{FF\} method which shows superior performance in industrial applications when compared to the well-known On-line Sequential \{ELM\} (OS-ELM) algorithm. Experiments are reported to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods. "}

abstract = {"AbstractBackground and objectives Labeling instances by domain experts for classification is often time consuming and expensive. To reduce such labeling efforts, we had proposed the application of active learning (AL) methods, introduced our CAESAR-ALE framework for classifying the severity of clinical conditions, and shown its significant reduction of labeling efforts. The use of any of three \{AL\} methods (one well known [SVM-Margin], and two that we introduced [Exploitation and Combination_XA]) significantly reduced (by 48% to 64%) condition labeling efforts, compared to standard passive (random instance-selection) \{SVM\} learning. Furthermore, our new \{AL\} methods achieved maximal accuracy using 12% fewer labeled cases than the SVM-Margin \{AL\} method. However, because labelers have varying levels of expertise, a major issue associated with learning methods, and \{AL\} methods in particular, is how to best to use the labeling provided by a committee of labelers. First, we wanted to know, based on the labelers’ learning curves, whether using \{AL\} methods (versus standard passive learning methods) has an effect on the Intra-labeler variability (within the learning curve of each labeler) and inter-labeler variability (among the learning curves of different labelers). Then, we wanted to examine the effect of learning (either passively or actively) from the labels created by the majority consensus of a group of labelers. Methods We used our CAESAR-ALE framework for classifying the severity of clinical conditions, the three \{AL\} methods and the passive learning method, as mentioned above, to induce the classifications models. We used a dataset of 516 clinical conditions and their severity labeling, represented by features aggregated from the medical records of 1.9 million patients treated at Columbia University Medical Center. We analyzed the variance of the classification performance within (intra-labeler), and especially among (inter-labeler) the classification models that were induced by using the labels provided by seven labelers. We also compared the performance of the passive and active learning models when using the consensus label. Results The \{AL\} methods: produced, for the models induced from each labeler, smoother Intra-labeler learning curves during the training phase, compared to the models produced when using the passive learning method. The mean standard deviation of the learning curves of the three \{AL\} methods over all labelers (mean: 0.0379; range: [0.0182 to 0.0496]), was significantly lower (p = 0.049) than the Intra-labeler standard deviation when using the passive learning method (mean: 0.0484; range: [0.0275–0.0724). Using the \{AL\} methods resulted in a lower mean Inter-labeler \{AUC\} standard deviation among the \{AUC\} values of the labelers’ different models during the training phase, compared to the variance of the induced models’ \{AUC\} values when using passive learning. The Inter-labeler \{AUC\} standard deviation, using the passive learning method (0.039), was almost twice as high as the Inter-labeler standard deviation using our two new \{AL\} methods (0.02 and 0.019, respectively). The SVM-Margin \{AL\} method resulted in an Inter-labeler standard deviation (0.029) that was higher by almost 50% than that of our two \{AL\} methods The difference in the inter-labeler standard deviation between the passive learning method and the SVM-Margin learning method was significant (p = 0.042). The difference between the SVM-Margin and Exploitation method was insignificant (p = 0.29), as was the difference between the Combination_XA and Exploitation methods (p = 0.67). Finally, using the consensus label led to a learning curve that had a higher mean intra-labeler variance, but resulted eventually in an \{AUC\} that was at least as high as the \{AUC\} achieved using the gold standard label and that was always higher than the expected mean \{AUC\} of a randomly selected labeler, regardless of the choice of learning method (including a passive learning method). Using a paired t-test, the difference between the intra-labeler \{AUC\} standard deviation when using the consensus label, versus that value when using the other two labeling strategies, was significant only when using the passive learning method (p = 0.014), but not when using any of the three \{AL\} methods. Conclusions The use of \{AL\} methods, (a) reduces intra-labeler variability in the performance of the induced models during the training phase, and thus reduces the risk of halting the process at a local minimum that is significantly different in performance from the rest of the learned models; and (b) reduces Inter-labeler performance variance, and thus reduces the dependence on the use of a particular labeler. In addition, the use of a consensus label, agreed upon by a rather uneven group of labelers, might be at least as good as using the gold standard labeler, who might not be available, and certainly better than randomly selecting one of the group’s individual labelers. Finally, using the \{AL\} methods: when provided by the consensus label reduced the intra-labeler \{AUC\} variance during the learning phase, compared to using passive learning. "}

Ensemble methods can use a number of \{ML\} methods to come to a consensus classification. \{ML\} classifications are often 100% accurate, but most implementations have been used in classifying into only two groups.

Different from the common understanding of learning, it is revealed that when the number of the hidden nodes of every hidden layer and the type of the adopted kernel based activation functions are pre-fixed, a special kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is always implicitly executed, which can result in the fact that all the hidden layers of such networks need not be tuned and their parameters can be randomly assigned and even may be independent of the training data. Therefore, the least learning machine (LLM) is extended into its generalized version in the sense of adopting much more error functions rather than mean squared error (MSE) function only. As an additional merit, it is also revealed that rigorous Mercer kernel condition is not required in \{FKNN\} networks. When the proposed architecture of \{FKNN\} networks is constructed in a layer-by-layer way, i.e., the number of the hidden nodes of every hidden layer may be determined only in terms of the extracted principal components after the explicit execution of a KPCA, we can develop FKNN's deep architecture such that its deep learning framework (DLF) has strong theoretical guarantee. Our experimental results about image classification manifest that the proposed FKNN's deep architecture and its \{DLF\} based learning indeed enhance the classification performance. "}

Some models show greater adaptability to different modelling conditions, with only a few approaches able to predict with high accuracy using limited input variables (scenario 2).

This type of interaction becomes necessary as we reflect upon the practical implications of the model construction. To this extent, I review a specific set of contributions of philosophy to machine learning in determining epistemic standing of object representation and algorithmic design. I discuss three aspects of statistical models, pertaining to semantics of object representation, namely idealization (simplifying properties of an object), abstraction (representing an object with another object that is easier to handle), and use of latent variables. I argue to what extent these aspects necessitate philosophical attention to justify their practical use. To this end, I elucidate different philosophical concepts that are utilized by researchers mostly tacitly when dealing with uncertainties in features and their functional relationships. This is expected to help pave the way for further investigations on semantics of object representation in machine learning. "}

abstract = {"AbstractBackground To date, there are no reviews on machine learning (ML) in burn care. Considering the growth of \{ML\} in medicine and the complexities and challenges of burn care, this review specializes on \{ML\} applications in burn care. The objective was to examine the features and impact of applications in targeting various aspects of burn care and research. Methods MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ScienceDirect, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles were searched for studies involving burn care/research and machine learning. Data were abstracted on study design, study size, year, population, application of burn care/research, \{ML\} technique(s), and algorithm performance. Results 15 retrospective observational studies involving burn patients met inclusion criteria. In total 5105 patients with acute thermal injury, 171 clinical burn wounds, 180 9-mer peptides, and 424 12-mer peptides were included in the studies. Studies focused on burn diagnosis (n = 5), aminoglycoside response (n = 3), hospital length of stay (n = 2), survival/mortality (n = 4), burn healing time (n = 1), and antimicrobial peptides in burn patients (n = 1). Of these 15 studies, 11 used artificial neural networks. Importantly, all studies demonstrated the benefits of \{ML\} in burn care/research and superior performance over traditional statistical methods. However, algorithm performance was assessed differently by different authors. Feature selection varied among studies, but studies with similar applications shared specific features including age, gender, presence of inhalation injury, total body surface area burned, and when available, various degrees of burns, infections, and previous histories/conditions of burn patients. Conclusion A common feature base may be determined for \{ML\} in burn care/research, but the impact of \{ML\} will require further validation in prospective observational studies and randomized clinical trials, establishment of common performance metrics, and high quality evidence about clinical and economic impacts. Only then can \{ML\} applications be advanced and accepted widely in burn care/research. "}

Examples of such information include users’ locations, events, activities, and the co-presence of others in proximity. When disclosing personal information, users take into account several factors to balance privacy, utility and convenience — they want to share the “right” amount and type of information at each time, thus revealing a selective sharing behavior depending on the context, with a minimum amount of user interaction. In this article, we present SPISM, a novel information-sharing system that decides (semi-)automatically, based on personal and contextual features, whether to share information with others and at what granularity, whenever it is requested. \{SPISM\} makes use of (active) machine-learning techniques, including cost-sensitive multi-class classifiers based on support vector machines. \{SPISM\} provides both ease of use and privacy features: It adapts to each user’s behavior and predicts the level of detail for each sharing decision. Based on a personalized survey about information sharing, which involves 70 participants, our results provide insight into the most influential features behind a sharing decision, the reasons users share different types of information and their confidence in such decisions. We show that \{SPISM\} outperforms other kinds of policies; it achieves a median proportion of correct sharing decisions of 72% (after only 40 manual decisions). We also show that \{SPISM\} can be optimized to gracefully balance utility and privacy, but at the cost of a slight decrease in accuracy. Finally, we assess the potential of a one-size-fits-all version of SPISM. "}

We first motivate the importance of ranking \{RDF\} properties by providing two killer applications for the problem, namely property tagging and entity visualization. Moved by the desiderata of these applications, we propose to apply Machine Learning to Rank (MLR) techniques to the problem of ranking \{RDF\} properties. Our devised solution is based on a deep empirical study of all the dimensions involved: feature selection, \{MLR\} algorithm and Model training. The major advantages of our approach are the following: (a) flexibility/personalization, as the properties’ relevance can be user-specified by personalizing the training set in a supervised approach, or set by a novel automatic classification approach based on SWiPE; (b) speed, since it can be applied without computing frequencies over the whole dataset, leveraging existing fast \{MLR\} algorithms; (c) effectiveness, as it can be applied even when no ontology data is available by using novel dataset-independent features; (d) precision, which is high both in terms of f-measure and Spearman’s rho. Experimental results show that the proposed \{MLR\} framework outperform the two existing approaches found in literature which are related to \{RDF\} property ranking. "}

This paper addresses a significant note of inefficiency in methods for regression when dealing with outliers, especially for cases with polarity of noise involved (i.e., one sided noise with either only positive noise or negative noise). Using soft margin loss function concept, we propose Constrained Optimization method based Extreme Learning Machine for Regression, hereafter denoted as CO-ELM-R. The proposed method incorporates the two Lagrange multipliers that mimic Support Vector Regression (SVR) into the basis of \{ELM\} to cope with infeasible constraints of the regression optimization problem. Thus, CO-ELM-R will complement the recursive iterations of \{SVR\} in the training phase due to the fact that \{ELM\} is much simpler in structure and faster in implementation. The proposed CO-ELM-R is evaluated empirically on a few benchmark data sets and a real world application of \{NOx\} gas emission data set collected from one of the power plant in Malaysia. The obtained results have demonstrated its validity and efficacy in handling noisy data regression problems. "}

Characterised by sudden bursts of excess electricity in the brain, manifesting as seizures, epilepsy is still not well understood when compared with other neurological disorders. Seizures often happen unexpectedly and attempting to predict them has been a research topic for the last 30 years. Electroencephalograms have been integral to these studies, as the recordings that they produce can capture the brain’s electrical signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist, but can be difficult to make in the early stages. Supporting para-clinical evidence obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalogram capture and interpretation is time consuming and can be expensive due to the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated detection of correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regions of the brain and across multiple subjects may be a solution. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and non-seizure records using an open dataset containing 342 records (171 seizures and 171 non-seizures). Our approach posits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjects without prior knowledge about the focal point of seizures. Our results show an improvement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for specificity and 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-NN classifier. "}

Generally, active learning is applied in the scenario that lots of instances are easy to be acquired, but labeling them is expensive and/or time-consuming. In this study, we try to implement active learning by using extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier based on three reasons as follows: (1) \{ELM\} has light computational costs, (2) \{ELM\} has strong generalization ability which is even comparable with support vector machine (SVM) and (3) \{ELM\} could be directly applied on both binary-class and multiclass problems. Specifically, an active learning algorithm based on \{ELM\} classifier named AL-ELM is proposed in this paper. During active learning, AL-ELM estimates the uncertainty of each unlabeled instance by creating a mapping relation between the actual outputs of the instance in \{ELM\} and the approximated membership probability of the same instance. In other words, \{ELM\} is converted as the equivalent Bayes classifier. On each iteration, those most uncertain instances are extracted and labeled to promote the quality of classification model. The learning procedure stops until it satisfies a pre-designed criterion. Experimental results on 20 benchmark data sets show that AL-ELM is better than or at least comparable to several state-of-the-art uncertainty-based active learning algorithms. Also, in contrast with several other algorithms, AL-ELM could effectively decrease the running time of learning procedure. "}

This chapter shows an alternative for the combination of machine learning techniques, evolutionary computation, and geological interpretations to decrease uncertainties in identifying the location of favorable reservoirs. For this purpose, seismic and well log data from a sand Brazilian field were analyzed. The identification of sandy facies as conducers was made by means of self-organizing maps and extrapolated into signals of seismic data by probabilistic neural networks, converting the image of original amplitude into rock properties. The genetic algorithm was also tested to evaluate different seismic attributes among a group of 37 possibilities to perform the facies prediction task. The image description by multiattributes allowed the definition of the facies distribution modeling. The same process was applied to predict the probability of porosity distribution in seismic data by multilayer perceptron and generalized regression, once again using the genetic algorithm. Through these properties, models from two favorable areas of reservoir were identified in the southwest part of the field. Core description corroborates with the results found by the suggested methodology, indicating its satisfactory application. "}

The problem is formulated into a bi-objective mixed integer mathematical model in which several parameters are supposed to follow triangular possibility distributions. Converting the aforementioned model, an auxiliary equivalent mixed integer crisp one is constructed through an interactive possiblistic programming approach. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, swarm intelligence is hired by applying a highly modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. In the proposed evolutionary method, called Lévy Flight Embedded Particle Swarm Optimization (LFEPSO), uniformly distributed walks are replaced by Lévy flights. In order to check the validity of the model and the performance of the proposed LFEPSO, twenty-six data sets are generated on a random basis. As the numerical results indicate, embedding Lévy flights made a tremendous improvement towards solving the local optima problem of the traditional PSO. Compared to the exact solution method, \{LFEPSO\} has shown an outstanding performance in scheduling 8–500 jobs on 3–50 parallel processors. In addition, numerical results reveal the significant role of considering the adapting ability in accurately modeling real-world and huge-sized problems. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Building detection from aerial images has many applications in fields like urban planning, real-estate management, and disaster relief. In the last two decades, a large variety of methods on automatic building detection have been proposed in the remote sensing literature. Many of these approaches make use of local features to classify each pixel or segment to an object label, therefore involving an extra step to fuse pixelwise decisions. This paper presents a generic framework that exploits recent advances in image segmentation and region descriptors extraction for the automatic and accurate detection of buildings on aerial orthophotos. The proposed solution is supervised in the sense that appearances of buildings are learnt from examples. For the first time in the context of building detection, we use the matrix covariance descriptor, which proves to be very informative and compact. Moreover, we introduce a principled evaluation that allows selecting the best pair segmentation algorithm-region descriptor for the task of building detection. Finally, we provide a performance evaluation at pixel level using different classifiers. This evaluation is conducted over 200 buildings using different segmentation algorithms and descriptors. The performance analysis quantifies the quality of both the image segmentation and the descriptor used. The proposed approach presents several advantages in terms of scalability, suitability and simplicity with respect to the existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed scheme (detection chain and evaluation) can be deployed for detecting multiple object categories that are present in images and can be used by intelligent systems requiring scene perception and parsing such as intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle navigation and automatic 3D city modeling.

abstract = {"Abstract In the cardiovascular system, blood flow rates, blood velocities and blood pressures can be modeled using the Navier–Stokes equations. Inputs to the system are typically uncertain, such as (a) the geometry of the arterial tree, (b) clinically measured blood pressure and viscosity, (c) boundary resistances, among others. Due to a large number of such parameters, efficient quantification of uncertainty in solution fields in this multi-parameter space is challenging. We use an adaptive stochastic collocation method to quantify the impact of uncertainty in geometry in patient-specific models. We develop a novel subdivision method to define the stochastic space of geometries. To accelerate convergence and make the problem tractable, we use a machine learning approach to approximate the simulation-based solution. Towards this, a reduced order model of the Navier–Stokes equations is developed using a segmental resistance analog boundary conditions (ratio of pressure to flow). Using an offline database of pre-computed solutions, we compute a map (rule) from the features to solution fields. We achieve significant speed-up (of a few orders of magnitude) by approximating the simulation-based solution using a machine learning predictor. A bootstrap aggregated decision tree was found to be the best predictor among many candidate regressors (correlation coefficient of training set was 0.94). We demonstrate stochastic space convergence using the adaptive stochastic collocation method, and also show robustness to the choice of geometry parameterization. The sensitivities to geometry obtained using machine learning had a correlation coefficient of 0.92 with the values obtained using finite element simulations. Segments with significant disease in the larger arteries had the highest sensitivities. Terminal segments are more sensitive to dilation and proximal healthy segments are more sensitive to erosion. Sensitivity to geometry is highest when geometric resistance is comparable to net downstream resistance. "}

abstract = {"Abstract This paper introduces a framework of granular neural networks named rough rule granular extreme learning machine (RRGELM), and develops its comprehensive design process. The proposed granular neural networks are formed on the basis of rough decision rules extracted from training samples through rough set theory. Firstly, Sample data are reduced by the algorithms of attributes reduction and attributes values reduction in rough set theory, and then they are compressed to an irredundant data set. In this data set, each sample can represent a rough rule, and is expressed as an If-Then rule which indicates the relationship between the input and output pattern. Moreover, the confidence level and the coverage level of each rule are calculated. Secondly, granular-neurons can be constructed through the If-Then rules, and all the granular-neurons constitute rule matching layer which is regarded as the hidden layer of the RRGELM. The linked weights between the input neurons and granular-neurons can be determined by the confidences of rough decision rules, while the linked weights between the output neurons and granular-neurons can be initialized as the contributions of the rough rules to the classification. Finally, the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is introduced to improve the learning speed of the RRGELM, rather than the \{BP\} algorithm used by other traditional \{GNN\} models. Good performance of the proposed \{RRGELM\} is demonstrated on several well-known benchmark data sets. "}

This is often composed by misleading information, advertisements, viruses, and malwares that can be harmful and annoying to users. The dynamic nature of spam messages demands for knowledge-based systems with online learning and, therefore, the most traditional text categorization techniques can not be used. In this study, we introduce the MDLText, a text classifier based on the minimum description length principle, to the context of filtering undesired short text messages. The proposed approach supports incremental learning and, therefore, its predictive model is scalable and can adapt to continuously evolving spamming techniques. It is also fast, with computational cost increasing linearly with the number of samples and features, which is very desirable for expert systems applied to real-time electronic communication. In addition to the dynamic nature of these messages, they are also short and usually poorly written, rife with slangs, symbols, and abbreviations that difficult text representation, learning, and filtering. In this scenario, we also investigated the benefits of using text normalization and semantic indexing techniques. We showed these techniques can improve the text content quality and, consequently, enhance the performance of the expert systems for spamming detection. Based on these findings, we propose a new hybrid ensemble approach that combines the predictions obtained by the classifiers using the original text samples along with their variations created by applying text normalization and semantic indexing techniques. It has the advantages of being independent of the classification method and the results indicated it is efficient to filter undesired short text messages. "}

abstract = {"Abstract The majority of the human genome consists of non-coding regions that have been called junk DNA. However, recent studies have unveiled that these regions contain cis-regulatory elements, such as promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, etc. These regulatory elements can play crucial roles in controlling gene expressions in specific cell types, conditions, and developmental stages. Disruption to these regions could contribute to phenotype changes. Precisely identifying regulatory elements is key to deciphering the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation. Cis-regulatory events are complex processes that involve chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, \{DNA\} methylation, histone modifications, and the interactions between them. The development of next-generation sequencing techniques has allowed us to capture these genomic features in depth. Applied analysis of genome sequences for clinical genetics has increased the urgency for detecting these regions. However, the complexity of cis-regulatory events and the deluge of sequencing data require accurate and efficient computational approaches, in particular, machine learning techniques. In this review, we describe machine learning approaches for predicting transcription factor binding sites, enhancers, and promoters, primarily driven by next-generation sequencing data. Data sources are provided in order to facilitate testing of novel methods. The purpose of this review is to attract computational experts and data scientists to advance this field. "}

The number of discrete \{REMs\} over time, or \{REM\} density, has been investigated as a marker of clinical psychopathology and memory consolidation. However, human detection of \{REMs\} is a time-consuming and subjective process. Therefore, reliable, automated \{REM\} detection software is a valuable research tool. New method We developed an automatic \{REM\} detection algorithm combining a novel set of extracted features and the ‘AdaBoost’ classification algorithm to detect the presence of \{REMs\} in Electrooculogram data collected from the right and left outer canthi (ROC/LOC). Algorithm performance measures of Recall (percentage of \{REMs\} detected) and Precision (percentage of \{REMs\} detected that are true REMs) were calculated and compared to the gold standard of human detection by three expert sleep scorers. \{REM\} detection by four non-experts were also investigated and compared to expert raters and the algorithm. Results The algorithm performance (78.1% Recall, 82.6% Precision) surpassed that of the average (expert &amp; non-expert) single human detection performance (76% Recall, 83% Precision). Agreement between non-experts (Cronbach Alpha = 0.65) is markedly lower than experts (Cronbach Alpha = 0.80). Comparison with existing method(s) By following reported methods, we implemented all previously published \{LOC\} and \{ROC\} based detection algorithms on our dataset. Our algorithm performance exceeded all others. Conclusions The automatic detection algorithm presented is a viable and efficient method of \{REM\} detection as it reliably matches the performance of human scorers and outperforms all other known LOC- and ROC-based detection algorithms.

Machine learning has emerged as a suitable tool to improve classic stepwise \{MLR\} results on LiDAR. Unfortunately, few studies have been proposed to compare the quality of the multiple machine learning approaches. This paper presents a comparison between the classic MLR-based methodology and regression techniques in machine learning (neural networks, support vector machines, nearest neighbour, ensembles such as random forests) with special emphasis on regression trees. The selected techniques are applied to real LiDAR data from two areas in the province of Lugo (Galizia, Spain). The results confirm that classic \{MLR\} is outperformed by machine learning techniques and concretely, our experiments suggest that Support Vector Regression with Gaussian kernels statistically outperforms the rest of the techniques.

Since \{EEG\} signals are non-stationary and present evident dynamic characteristics, conventional linear approaches are not highly successful in recognition of drowsy level. Furthermore, previous methods cannot produce satisfying results without considering the basic rhythms underlying the raw signals. To address these drawbacks, we propose a system for drowsiness detection using physiological signals that present four advantages: (1) decomposing \{EEG\} signals into wavelet sub-bands to extract more evident information beyond raw signals, (2) extraction and fusion of nonlinear features from \{EEG\} sub-bands, (3) fusion the information from \{EEGs\} and eyelid movements, (4) employing efficient extremely learning machine for status classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves not only a high detection accuracy but also a very fast computation speed. The proposed algorithm can be further developed into the monitoring and warning systems to prevent the accumulation of mental fatigue and declines of work efficiency in many environments such as vehicular driving, aviation, navigation and medical service.

More than 50% of falls in healthy older adults are due to tripping while walking. Minimum toe clearance (i.e., minimum height of the toe above the ground during the mid-swing phase - MTC) has been investigated as an indicator of tripping risk. There is increasing demand for practicable gait monitoring using wearable sensors such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) comprising accelerometers and gyroscopes due to their wearability, compactness and low cost. A major limitation however, is intrinsic noise making acceleration integration unreliable and inaccurate for estimating \{MTC\} height from \{IMU\} data. A machine learning approach to \{MTC\} height estimation was investigated in this paper incorporating features from both raw and integrated inertial signals to train Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) models using a hill-climbing feature-selection method. The \{GRNN\} based \{MTC\} height predictions demonstrated root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 6.6 mm with 9 optimum features for young adults and 7.1 mm \{RMSE\} with 5 features for the older adults during treadmill walking. The \{GRNN\} based \{MTC\} height estimation method devised in this project represents approximately 68% less \{RMSE\} than other estimation techniques. The research findings show a strong potential for gait monitoring outside the laboratory to provide real-time \{MTC\} height information during everyday locomotion. "}

The first strategy involves ignoring the vertex labels that have a low frequency among the instances. Our second strategy is to remove hubs to simplify the \{RDF\} graphs. We test our kernels in a number of classification experiments with real-world \{RDF\} datasets. Overall the kernels that count subtrees show the best performance. However, they are closely followed by simple bag of labels baseline kernels. The direct kernels substantially decrease computation time, while keeping performance the same. For the walks counting kernel this decrease in computation time is so large that it thereby becomes a computationally viable kernel to use. Ignoring low frequency labels improves the performance for all datasets. The hub removal algorithm increases performance on two out of three of our smaller datasets, but has little impact when used on our larger datasets. "}

Learning in \{MLM\} consists in building a linear mapping between input and output distance matrices. In the generalization phase, the learned distance map is used to provide an estimate of the distance from K output reference points to the unknown target output value. Then, the output estimation is formulated as multilateration problem based on the predicted output distance and the locations of the reference points. Given its general formulation, the Minimal Learning Machine is inherently capable of operating on nonlinear regression problems as well as on multidimensional response spaces. In addition, an intuitive extension of the \{MLM\} is proposed to deal with classification problems. A comprehensive set of computer experiments illustrates that the proposed method achieves accuracies that are comparable to more traditional machine learning methods for regression and classification thus offering a computationally valid alternative to such approaches.

In this paper, we present our text mining systems for these tasks and evaluate their results on the DDI-Extraction benchmarks. Our systems rely on machine learning techniques using both feature-based and kernel-based methods. The obtained results for drug name recognition are encouraging. For DDI-Extraction, our hybrid system combining a feature-based method and a kernel-based method was ranked second in the DDI-Extraction-2011 challenge, and our two-step system for \{DDI\} detection and classification was ranked first in the DDI-Extraction-2013 task at SemEval. We discuss our methods and results and give pointers to future work. "}

The upper bound of the misclassification error is estimated for the \{ELM\} classification showing that the satisfactory learning rate can be achieved even for the dependent samples. Empirical evaluations on real-word datasets are provided to compare the predictive performance of \{ELM\} with independent and Markov sampling. "}

This article proposes functional networks based on propensity score and Newton Raphson-maximum-likelihood optimizations as a new large-scale machine learning classifier to enhance its performance in addressing these challenges within big biomedical data. Different use-cases scenarios based on integrated phenotypic and genomics big biomedical data were proposed: real-life biomedical data, (i) optimal design of cancer chemotherapy; (ii) identify inpatient-admission of individuals with primary diagnosis of cancer; (iii) identify severe asthma exacerbation children using integrated phenotypic and \{SNP\} repository data; and (iv) mixture models simulation studies. Comparative studies were carried to compare the performance of the new paradigm versus the common state-of-the-art of machine learning, data mining, and statistics schemes. The results of performance of the new classifier with the most common classifiers on the four benchmark databases have been recorded in tables and graphs. The obtained results of the new classifier outperform most of existing state-of-the art statistical machine learning schemes with reliable and efficient performance.

The major drawback in microarray data is the “curse of dimensionality problem,” which hinders the useful information of a data set and leads to computational instability. Therefore, selecting relevant genes is a challenging task in microarray data analysis. Most of the existing schemes employ a two-stage process: feature selection (FS) followed by classification. Various methods such as t-test, F-test, Wilcoxon test, signal-to-noise ratio, χ2-test, information gain (IG), Gini index, and Fisher score are used for selecting the significant features. Moreover, different classifiers like logistic regression, naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, artificial neural network, radial basis function network, probabilistic neural network, and support vector machine have already been executed for classifying the data set. In this chapter, a permutation of several \{FS\} methods and classifiers has been implemented independently, and the finest pair is chosen based on experimental analysis using certain performance parameters for the designed classifiers. The obtained results are compared with existing schemes. The main objective of this study is to survey the already applied intelligent techniques and point out their limitations and advantages. "}

For this purpose, the capability of developed \{ELM\} method is appraised statistically for prediction of monthly mean daily \{HGSR\} using three different types of input parameters: (1) sunshine duration-based (SDB), (2) difference temperature-based (TB) and (3) multiple parameters-based (MPB). The long-term measured data sets collected for city of Shiraz situated in the Fars province of Iran have been utilized as a case study. The predicted \{HGSR\} via \{ELM\} is compared with those of support vector machine (SVM), genetic programming (GP) and artificial neural network (ANN) to ensure the precision of ELM. It is found that higher accuracy can be obtained by multiple parameters-based estimation of \{HGSR\} using all techniques. The computational results prove that \{ELM\} is highly accurate and reliable and shows higher performance than SVM, \{GP\} and ANN. For multiple parameters-based \{ELM\} model, the mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute bias error, root mean square error, relative root mean square error and coefficient of determination are obtained as 2.2518%, 0.4343 MJ/m2, 0.5882 MJ/m2, 2.9757% and 0.9865, respectively. By conducting a further verification, it is found that the \{ELM\} method also offers high superiority over four empirical models established for this study and an intelligent model from the literature. In the final analysis, a proper sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the influence of considered input elements on \{HGSR\} prediction in which the results reveal the significance of appropriate selection of input parameters to boost the accuracy of \{HGSR\} prediction by the \{ELM\} algorithm. In a nutshell, the comparative results clearly specify that \{ELM\} technique can provide reliable predictions with further precision compared to the existing techniques. "}

Simple automated algorithms were used to estimate the parameters (e.g. number of hidden neurons) needed for model training. Scaling the range of the random weights in \{ELM\} improved its performance. Excluding large datasets (with large number of cases and predictors), \{ELM\} tended to be the fastest among the nonlinear models. For large datasets, \{RF\} tended to be the fastest. \{ANN\} and \{ELM\} had similar skills, but \{ELM\} was much faster than \{ANN\} except for large datasets.

However, these studies did not explore the sensitivities of the \{ML\} algorithms relative to \{ML\} inputs in order to determine the behavior and performance of each algorithm. In this current study, normalized sensitivity coefficients are computed to diagnose \{ML\} performance as a function of time and space. The results showed that when using the ANN, approximately 20% of locations across North America are relatively sensitive to snow water equivalent (SWE). However, more than 65% of locations in the SVM-based brightness temperature (Tb) estimates are sensitive relative to perturbations in \{SWE\} at all frequency and polarization combinations explored in this study. Further, the SVM-based results suggest the algorithm is sensitive in both shallow and deep SWE, \{SWE\} with and without overlying forest canopy, and during both the snow accumulation and snow ablation seasons. Therefore, these findings suggest that compared with the ANN, the \{SVM\} could potentially serve as a more efficient and effective measurement model operator within a Tb data assimilation framework for the purpose of improving \{SWE\} estimates across regional- and continental-scales.

This paper studies seven machine learning (ML) classifiers for influenza detection, compares their diagnostic capabilities against an expert-built influenza Bayesian classifier, and evaluates different ways of handling missing clinical information from the free-text reports. We identified 31,268 \{ED\} reports from 4 hospitals between 2008 and 2011 to form two different datasets: training (468 cases, 29,004 controls), and test (176 cases and 1620 controls). We employed Topaz, a natural language processing (NLP) tool, to extract influenza-related findings and to encode them into one of three values: Acute, Non-acute, and Missing. Results show that all \{ML\} classifiers had areas under \{ROCs\} (AUC) ranging from 0.88 to 0.93, and performed significantly better than the expert-built Bayesian model. Missing clinical information marked as a value of missing (not missing at random) had a consistently improved performance among 3 (out of 4) \{ML\} classifiers when it was compared with the configuration of not assigning a value of missing (missing completely at random). The case/control ratios did not affect the classification performance given the large number of training cases. Our study demonstrates \{ED\} reports in conjunction with the use of \{ML\} and \{NLP\} with the handling of missing value information have a great potential for the detection of infectious diseases.

Image classification approaches have been developed to identify and classify glandular regions in digital images of prostate tissues; however their success has been limited by difficulties in cellular segmentation and tissue heterogeneity. We hypothesized that utilizing image pixels to generate intensity histograms of hematoxylin (H) and eosin (E) stains deconvoluted from H&amp;E images numerically captures the architectural difference between glands and stroma. In addition, we postulated that joint histograms of local binary patterns and local variance (LBPxVAR) can be used as sensitive textural features to differentiate benign/normal tissue from cancer. Here we utilized a machine learning approach comprising of a support vector machine (SVM) followed by a random forest (RF) classifier to digitally stratify prostate tissue into ST, \{BN\} and \{PCa\} areas. Two pathologists manually annotated 210 images of low- and high-grade tumors from slides that were selected from 20 radical prostatectomies and digitized at high-resolution. The 210 images were split into the training (n = 19) and test (n = 191) sets. Local intensity histograms of H and E were used to train a \{SVM\} classifier to separate \{ST\} from epithelium (BN + PCa). The performance of \{SVM\} prediction was evaluated by measuring the accuracy of delineating epithelial areas. The Jaccard J = 59.5 ± 14.6 and Rand Ri = 62.0 ± 7.5 indices reported a significantly better prediction when compared to a reference method (Chen et al., Clinical Proteomics 2013, 10:18) based on the averaged values from the test set. To distinguish \{BN\} from \{PCa\} we trained a \{RF\} classifier with \{LBPxVAR\} and local intensity histograms and obtained separate performance values for \{BN\} and PCa: \{JBN\} = 35.2 ± 24.9, \{OBN\} = 49.6 ± 32, \{JPCa\} = 49.5 ± 18.5, \{OPCa\} = 72.7 ± 14.8 and Ri = 60.6 ± 7.6 in the test set. Our pixel-based classification does not rely on the detection of lumens, which is prone to errors and has limitations in high-grade cancers and has the potential to aid in clinical studies in which the quantification of tumor content is necessary to prognosticate the course of the disease. The image data set with ground truth annotation is available for public use to stimulate further research in this area. "}

While digital pathology has substantial implications for telepathology, second opinions, and education there are also huge research opportunities in image computing with this new source of “big data”. It is well known that there is fundamental prognostic data embedded in pathology images. The ability to mine “sub-visual” image features from digital pathology slide images, features that may not be visually discernible by a pathologist, offers the opportunity for better quantitative modeling of disease appearance and hence possibly improved prediction of disease aggressiveness and patient outcome. However the compelling opportunities in precision medicine offered by big digital pathology data come with their own set of computational challenges. Image analysis and computer assisted detection and diagnosis tools previously developed in the context of radiographic images are woefully inadequate to deal with the data density in high resolution digitized whole slide images. Additionally there has been recent substantial interest in combining and fusing radiologic imaging and proteomics and genomics based measurements with features extracted from digital pathology images for better prognostic prediction of disease aggressiveness and patient outcome. Again there is a paucity of powerful tools for combining disease specific features that manifest across multiple different length scales. The purpose of this review is to discuss developments in computational image analysis tools for predictive modeling of digital pathology images from a detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and tissue classification perspective. We discuss the emergence of new handcrafted feature approaches for improved predictive modeling of tissue appearance and also review the emergence of deep learning schemes for both object detection and tissue classification. We also briefly review some of the state of the art in fusion of radiology and pathology images and also combining digital pathology derived image measurements with molecular “omics” features for better predictive modeling. The review ends with a brief discussion of some of the technical and computational challenges to be overcome and reflects on future opportunities for the quantitation of histopathology. "}

In this paper, a technique based on the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) is presented for intrusion detection. The proposed technique uses alpha profiling to reduce the time complexity while irrelevant features are discarded using an ensemble of Filtered, Correlation and Consistency based feature selection techniques. Instead of sampling, beta profiling is used to reduce the size of the training dataset. For performance evaluation of proposed technique the standard NSL-KDD 2009 (Network Security Laboratory-Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) dataset is used. In this paper time and space complexity of the proposed technique is also discussed. The experimental results yielded an accuracy of 98.66% with a false positive rate of 1.74% and a detection time of 2.43 s for binary class NSL-KDD dataset. The proposed \{IDS\} achieve 97.67% of accuracy with 1.74% of false positive rate in 2.65 s of detection time for multi-class NSL-KDD dataset. The Kyoto University benchmark dataset is also used to test the proposed IDS. Accuracy of 96.37% with false positive rate of 5.76% is yielded by the proposed technique. The proposed technique outperforms other published techniques in terms of accuracy, false positive rate and detection time. Based on the experimental results achieved, we conclude that the proposed technique is an efficient method for network intrusion detection. "}

Recent studies in IV-OCT have demonstrated the importance of the bifurcation regions. Therefore, the development of an automated tool to classify hundreds of coronary \{OCT\} frames as bifurcation or nonbifurcation can be an important step to improve automated methods for atherosclerotic plaques quantification, stent analysis and co-registration between different modalities. This paper describes a fully automated method to identify IV-OCT frames in bifurcation regions. The method is divided into lumen detection; feature extraction; and classification, providing a lumen area quantification, geometrical features of the cross-sectional lumen and labeled slices. This classification method is a combination of supervised machine learning algorithms and feature selection using orthogonal least squares methods. Training and tests were performed in sets with a maximum of 1460 human coronary \{OCT\} frames. The lumen segmentation achieved a mean difference of lumen area of 0.11 mm2 compared with manual segmentation, and the AdaBoost classifier presented the best result reaching a F-measure score of 97.5% using 104 features.

However, the number of labeled data is always limited due to the high cost of data acquisition. Nowadays, crowd sourcing becomes an effective approach to gather large number of data; meanwhile, most of them are unlabeled. Therefore, it is worth studying the use of unlabeled data to improve localization performance. To achieve this goal, a novel algorithm Semi-supervised Deep Extreme Learning Machine (SDELM) is proposed, which takes the advantages of semi-supervised learning, Deep Leaning (DL), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), so that the localization performance can be improved both in the feature extraction procedure and in the classifier. The experimental results in real indoor environments show that the proposed \{SDELM\} not only outperforms other compared methods but also reduces the calibration effort with the help of unlabeled data.

This is done by extracting \{BGP\} over several color channels and embedding an additional compact color layout descriptor. Then we propose an effective method for the aggregation of multiple \{ELMs\} into a single classification system, which leads to significant classification accuracy improvements. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that multi-channel color information constantly improves classification results. The integration of multiple \{ELMs\} into an ensemble using the proposed aggregation strategy significantly outperforms linear \{SVM\} in terms of accuracy, and reaches results similar to the non-linear \{SVM\} while operating in real time. Therefore, an ensemble of \{ELMs\} with the proposed aggregation strategy could be used as an efficient alternative to the non-linear \{SVM\} for remote sensing image classification tasks. "}

In order to observe this phenomenon in practice, labor and delivery are routinely monitored using cardiotocography monitors. The cardiotocography recordings are used by obstetricians to help diagnosis fetus hypoxia. However, cardiotocography capture and interpretation is time consuming and subjective, often leading to misclassification that result in damage to the fetus and unnecessary cesarean sections. Therefore, correct classification is dependent on qualified and experienced obstetric and midwifery staff and their understanding of classification methods. As such, other, more objective measures may help to reduce misclassification among medical practitioners. For example, automatic detection of correlates between uterine contractions and fetal heart rate can be used to reduce unnecessary medical interventions, such as hypoxia and cesarean section, during the first stage of labor and can be instrumental in vaginal delivery in the second. The challenge is to develop predictive algorithms capable of detecting, with high accuracy, when a child is genuinely compromised before medical intervention is considered. This chapter aims to provide a discussion of the requirements for such an approach and discuss a methodology for objectively identifying intrapartum hypoxia. "}

Kilimanjaro, the skill of 14 machine learning algorithms in predicting spatial temperature patterns is tested and evaluated against the heavily utilized kriging approach. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation testing design, regression trees generally perform better than linear and non-linear regression models. The best individual performance has been observed by the stochastic gradient boosting model followed by Cubist, random forest and model averaged neural networks which except for the latter are all regression tree-based algorithms. While these machine learning algorithms perform better than kriging in a quantitative evaluation, the overall visual interpretation of the resulting air temperature maps is ambiguous. Here, a combined Cubist and residual kriging approach can be considered the best solution. "}

Erroneous requirements, if not detected early, may cause many serious problems, such as substantial additional costs, failure to meet the expected objectives and delays in delivery dates. For these reasons, great effort must be devoted in requirements engineering to ensure that the project’s requirements results are of high quality. One of the aims of this discipline is the automatic processing of requirements for assessing their quality; this aim, however, results in a complex task because the quality of requirements depends mostly on the interpretation of experts and the necessities and demands of the project at hand. Objective The objective of this paper is to assess the quality of requirements automatically, emulating the assessment that a quality expert of a project would assess. Method The proposed methodology is based on the idea of learning based on standard metrics that represent the characteristics that an expert takes into consideration when deciding on the good or bad quality of requirements. Using machine learning techniques, a classifier is trained with requirements earlier classified by the expert, which then is used for classifying newly provided requirements. Results We present two approaches to represent the methodology with two situations of the problem in function of the requirement corpus learning balancing, obtaining different results in the accuracy and the efficiency in order to evaluate both representations. The paper demonstrates the reliability of the methodology by presenting a case study with requirements provided by the Requirements Working Group of the \{INCOSE\} organization. Conclusions A methodology that evaluates the quality of requirements written in natural language is presented in order to emulate the quality that the expert would provide for new requirements, with 86.1 of average in the accuracy.

Using a large cohort of epilepsy patients with and without mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), we sought to automatically classify \{MTS\} using measures of cortical morphology, and to further relate classification probabilities to measures of disease burden. Materials and methods Our sample consisted of high-resolution \{T1\} structural scans of 169 adults with epilepsy collected across five different 1.5 T and four different 3 T scanners at UCLA. We applied a multiple support vector machine recursive feature elimination algorithm to morphological measures generated from FreeSurfer's automated segmentation and parcellation in order to classify Epilepsy patients with \{MTS\} (n = 85) from those without \{MTS\} (N = 84). Results In addition to hippocampal volume, we found that alterations in cortical thickness, surface area, volume and curvature in inferior frontal and anterior and inferior temporal regions contributed to a classification accuracy of up to 81% (p = 1.3 × 10−17) in identifying MTS. We also found that \{MTS\} classification probabilities were associated with a longer duration of disease for epilepsy patients both with and without MTS. Conclusions In addition to implicating extra-hippocampal involvement of MTS, these findings shed further light on the pathogenesis of \{TLE\} and may ultimately assist in the development of automated tools that incorporate multiple neuroimaging measures to assist clinicians in detecting more subtle cases of \{TLE\} and MTS.

To provide a handle to the problem, the overexpression level was categorized as low, medium and high. A set of features which were likely to affect the overexpression level was generated based on the known facts (e.g. gene length) and knowledge gathered from related literature. Then, a representative sub-set of features generated in the previous objective was determined using feature selection techniques. Finally a predictive model was developed using random forest classifier which was able to adequately classify the multi-class imbalanced small dataset constructed.

The effectiveness of the proposed \{KELM\} method is evaluated against the grid search based support vector regression (SVR), as a robust methodology. Three \{KELM\} and \{SVR\} models are developed using different input attributes including: (1) Tmin and Tmax, (2) Tmin and Tmax−Tmin, and (3) Tmax and Tmax−Tmin. The achieved results reveal that the best predictions precision is achieved by models (3). The achieved results demonstrate that \{KELM\} offers favorable predictions and outperforms the SVR.

The model is based on a large volume of historical patient data and serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate the distributed learning approach. Patients and methods Clinical data from 698 lung cancer patients, treated with curative intent with chemoradiation (CRT) or radiotherapy (RT) alone were collected and stored in 2 different cancer institutes (559 patients at Institute 1 (Country 1)), 139 at University of Institute 2 (Country 2). The model was further validated on 196 patients originating from the Institute 3 (Institute 3, Country 3). A Bayesian network model was adapted for distributed learning (watch the animation: link censored). Two-year post-treatment survival was chosen as endpoint. The Institute 1 cohort data is publicly available at (link censored) and the developed models can be found at (link censored). Results Variables included in the final model were T and N stage, age, performance status, and total tumor dose. The model has an \{AUC\} of 0.66 on the external validation set and an \{AUC\} of 0.62 on a 5-fold cross-validation. A model based on T and N stage performed with an \{AUC\} of 0.47 on the validation set, significantly worse than our model (P&lt;0.001). Learning the model in a centralized or distributed fashion yields a minor difference on the probabilities of the conditional probability tables (0.6%), discriminative performance of the models on the validation set is similar (P=0.26). Conclusion Distributed learning from federated databases allows learning of predictive models on data originating from multiple institutions while avoiding many of the data sharing barriers.

abstract = {"Abstract In insulin and leptin signaling pathway, Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) plays a crucial controlling role as a negative regulator, which makes it an attractive therapeutic target for both Type-2 Diabetes (T2D) and obesity. In this work, we have generated classification models by using the inhibition data set of known \{PTP1B\} inhibitors to identify new inhibitors of \{PTP1B\} utilizing multiple machine learning techniques like naïve Bayesian, random forest, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors, along with structural fingerprints and selected molecular descriptors. Several models from each algorithm have been constructed and optimized, with the different combination of molecular descriptors and structural fingerprints. For the training and test sets, most of the predictive models showed more than 90% of overall prediction accuracies. The best model was obtained with support vector machine approach and has Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.82 for the external test set, which was further employed for the virtual screening of Maybridge small compound database. Five compounds were subsequently selected for experimental assay. Out of these two compounds were found to inhibit \{PTP1B\} with significant inhibitory activity in in-vitro inhibition assay. The structural fragments which are important for \{PTP1B\} inhibition were identified by naïve Bayesian method and can be further exploited to design new molecules around the identified scaffolds. The descriptive and predictive modeling strategy applied in this study is capable of identifying \{PTP1B\} inhibitors from the large compound libraries. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an effective learning algorithm for single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNNs). Due to its easiness in theory and implementation, \{ELM\} has been widely used in many fields. In order to further enhance the generalization performance of ELM, a positive and negative correlation input attributes oriented subnets based double parallel extreme learning machine (PCNCIAOS-DPELM) is proposed in this paper. A salient feature in the PNIAOS-DPELM is that there are two special subnets. In one of the two subnets, the input attributes have a positive correlation to the outputs. In another subnet, the input attributes have a negative correlation to the outputs. The two kinds of input attributes can be obtained by separating the input attributes into two categories using the correlation coefficient analysis. Then according to the categories, the two subnets can be established. The two subnets are based on well-trained auto-associative neural networks (AANNs), which can extract the nonlinear information of the input attributes and remove the redundant information. An advantage in PNIAOS-DPELM is that the proper number of the nodes in the hidden layer can be determined. To test the validity of PNIAOS-DPELM, it is applied to monitoring three chemical processes in steady state. Meanwhile, ELM, double parallel \{ELM\} (DP-ELM), and \{ELM\} with kernel (ELMK) were developed for comparisons. Experimental results demonstrated that PNIAOS-DPELM could achieve better regression precision and have better stable ability than ELM, DP-ELM, and \{ELMK\} did during the generalization phase. "}

In comparison with CP-ELM, DP-ELM owns the advantage in the number of hidden nodes, but it loses the edge with respect to the training time. Hence, in this paper an equivalent measure is proposed to accelerate DP-ELM (ADP-ELM). As a result, ADP-ELM not only keeps the same hidden nodes as DP-ELM but also needs less training time than CP-ELM, which is especially important for the training time sensitive scenarios. The similar idea is extended to regularized \{ELM\} (RELM), yielding ADP-RELM. ADP-RELM accelerates the training process of DP-RELM further, and it works better than CP-RELM in terms of the number of hidden nodes and the training time. In addition, the computational complexity of the proposed accelerating scheme is analyzed in theory. From reported results on ten benchmark data sets, the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed accelerating scheme in this paper is confirmed experimentally. "}

This paper explores a particular \{PLP\} configuration which considers a nonlinear layer in parallel with a linear layer. For n inputs and m nonlinear neurons, it provides ( n + 1 ) m linear parameters, while the \{SLFN\} would have only m linear parameters (one for each hidden neuron). Since the \{ELM\} is based on adjusting only the linear parameters using the least squares estimate (LSE), the \{PLP\} network provides more freedom for the proper adjustment. Results from 12 regression and 6 classification problems are presented considering the training and test errors, the linear vector norm and the system condition number. They point out that the PLP-ELM framework is more efficient than the SLFN-ELM approach. "}

However, most of the existing studies have a shortage of real data for analysis and focus on a very limited version of the problem by covering only a specific actor, healthcare service, or disease. The purpose of this study is to implement and evaluate a novel framework to detect fraudulent and abusive cases independently from the actors and commodities involved in the claims and an extensible structure to introduce new fraud and abuse types. Interactive machine learning that allows incorporating expert knowledge in an unsupervised setting is utilized to detect fraud and abusive cases in healthcare. In order to increase the accuracy of the framework, several well-known methods are utilized, such as the pairwise comparison method of analytic hierarchical processing (AHP) for weighting the actors and attributes, expectation maximization (EM) for clustering similar actors, two-stage data warehousing for proactive risk calculations, visualization tools for effective analyzing, and z-score and standardization in order to calculate the risks. The experts are involved in all phases of the study and produce six different abnormal behavior types using storyboards. The proposed framework is evaluated with real-life data for six different abnormal behavior types for prescriptions by covering all relevant actors and commodities. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) values are presented for each experiment. Moreover, a cost-saving model is also presented. The developed framework, i.e., the eFAD suite, is actor- and commodity-independent, configurable (i.e., easily adaptable in the dynamic environment of fraud and abusive behaviors), and effectively handles the fragmented nature of abnormal behaviors. The proposed framework combines both proactive and retrospective analysis with an enhanced visualization tool that significantly reduces the time requirements for the fact-finding process after the eFAD detects risky claims. This system is utilized by a company to produce monthly reports that include abnormal behaviors to be evaluated by the insurance company. "}

Sustainable computing studies the process by which computer engineer/scientist designs computers and associated subsystems efficiently and effectively with minimal impact on the environment.

For instance, most machine-learning-based nonparametric models are known to require high computational cost in order to find the global optima. With the learning task in a large dataset, the number of hidden nodes within the network will therefore increase significantly, which eventually leads to an exponential rise in computational complexity. This paper thus reviews the theoretical and experimental data-modeling literature, in large-scale data-intensive fields, relating to: (1) model efficiency, including computational requirements in learning, and data-intensive areas' structure and design, and introduces (2) new algorithmic approaches with the least memory requirements and processing to minimize computational cost, while maintaining/improving its predictive/classification accuracy and stability.

Another feature is that PCCIS-DPELM has a double parallel structure. The PCCIS-DPELM model can well deal with the highly nonlinear data generating from complex chemical processes. In order to test the performance of PCCIS-DPELM, two complex processes of the Tennessee Eastman (TE) and the purified terephthalic acid (PTA) were selected. Then PCCIS-DPELM based soft sensors were developed for modeling the two complex processes. Compared with double parallel \{ELM\} (DPELM) and ELM, the experimental results of the two applications demonstrate that the PCCIS-DPELM model with less number of parameters can achieve smaller predicted relative errors. And the PCCIS-DPELM model can respond faster than the other two models. It is proved that the proposed PCCIS-DPELM is a promising method for accurately modeling complex chemical processes. "}

Specifically, the brain connectome is reconstructed using white matter fiber tracts from presurgical diffusion tensor imaging. To achieve our objective, a two-stage connectome-based prediction framework is developed that gradually selects a small number of abnormal network connections that contribute to the surgical treatment outcome, and in each stage a linear kernel operation is used to further improve the accuracy of the learned classifier. Using a 10-fold cross validation strategy, the first stage in the connectome-based framework is able to separate patients with \{TLE\} from normal controls with 80% accuracy, and second stage in the connectome-based framework is able to correctly predict the surgical treatment outcome of patients with \{TLE\} with 70% accuracy. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods that use \{VBM\} data, the proposed two-stage connectome-based prediction framework is a suitable alternative with comparable prediction performance. Our results additionally show that machine learning algorithms that exclusively use structural connectome data can predict treatment outcomes in epilepsy with similar accuracy compared with “expert-based” clinical decision. In summary, using the unprecedented information provided in the brain connectome, machine learning algorithms may uncover pathological changes in brain network organization and improve outcome forecasting in the context of epilepsy.

For muscle invasive bladder cancer, surgical removal of the bladder, i.e. radical cystectomy, is in general the definitive treatment which, unfortunately, carries significant morbidities and mortalities. Accurate prediction of the mortality of radical cystectomy is therefore needed. Statistical methods have conventionally been used for this purpose, despite the complex interactions of high-dimensional medical data. Machine learning has emerged as a promising technique for handling high-dimensional data, with increasing application in clinical decision support, e.g. cancer prediction and prognosis. Its ability to reveal the hidden nonlinear interactions and interpretable rules between dependent and independent variables is favorable for constructing models of effective generalization performance. In this paper, seven machine learning methods are utilized to predict the 5-year mortality of radical cystectomy, including back-propagation neural network (BPN), radial basis function (RBFN), extreme learning machine (ELM), regularized \{ELM\} (RELM), support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB) classifier and k-nearest neighbour (KNN), on a clinicopathological dataset of 117 patients of the urology unit of a hospital in Hong Kong. The experimental results indicate that \{RELM\} achieved the highest average prediction accuracy of 0.8 at a fast learning speed. The research findings demonstrate the potential of applying machine learning techniques to support clinical decision making. "}

This extension enables fully causal combustion timing predictions at randomly chosen engine set points, and is shown to achieve results that are as good as or better than the previous offline method.

abstract = {"AbstractIntroduction Predicting mortality from burn injury has traditionally employed logistic regression models. Alternative machine learning methods have been introduced in some areas of clinical prediction as the necessary software and computational facilities have become accessible. Here we compare logistic regression and machine learning predictions of mortality from burn. Methods An established logistic mortality model was compared to machine learning methods (artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forests and naïve Bayes) using a population-based (England &amp; Wales) case-cohort registry. Predictive evaluation used: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; sensitivity; specificity; positive predictive value and Youden's index. Results All methods had comparable discriminatory abilities, similar sensitivities, specificities and positive predictive values. Although some machine learning methods performed marginally better than logistic regression the differences were seldom statistically significant and clinically insubstantial. Random forests were marginally better for high positive predictive value and reasonable sensitivity. Neural networks yielded slightly better prediction overall. Logistic regression gives an optimal mix of performance and interpretability. Discussion The established logistic regression model of burn mortality performs well against more complex alternatives. Clinical prediction with a small set of strong, stable, independent predictors is unlikely to gain much from machine learning outside specialist research contexts. "}

abstract = {"Summary Selecting an adequate set of inputs is a critical step for successful data-driven streamflow prediction. In this study, we present a novel approach for Input Variable Selection (IVS) that employs Binary-coded discrete Fully Informed Particle Swarm optimization (BFIPS) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to develop fast and accurate \{IVS\} algorithms. A scheme is employed to encode the subset of selected inputs and \{ELM\} specifications into the binary particles, which are evolved using single objective and multi-objective \{BFIPS\} optimization (MBFIPS). The performances of these ELM-based methods are assessed using the evaluation criteria and the datasets included in the comprehensive \{IVS\} evaluation framework proposed by Galelli et al. (2014). From a comparison with 4 major \{IVS\} techniques used in their original study it emerges that the proposed methods compare very well in terms of selection accuracy. The best performers were found to be (1) a MBFIPS–ELM algorithm based on the concurrent minimization of an error function and the number of selected inputs, and (2) a BFIPS–ELM algorithm based on the minimization of a variant of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The first technique is arguably the most accurate overall, and is able to reach an almost perfect specification of the optimal input subset for a partially synthetic rainfall–runoff experiment devised for the Kentucky River basin. In addition, MBFIPS–ELM allows for the determination of the relative importance of the selected inputs. On the other hand, the BFIPS–ELM is found to consistently reach high accuracy scores while being considerably faster. By extrapolating the results obtained on the \{IVS\} test-bed, it can be concluded that the proposed techniques are particularly suited for rainfall–runoff modeling applications characterized by high nonlinearity in the catchment dynamics.

A partially submerged steeply inclined thin plate (ITP) is also one of the candidate alternative structures. Knowledge about the wave attenuation mechanism of \{ITP\} improves the engineer's ability to make more cost-effective design. From this motivation, the mechanism of \{ITP\} was modeled by artificial neural networks based on experimental data. It is particularly aimed to reveal some fundamental facts about the attenuation mechanism of ITP, which could not be previously attained solely by the conventional analysis of the relevant experimental data. Surface plots, which depict the relationships between the governing design variables were generated from the developed model. In this way, the influence of each individual parameter on the performance was decomposed in a more precise way. Based on the data-driven model outputs, it was inferred that the most dominant design variable is the wavelength. The \{ITP\} performance is enhanced with increasing submergence degree, an effect that becomes even more pronounced in severe wave climate conditions. In such wave conditions, decreasing inclination angles also improve the functionality of the structure. However, the generated data-driven model indicated that the combination of the examined variables can have a more complicated effect on the \{ITP\} performance, especially for the longer wave lengths.

Early post-deployment identification can direct early interventions to those in need and thereby prevents the development of chronic psychopathology. Both hold significant public health benefits given large numbers of deployed soldiers, but has so far not been achieved. Here, we aim to assess the potential for pre- and early post-deployment prediction of resilience or posttraumatic stress development in soldiers by application of machine learning (ML) methods. Methods \{ML\} feature selection and prediction algorithms were applied to a prospective cohort of 561 Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 to identify unique risk indicators and forecast long-term posttraumatic stress responses. Results Robust pre- and early postdeployment risk indicators were identified, and included individual \{PTSD\} symptoms as well as total level of \{PTSD\} symptoms, previous trauma and treatment, negative emotions, and thought suppression. The predictive performance of these risk indicators combined was assessed by cross-validation. Together, these indicators forecasted long term posttraumatic stress responses with high accuracy (pre-deployment: AUC=0.84 (95% CI=0.81–0.87), post-deployment: AUC=0.88 (95% CI=0.85–0.91)). Limitations This study utilized a previously collected data set and was therefore not designed to exhaust the potential of \{ML\} methods. Further, the study relied solely on self-reported measures. Conclusions Pre-deployment and early post-deployment identification of risk for long-term posttraumatic psychopathology are feasible and could greatly reduce the public health costs of war. "}

Due to the complex and dynamic nature of many construction and infrastructure projects, the ability to detect and classify key activities performed in the field by various equipment and human crew can improve the quality and reliability of project decision-making and control. In particular to simulation modeling, process-level knowledge obtained as a result of activity recognition can help verify and update the input parameters of simulation models. Such input parameters include but are not limited to activity durations and precedence, resource flows, and site layout. The goal of this research is to investigate the prospect of using built-in smartphone sensors as ubiquitous multi-modal data collection and transmission nodes in order to detect detailed construction equipment activities which can ultimately contribute to the process of simulation input modeling. A case study of front-end loader activity recognition is presented to describe the methodology for action recognition and evaluate the performance of the developed system. In the designed methodology, certain key features are extracted from the collected data using accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, and a subset of the extracted features is used to train supervised machine learning classifiers. In doing so, several important technical details such as selection of discriminating features to extract, sensitivity analysis of data segmentation window size, and choice of the classifier to be trained are investigated. It is shown that the choice of the level of detail (LoD) in describing equipment actions (classes) is an important factor with major impact on the classification performance. Results also indicate that although decreasing the number of classes generally improves the classification output, considering other factors such as actions to be combined as a single activity, methodologies to extract knowledge from classified activities, computational efficiency, and end use of the classification process may as well influence one’s decision in selecting an optimal LoD in describing equipment activities (classes).

abstract = {"AbstractBackground and objective Understanding the causes of disagreement among experts in clinical decision making has been a challenge for decades. In particular, a high amount of variability exists in diagnosis of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), which is a disease affecting low birth weight infants and a major cause of childhood blindness. A possible cause of variability, that has been mostly neglected in the literature, is related to discrepancies in the sets of important features considered by different experts. In this paper we propose a methodology which makes use of machine learning techniques to understand the underlying causes of inter-expert variability. Methods The experiments are carried out on a dataset consisting of 34 retinal images, each with diagnoses provided by 22 independent experts. Feature selection techniques are applied to discover the most important features considered by a given expert. Those features selected by each expert are then compared to the features selected by other experts by applying similarity measures. Finally, an automated diagnosis system is built in order to check if this approach can be helpful in solving the problem of understanding high inter-rater variability. Results The experimental results reveal that some features are mostly selected by the feature selection methods regardless the considered expert. Moreover, for pairs of experts with high percentage agreement among them, the feature selection algorithms also select similar features. By using the relevant selected features, the classification performance of the automatic system was improved or maintained. Conclusions The proposed methodology provides a handy framework to identify important features for experts and check whether the selected features reflect the pairwise agreements/disagreements. These findings may lead to improved diagnostic accuracy and standardization among clinicians, and pave the way for the application of this methodology to other problems which present inter-expert variability.

abstract = {"Abstract In this paper, a robust hybrid model integrating an enhanced inputs based extreme learning machine with the partial least square regression (PLSR-EIELM) was proposed. The proposed PLSR-EIELM model can overcome two main flaws in the extreme learning machine (ELM), i.e. the intractable problem in determining the optimal number of the hidden layer neurons and the over-fitting phenomenon. First, a traditional extreme learning machine (ELM) is selected. Second, a method of randomly assigning is applied to the weights between the input layer and the hidden layer, and then the nonlinear transformation for independent variables can be obtained from the output of the hidden layer neurons. Especially, the original input variables are regarded as enhanced inputs; then the enhanced inputs and the nonlinear transformed variables are tied together as the whole independent variables. In this way, the \{PLSR\} can be carried out to identify the \{PLS\} components not only from the nonlinear transformed variables but also from the original input variables, which can remove the correlation among the whole independent variables and the expected outputs. Finally, the optimal relationship model of the whole independent variables with the expected outputs can be achieved by using PLSR. Thus, the PLSR-EIELM model is developed. Then the PLSR-EIELM model served as an intelligent measurement tool for the key variables of the Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) process and the High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) process. The experimental results show that the predictive accuracy of PLSR-EIELM is stable, which indicate that PLSR-EIELM has good robust character. Moreover, compared with ELM, PLSR, hierarchical \{ELM\} (HELM), and PLSR-ELM, PLSR-EIELM can achieve much smaller predicted relative errors in these two applications. "}

Traditionally, petroleum and natural gas engineers rely on “rules-of-thumb” in the selection of optimal features with much disregard to the hidden patterns in operational data. The traditional multivariate method of feature selection has become grossly inadequate as it is incapable of handling the non-linearity embedded in such natural phenomena. With the application of computational intelligence and its hybrid techniques in the petroleum industry, much improvement has been made. However, they are still incapable of handling more than one hypothesis at a time. Ensemble learning offers robust methodologies to handle the uncertainties in most complex industrial problems. This learning paradigm has not been well embraced in petroleum reservoir characterization despite the persistent quest for increased prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a novel ensemble model of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in the prediction of reservoir properties while utilizing the non-linear approximation capability of Functional Networks to select the optimal input features. Different instances of \{ELM\} were fed with features selected from different bootstrap samplings of the real-life field datasets. When benchmarked against existing techniques, our proposed ensemble model outperformed the multivariate regression-based feature selection, the conventional bagging and the Random Forest methods with higher correlation coefficient and lower prediction errors. This work confirms the huge potential in the capability of the new ensemble modeling paradigm to improve the prediction of reservoir properties. "}

For many neurological diseases, adherence to medication regimens can be assessed by observing movement patterns. However, physician observations are typically assessed based on visual inspection of movement and are limited to clinical testing procedures. Consequently, medication adherence is difficult to measure when patients are away from the clinical setting. The authors propose a data mining driven methodology that uses low cost, non-wearable multimodal sensors to model and predict patients' adherence to medication protocols, based on variations in their gait. The authors conduct a study involving Parkinson's disease patients that are “on” and “off” their medication in order to determine the statistical validity of the methodology. The data acquired can then be used to quantify patients' adherence while away from the clinic. Accordingly, this data-driven system may allow for early warnings regarding patient safety. Using whole-body movement data readings from the patients, the authors were able to discriminate between \{PD\} patients on and off medication, with accuracies greater than 97% for some patients using an individually customized model and accuracies of 78% for a generalized model containing multiple patient gait data. The proposed methodology and study demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of using low cost, non-wearable hardware and data mining models to monitor medication adherence outside of the traditional healthcare facility. These innovations may allow for cost effective, remote monitoring of treatment of neurological diseases. "}

The novelty of our approach for its potential application to problems in coastal engineering is twofold. On one hand, we propose a genetic algorithm hybridized with an extreme learning machine that selects, among the available wave parameters from the nearby buoys, a subset F n S P with nSP parameters that minimizes the Hs reconstruction error. On the other hand, we evaluate to what extent the selected parameters in subset F n S P are good enough in assisting other machine learning (ML) regressors (extreme learning machines, support vector machines and gaussian process regression) to reconstruct Hs. The results show that all the \{ML\} method explored achieve a good Hs reconstruction in the two different locations studied (Caribbean Sea and West Atlantic). "}

Indeed we propose to decompose the error considering four kinds of uncertainties: the error due to the measurement, the variability of time series, the machine learning uncertainty and the error related to the horizon. All these components of the error allow to determinate a global uncertainty generating prediction bands related to the prediction efficiency. We also have defined a reliability index which could be very interesting for the grid manager in order to estimate the validity of predictions. We have experimented this method on a multilayer perceptron which is a popular machine learning technique. We have shown that the global error and its components are essential to quantify in order to estimate the reliability of the model outputs. The described method has been successfully applied to four meteorological stations in Mediterranean area. "}

The design challenge for such an imaging-based micro-flow cytometer under poor resolution is how to recover cell recognition error under various flow rates. A microfluidic lensless imaging system is developed in this paper using extreme-learning-machine enhanced single-frame super-resolution processing, which can effectively recover the recognition error when increasing flow rate for throughput. As shown in the experiments, with mixed flowing HepG2 and Huh7 cells as inputs, the developed scheme shows that 23% better recognition accuracy can be achieved compared to the one without error recovery. Meanwhile, it also achieves an average of 98.5% resource saving compared to the previous multi-frame super-resolution processing. "}

Difficulties in fear inhibition during safety signal processing have been reported as a pathophysiological feature of \{PD\} that is attenuated by depression. We investigated the impact of comorbid depression in \{PD\} with agoraphobia (AG) on the neural correlates of fear conditioning and the potential of machine learning to predict comorbidity status on the individual patient level based on neural characteristics. Methods Fifty-nine PD/AG patients including 26 (44%) with a comorbid depressive disorder (PD/AG+DEP) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Comorbidity status was predicted using a random undersampling tree ensemble in a leave-one-out cross-validation framework. Results PD/AG−DEP patients showed altered neural activation during safety signal processing, while +DEP patients exhibited generally decreased dorsolateral prefrontal and insular activation. Comorbidity status was correctly predicted in 79% of patients (sensitivity: 73%; specificity: 85%) based on brain activation during fear conditioning (corrected for potential confounders: accuracy: 73%; sensitivity: 77%; specificity: 70%). Limitations No primary depressed patients were available; only medication-free patients were included. Major depression and dysthymia were collapsed (power considerations). Conclusions Neurofunctional activation during safety signal processing differed between patients with or without comorbid depression, a finding which may explain heterogeneous results across previous studies. These findings demonstrate the relevance of comorbidity when investigating neurofunctional substrates of anxiety disorders. Predicting individual comorbidity status may translate neurofunctional data into clinically relevant information which might aid in planning individualized treatment.

This involves studying three related aspects: structural identifiability (SI), parameter redundancy (PR) and reparameterization. Firstly, by employing the Rank Theorem in Riemann geometry, we derive an efficient identifiability criterion by calculating the rank of the derivative matrix (DM) of IF. Secondly, we extend the previous concept of \{IF\} to local \{IF\} (LIF) for examining local parameter structure of SLMs, and prove that the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) is such a proper LIF, thus relating the \{LIF\} approach to several existing criteria. Lastly, an analytical approach for solving minimal reparameterization in parameter-redundant models is established. The dimensionality of the minimal reparameterization can be used to characterize the intrinsic parameter dimensionality of model. We compare the \{IF\} approach with existing criteria and discuss its pros/cons from theoretical and application viewpoints. Several model examples from the literature are presented to study their parameter structure. "}

Typically the goal of these studies is to develop methods to predict, at any one moment of time, the activity or activities that the resident(s) of the home are engaged in, which may in turn be used for determining normal or abnormal patterns of behaviour (e.g. in a health-care setting). Classification algorithms, such as Conditional Random Field (CRFs), typically consider sensor activations as features but these are often treated as if they were independent, which in general they are not. Our hypothesis is that learning patterns based on combinations of sensors will be more powerful than single sensors alone. The exhaustive approach – to take all possible combinations of sensors and learn classifier weights for each combination – is clearly computationally prohibitive. We show that through the application of signal processing and information-theoretic techniques we can learn about the sensor topology in the home (i.e. learn an adjacency matrix) which enables us to determine the combinations of sensors that will be useful for classification ahead of time. As a result we can achieve classification performance better than that of the exhaustive approach, whilst only incurring a small cost in terms of computational resources. We demonstrate our results on several datasets, showing that our method is robust in terms of variations in the layout and the number of residents in the house. Furthermore, we have incorporated the adjacency matrix into the \{CRF\} learning framework and have shown that it can improve performance over multiple baselines. "}

Machine learning (ML) algorithms can ‘learn’ from data: for instance a \{ML\} system can be trained on a set of features derived from written texts belonging to known categories, and learn to distinguish between them. Such a trained system can then be used to classify unseen texts. In this paper, we explore the potential of the technique to classify transcribed speech samples along clinical dimensions, using vocabulary data alone. We report the accuracy with which two related \{ML\} algorithms [naive Bayes Gaussian (NBG) and naive Bayes multinomial (NBM)] categorized picture descriptions produced by: 32 semantic dementia (SD) patients versus 10 healthy, age-matched controls; and \{SD\} patients with left- (n = 21) versus right-predominant (n = 11) patterns of temporal lobe atrophy. We used information gain (IG) to identify the vocabulary features that were most informative to each of these two distinctions. In the \{SD\} versus control classification task, both algorithms achieved accuracies of greater than 90%. In the right- versus left-temporal lobe predominant classification, \{NBM\} achieved a high level of accuracy (88%), but this was achieved by both \{NBM\} and \{NBG\} when the features used in the training set were restricted to those with high values of IG. The most informative features for the patient versus control task were low frequency content words, generic terms and components of metanarrative statements. For the right versus left task the number of informative lexical features was too small to support any specific inferences. An enriched feature set, including values derived from Quantitative Production Analysis (QPA) may shed further light on this little understood distinction. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Statistical and now machine learning prediction methods have been gaining popularity in the field of landslide susceptibility modeling. Particularly, these data driven approaches show promise when tackling the challenge of mapping landslide prone areas for large regions, which may not have sufficient geotechnical data to conduct physically-based methods. Currently, there is no best method for empirical susceptibility modeling. Therefore, this study presents a comparison of traditional statistical and novel machine learning models applied for regional scale landslide susceptibility modeling. These methods were evaluated by spatial k-fold cross-validation estimation of the predictive performance, assessment of variable importance for gaining insights into model behavior and by the appearance of the prediction (i.e. susceptibility) map. The modeling techniques applied were logistic regression (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), weights of evidence (WOE), the support vector machine (SVM), random forest classification (RF), and bootstrap aggregated classification trees (bundling) with penalized discriminant analysis (BPLDA). These modeling methods were tested for three areas in the province of Lower Austria, Austria. The areas are characterized by different geological and morphological settings. Random forest and bundling classification techniques had the overall best predictive performances. However, the performances of all modeling techniques were for the majority not significantly different from each other; depending on the areas of interest, the overall median estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) differences ranged from 2.9 to 8.9 percentage points. The overall median estimated true positive rate (TPR) measured at a 10% false positive rate (FPR) differences ranged from 11 to 15pp. The relative importance of each predictor was generally different between the modeling methods. However, slope angle, surface roughness and plan curvature were consistently highly ranked variables. The prediction methods that create splits in the predictors (RF, \{BPLDA\} and WOE) resulted in heterogeneous prediction maps full of spatial artifacts. In contrast, the GAM, \{GLM\} and \{SVM\} produced smooth prediction surfaces. Overall, it is suggested that the framework of this model evaluation approach can be applied to assist in selection of a suitable landslide susceptibility modeling technique. "}

Different models and approaches do exist, but all require a vast amount of data on the properties of the chemical compounds being assessed, which are hard to collect or hardly publicly available (especially for thousands of less common or newly developed chemicals), therefore hampering in practice the assessment in LCA. An example is USEtox, a consensual model for the characterization of human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity. This paper places itself in a line of research aiming at providing a methodology to reduce the number of input parameters necessary to run multimedia fate models, focusing in particular to the application of the \{USEtox\} toxicity model. By focusing on USEtox, in this paper two main goals are pursued: 1) performing an extensive exploratory analysis (using dimensionality reduction techniques) of the input space constituted by the substance-specific properties at the aim of detecting particular patterns in the data manifold and estimating the dimension of the subspace in which the data manifold actually lies; and 2) exploring the application of a set of linear models, based on partial least squares (PLS) regression, as well as a nonlinear model (general regression neural network — GRNN) in the seek for an automatic selection strategy of the most informative variables according to the modelled output (USEtox factor). After extensive analysis, the intrinsic dimension of the input manifold has been identified between three and four. The variables selected as most informative may vary according to the output modelled and the model used, but for the toxicity factors modelled in this paper the input variables selected as most informative are coherent with prior expectations based on scientific knowledge of toxicity factors modelling. Thus the outcomes of the analysis are promising for the future application of the approach to other portions of the model, affected by important data gaps, e.g., to the calculation of human health effect factors.

Our principal aim was to integrate multiple data sources, train learning models for classification of archaeological soils and background soils, and compare model predictions for three validation areas with current archaeological interpretation and established predictive models. This was done using three supervised machine-learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and artificial neural networks) which were trained, cross-validated and tested. The validation areas included a high archaeological potential area (n = 247 samples), the Dutch province of Zeeland (n = 261 samples) and an excavated imprint of an ancient farmhouse (n = 38 samples). The predictive models showed good overall performance and correctly classified about 95% of all test instances. According to the learning models, the first validation site has a top soil horizon that shows limited parallels with archaeological horizons used in model training, whereas features of high archaeological probability become more apparent below this horizon. This is in good correspondence with geochemical depth profiles and current archaeological interpretation. As for the second validation site, the models highlighted several archaeological hotspots that to some extend spatially coincide with areas of high archaeological potential as indicated by established predictive modelling. Reversely, the classifiers attributed high archaeological potential status to the most southern region of Zeeland, thereby complementing established modelling results. For the third validation site none of the instances were correctly classified and these results clearly show the limitations of geochemical predictive modelling of significantly different soil types (fine-to-coarse sands) compared to the training set (clayey sands). Present proof-of-concept study shows that modelling of multiple-source geochemical soil data using machine-learning algorithms can be successfully accomplished and that model predictions nicely complement current interpretation and/or established archeological predictive modelling of areas of archaeological interest. Limitations of our approach were found to reside in lithological differences between sites used for model training and prediction sites. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Application of machine learning methods shows a popular attempt to identify the purpose of a trip and mode of travel on Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data. Data selection for the training and test sets is important in these methods. However, the feasibility and effects of choosing these data from different periods of the year are still unknown. This detail is particularly important since collecting data via \{GPS\} decreases the burden on participants to such an extent that it can last for seasons which may own distinct features. In order to bridge this gap, this paper employs Aslan &amp; Zech’s test (AZ-test) and Random Forests (RF) successively to investigate the influence of data selection from different seasons for training and test sets. The dataset obtained in a city with distinct seasons, Hakodate, Japan, is used for our empirical analysis. The results of AZ-test suggest that explanatory variables of the two data sets from distinct seasons follow different distributions. Furthermore, it concludes that data set from two-seasons and data set from single season also follow different distributions. However, this test achieves some contradictory results in some cases. Due to this, \{RF\} is used to check how the accuracy varies in a further detail. \{RF\} confirms the findings by AZ-test in most cases. In addition, \{RF\} results show that including \{GIS\} features as explanatory variables has positive effect on the identification accuracy while including weather features has negative effect on the identification accuracy.

However, there is still no method that can fully utilize the information hidden in the input data. In this article, we propose a learning-based method named BagReg for protein inference. The method firstly artificially extracts five features from the input data, and then chooses each feature as the class feature to separately build models to predict the presence probabilities of proteins. Finally, the weak results from five prediction models are aggregated to obtain the final result. We test our method on six public available data sets. The experimental results show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art protein inference algorithms. "}

Sites that pose a high risk to the general public can present expensive and long-term remediation projects. Often the most pragmatic remediation approach is through routine monitoring operating gamma-ray detectors to identify, in real-time, the signal from the most hazardous heterogeneous contamination (hot particles); thus facilitating their removal and safe disposal. However, current detection systems do not fully utilise all spectral information resulting in low detection rates and ultimately an increased risk to the human health. The aim of this study was to establish an optimised detector-algorithm combination. To achieve this, field data was collected using two handheld detectors (sodium iodide and lanthanum bromide) and a number of Monte Carlo simulated hot particles were randomly injected into the field data. This allowed for the detection rate of conventional deterministic (gross counts) and machine learning (neural networks and support vector machines) algorithms to be assessed. The results demonstrated that a Neural Network operated on a sodium iodide detector provided the best detection capability. Compared to deterministic approaches, this optimised detection system could detect a hot particle on average 10 cm deeper into the soil column or with half of the activity at the same depth. It was also found that noise presented by internal contamination restricted lanthanum bromide for this application. "}

LMD, a new self-adaptive time–frequency analysis method, was applied to decompose the nonlinear and non-stationary vibration signals into a series of product functions (PFs), from which instantaneous frequencies with physical significance can be obtained. Then, the singular value vectors, as the fault feature vectors, were acquired by applying \{SVD\} to the PFs. Last, for the purpose of lessening human intervention and shortening the fault-diagnosis time, \{ELM\} was introduced for identification and classification of bearing faults.

Frequently, such translation needs should be satisfied under very tight time constraints. Machine translation (MT) techniques can constitute a solution to this overly complex problem. However, the documents to be translated in real scenarios are often limited to a specific domain, such as a particular type of medical or legal text. This situation seriously hinders the applicability of MT, since it is usually expensive to build a reliable translation system, no matter what technology is used, due to the linguistic resources that are required to build them, such as dictionaries, translation memories or parallel texts. In order to solve this problem, we propose the application of automatic post-editing in an online learning framework. Our proposed technique allows the human expert to translate in a specific domain by using a base translation system designed to work in a general domain whose output is corrected (or adapted to the specific domain) by means of an automatic post-editing module. This automatic post-editing module learns to make its corrections from user feedback in real time by means of online learning techniques. We have validated our system using different translation technologies to implement the base translation system, as well as several texts involving different domains and languages. In most cases, our results show significant improvements in terms of \{BLEU\} (up to 16 points) with respect to the baseline systems. The proposed technique works effectively when the n-grams of the document to be translated presents a certain rate of repetition, situation which is common according to the document-internal repetition property.

abstract = {"Abstract Cancer is the second leading cause of death, next only to heart disease, in both developed as well as developing countries. A major source of difficulty in addressing cancer as a disease is its bewildering variety, in that no two manifestations of cancer are alike, even when they occur in the same site. This makes cancer an ideal candidate for “personalized medicine” (also known as “precision medicine”). At present there are some high-quality public databases consisting of both molecular measurements of tumors, as well as clinical data on the patients. By applying machine learning methods to these databases, it is possible even for non-experimenters to generate plausible hypotheses that are supported by the data, which can then be validated on one or more independent data sets. A characteristic of cancer databases is that the number of measured features is many orders of magnitude larger than the number of samples. Therefore any machine learning algorithms must also perform feature selection, that is, elicit the most relevant or most predictive features from the large number of measured features. In this paper, some algorithms for sparse regression and sparse classification are reviewed, and their applications to endometrial and ovarian cancer are discussed. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Some microstructure parameters, such as permeability, remain elusive because mathematical models that express their relationship to the \{MR\} signal accurately are intractable. Here, we propose to use computational models learned from simulations to estimate these parameters. We demonstrate the approach in an example which estimates water residence time in brain white matter. The residence time τi of water inside axons is a potentially important biomarker for white matter pathologies of the human central nervous system, as myelin damage is hypothesised to affect axonal permeability, and thus τi. We construct a computational model using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning (specifically here a random forest regressor) in order to learn a mapping between features derived from diffusion weighted \{MR\} signals and ground truth microstructure parameters, including τi. We test our numerical model using simulated and in vivo human brain data. Simulation results show that estimated parameters have strong correlations with the ground truth parameters ( R 2 = { 0.88 , 0.95 , 0.82 , 0.99 } ) for volume fraction, residence time, axon radius and diffusivity respectively), and provide a marked improvement over the most widely used Kärger model ( R 2 = { 0.75 , 0.60 , 0.11 , 0.99 } ). The trained model also estimates sensible microstructure parameters from in vivo human brain data acquired from healthy controls, matching values found in literature, and provides better reproducibility than the Kärger model on both the voxel and \{ROI\} level. Finally, we acquire data from two Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and compare to the values in healthy subjects. We find that in the splenium of corpus callosum (CC-S) the estimate of the residence time is 0.57±0.05 s for the healthy subjects, while in the \{MS\} patient with a lesion in CC-S it is 0.33±0.12 s in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and 0.19±0.11 s in the lesion. In the corticospinal tracts (CST) the estimate of the residence time is 0.52±0.09 s for the healthy subjects, while in the \{MS\} patient with a lesion in \{CST\} it is 0.56±0.05 s in the \{NAWM\} and 0.13±0.09 s in the lesion. These results agree with our expectations that the residence time in lesions would be lower than in \{NAWM\} because the loss of myelin should increase permeability. Overall, we find parameter estimates in the two \{MS\} patients consistent with expectations from the pathology of \{MS\} lesions demonstrating the clinical potential of this new technique. "}

This paper investigates the efficiency of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) algorithm at predicting Penman–Monteith (P–M) \{ET0\} for Mosul, Baghdad, and Basrah meteorological stations, located at the north, mid, and southern part of Iraq. Data of weather parameters containing maximum air temperature (Tmax), minimum air temperature (Tmin), sunshine hours (Rn), relative humidity (Rh), and wind speed (U2) for the period (2000–2013) are used as inputs to the \{ELM\} model by using four different input cases including complete and incomplete sets of meteorological data. The performance of \{ELM\} model is compared with the empirical P–M equation and with feedforward backpropagation (FFBP) model. The evaluation criteria used for comparison are the root of mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The statistical results of both models are found to be encouraging; particularly results of running the \{ELM\} model with incomplete sets of data, noticing that the sensitivity of the proposed model to missing data changes from one location to another, as well as along the year for certain study location. The Rn is found to be the most effective parameter in Mosul Station, while \{U2\} and Rh are found to act almost in parallel with Rn in Baghdad Station, and for conditions of Basrah Station; \{U2\} and Rh prove to be the dominant parameters. The minimum and maximum time intervals required for running \{ELM\} model for all stations, and in all applied conditions, are (4.64–6.19) seconds respectively, while the same order of timing required for running the \{FFBP\} model is (6.30–27.80) seconds. The maximum \{R2\} recorded for the \{ELM\} model is 0.991, while for the \{FFBP\} it is 0.985. The \{ELM\} proved to be efficient, simple in application, of high speed, and has very good generalization performance; therefore, this algorithm is highly recommended for locations similar to the geographical and meteorological conditions of Iraq that consists of both arid and semiarid regions.

Selection criteria For inclusion, articles were required to meet the following criteria: (a) used a health-related database, (b) focused on injury-related cases, \{AND\} used machine learning approaches to analyse textual data. Methods The papers identified through the search were screened resulting in 16 papers selected for review. Articles were reviewed to describe the databases and methodology used, the strength and limitations of different techniques, and quality assurance approaches used. Due to heterogeneity between studies meta-analysis was not performed. Results Occupational injuries were the focus of half of the machine learning studies and the most common methods described were Bayesian probability or Bayesian network based methods to either predict injury categories or extract common injury scenarios. Models were evaluated through either comparison with gold standard data or content expert evaluation or statistical measures of quality. Machine learning was found to provide high precision and accuracy when predicting a small number of categories, was valuable for visualisation of injury patterns and prediction of future outcomes. However, difficulties related to generalizability, source data quality, complexity of models and integration of content and technical knowledge were discussed. Conclusions The use of narrative text for injury surveillance has grown in popularity, complexity and quality over recent years. With advances in data mining techniques, increased capacity for analysis of large databases, and involvement of computer scientists in the injury prevention field, along with more comprehensive use and description of quality assurance methods in text mining approaches, it is likely that we will see a continued growth and advancement in knowledge of text mining in the injury field.

Advances in \{MRI\} have revolutionized the diagnosis of FCD, resulting in higher success rates for resective epilepsy surgery. However, many patients with histologically confirmed \{FCD\} have normal presurgical \{MRI\} studies (‘MRI-negative’), making presurgical diagnosis difficult. The purpose of this study was to test whether a novel \{MRI\} postprocessing method successfully detects histopathologically verified \{FCD\} in a sample of patients without visually appreciable lesions. We applied an automated quantitative morphometry approach which computed five surface-based \{MRI\} features and combined them in a machine learning model to classify lesional and nonlesional vertices. Accuracy was defined by classifying contiguous vertices as “lesional” when they fell within the surgical resection region. Our multivariate method correctly detected the lesion in 6 of 7 MRI-positive patients, which is comparable with the detection rates that have been reported in univariate vertex-based morphometry studies. More significantly, in patients that were MRI-negative, machine learning correctly identified 14 out of 24 \{FCD\} lesions (58%). This was achieved after separating abnormal thickness and thinness into distinct classifiers, as well as separating sulcal and gyral regions. Results demonstrate that MRI-negative images contain sufficient information to aid in the in vivo detection of visually elusive \{FCD\} lesions. "}

In fact, reliable prediction is particularly useful for operators and investors to offer a secure situation with minimal economic risks. In this paper, a new model based upon \{ELM\} (extreme learning machine) is presented to estimate the wind power density. Generally, the two-parameter Weibull function has been normally used and recognized as a reliable method in wind energy estimations for most windy regions. Thus, the required data for training and testing were extracted from two accurate Weibull methods of standard deviation and power density. The validity of the \{ELM\} model is verified by comparing its predictions with \{SVM\} (Support Vector Machine), \{ANN\} (Artificial Neural Network) and \{GP\} (Genetic Programming) techniques. The wind powers predicted by all approaches are compared with those calculated using measured data. Based upon simulation results, it is demonstrated that \{ELM\} can be utilized effectively in applications of wind power predictions.

abstract = {"Abstract The classification of imbalanced data is a major challenge for machine learning. In this paper, we presented a fuzzy total margin based support vector machine (FTM-SVM) method to handle the class imbalance learning (CIL) problem in the presence of outliers and noise. The proposed method incorporates total margin algorithm, different cost functions and the proper approach of fuzzification of the penalty into FTM-SVM and formulates them in nonlinear case. We considered an excellent type of fuzzy membership functions to assign fuzzy membership values and got six FTM-SVM settings. We evaluated the proposed FTM-SVM method on two artificial data sets and 16 real-world imbalanced data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed FTM-SVM method has higher G_Mean and F_Measure values than some existing \{CIL\} methods. Based on the overall results, we can conclude that the proposed FTM-SVM method is effective for \{CIL\} problem, especially in the presence of outliers and noise in data sets. "}

Due to uncertainty of the parameters in real-world systems, processing times and due dates of jobs are represented here with triangular fuzzy numbers. Using the credibility measure, a nonlinear mathematical model is provided based on fuzzy chance-constrained programming (FCCP) with the aim to minimize two objective functions, namely total earliness/tardiness (ET) and maximum completion time of jobs (makespan). Since it is a mixed integer nonlinear mathematical model, there is no guarantee that the solution will obtain a global optimum. Therefore, a multi-objective branch and bound algorithm is provided by introducing an effective lower bound in order to obtain a Pareto optimal front. Computational results show that the algorithm proposed is especially useful to solve large-scale problems. "}

However, it is less effective to tackle such complex queries by simply aggregating the individual search results for the constituent concepts. In this paper, we propose to introduce the learning to rank techniques to concept-based image search for complex queries. With freely available social tagged images, we first build concept detectors by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous visual features. Then, to formulate the image relevance, we explicitly model the individual weight of each constituent concept in a complex query. The dependence among constituent concepts, as well as the relatedness between query and non-query concepts, are also considered through modeling the pairwise concept correlations in a factorization way. Finally, we train our model to directly optimize the image ranking performance for complex queries under a pairwise learning to rank framework. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets well verified the promise of our approach. "}

Incorporation of the created massive hydraulic fractures explicitly into the simulation model is the major challenge during the model development and computation phases. A pattern recognition-based proxy model is our proposed technique to overcome the aforementioned problem by modeling time successive shale gas production at the hydraulic fracture cluster level at different time resolutions (Short-, medium- and long term). Ensemble of multiple, interconnected adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems create the core for the development of the shale proxy models. In this approach, unlike reduced order models, the physics and the space-time resolution are not reduced. Instead of using pre-defined functional forms that are more frequently used to develop response surfaces, a series of machine learning algorithms that conform to the system theory are used. A history-matched Marcellus shale gas pad with six horizontal laterals and 169 clusters of hydraulic fracture is used as a base case for shale proxy model development. Additionally, several realizations are defined in order to capture the uncertainties inherent in the shale simulation model. The proxy model is validated using a blind simulation run that is not used during the model development process. The developed shale proxy model re-generates the simulation results for methane production for 169 clusters hydraulic fracture in a second with high accuracy (&lt;15% error), thus making a comprehensive analysis of production from shale a practical and feasible option. Moreover, it can be used as an assisted history-matching tool, since it has the capability to scrutinize the solution space and produce the model response to the uncertainty changes very fast. "}

Although the results currently achievable with automatic sleep staging methods are promising, there is need for improvement, especially given the time-consuming and tedious nature of visual sleep scoring. New method Here we propose a sleep staging framework that consists of a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classification based on a decision tree approach. The performance of the method was evaluated using polysomnographic data from 15 subjects (electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings). The decision tree, or dendrogram, was obtained using a hierarchical clustering technique and a wide range of time and frequency-domain features were extracted. Feature selection was carried out using forward sequential selection and classification was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. Results The dendrogram-based \{SVM\} (DSVM) achieved mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.92, 0.74 and 0.88 respectively, compared to expert visual scoring. Restricting \{DSVM\} classification to data where both experts’ scoring was consistent (76.73% of the data) led to a mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.94, 0.82 and 0.92 respectively. Comparison with existing methods The \{DSVM\} framework outperforms classification with more standard multi-class “one-against-all” \{SVM\} and linear-discriminant analysis. Conclusion The promising results of the proposed methodology suggest that it may be a valuable alternative to existing automatic methods and that it could accelerate visual scoring by providing a robust starting hypnogram that can be further fine-tuned by expert inspection.

However, because \{SWE\} varies significantly over space, the estimation of \{SWE\} at the catchment scale based on a single-point measurement is error-prone. We propose low-cost, lightweight methods for near-real-time estimation of mean catchment-wide \{SWE\} using existing infrastructure, wireless sensor networks, and machine learning algorithms. Because snowpack distribution is highly nonlinear, we focus on Genetic Programming (GP), a nonlinear, white-box, inductive machine learning algorithm. Because we did not have access to near-real-time catchment-scale \{SWE\} data, we used available data as ground truth for machine learning in a set of experiments that are successive approximations of our goal of catchment-wide \{SWE\} estimation. First, we used a history of maritime snowpack data collected by manual snow courses. Second, we used distributed snow depth (HS) data collected automatically by wireless sensor networks. We compared the performance of \{GP\} against linear regression (LR), binary regression trees (BT), and a widely used basic method (BM) that naively assumes non-variable snowpack. In the first experiment set, \{GP\} and \{LR\} models predicted \{SWE\} with lower error than BM. In the second experiment set, \{GP\} had lower error than LR, but outperformed \{BT\} only when we applied a technique that specifically mitigated the possibility of over-fitting. "}

To this purpose, we present an effective approach to estimate \{SBSTs\} by combining scarce in situ observations, multi-sensor remote sensing data and machine learning techniques. In particular, an approach is introduced, which deploys a sequential procedure comprising five main steps, namely calculation of features from remote sensing data, feature selection, outlier detection, generation of synthetic samples, and supervised classification under consideration of both Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. Experimental results obtained for a representative study area, including large parts of the city of Padang (Indonesia), assess the capabilities of the presented approach and confirm its great potential for a reliable area-wide estimation of \{SBSTs\} and an effective earthquake loss modeling based on remote sensing, which should be further explored in future research activities.

In structured prediction, this internal structure is used to predict multiple outputs simultaneously, leading to more accurate and coherent predictions. Structural support vector machines (SSVMs) are nonprobabilistic models that optimize a joint input–output function through margin-based learning. Because \{SSVMs\} generally disregard the interplay between unary and interaction factors during the training phase, final parameters are suboptimal. Moreover, its factors are often restricted to linear combinations of input features, limiting its generalization power. To improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes: (i) joint inference and learning by integration of back-propagation and loss-augmented inference in \{SSVM\} subgradient descent; (ii) extending \{SSVM\} factors to neural networks that form highly nonlinear functions of input features. Image segmentation benchmark results demonstrate improvements over conventional \{SSVM\} training methods in terms of accuracy, highlighting the feasibility of end-to-end \{SSVM\} training with neural factors.

abstract = {"Background Parathyroidectomy offers the only cure for primary hyperparathyroidism, but today only 50% of primary hyperparathyroidism patients are referred for operation, in large part, because the condition is widely under-recognized. The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism can be especially challenging with mild biochemical indices. Machine learning is a collection of methods in which computers build predictive algorithms based on labeled examples. With the aim of facilitating diagnosis, we tested the ability of machine learning to distinguish primary hyperparathyroidism from normal physiology using clinical and laboratory data. Methods This retrospective cohort study used a labeled training set and 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate accuracy of the algorithm. Measures of accuracy included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision (sensitivity), and positive and negative predictive value. Several different algorithms and ensembles of algorithms were tested using the Weka platform. Among 11,830 patients managed operatively at 3 high-volume endocrine surgery programs from March 2001 to August 2013, 6,777 underwent parathyroidectomy for confirmed primary hyperparathyroidism, and 5,053 control patients without primary hyperparathyroidism underwent thyroidectomy. Test-set accuracies for machine learning models were determined using 10-fold cross-validation. Age, sex, and serum levels of preoperative calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and creatinine were defined as potential predictors of primary hyperparathyroidism. Mild primary hyperparathyroidism was defined as primary hyperparathyroidism with normal preoperative calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. Results After testing a variety of machine learning algorithms, Bayesian network models proved most accurate, classifying correctly 95.2% of all primary hyperparathyroidism patients (area under receiver operating characteristic = 0.989). Omitting parathyroid hormone from the model did not decrease the accuracy significantly (area under receiver operating characteristic = 0.985). In mild disease cases, however, the Bayesian network model classified correctly 71.1% of patients with normal calcium and 92.1% with normal parathyroid hormone levels preoperatively. Bayesian networking and AdaBoost improved the accuracy of all parathyroid hormone patients to 97.2% cases (area under receiver operating characteristic = 0.994), and 91.9% of primary hyperparathyroidism patients with mild disease. This was significantly improved relative to Bayesian networking alone (P &lt; .0001). Conclusion Machine learning can diagnose accurately primary hyperparathyroidism without human input even in mild disease. Incorporation of this tool into electronic medical record systems may aid in recognition of this under-diagnosed disorder. "}

Iron supplement and especially Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) have become the treatment of choice for that anemia. However, it is very complicated to find an adequate treatment for every patient in each particular situation since dosage guidelines are based on average behaviors, and thus, they do not take into account the particular response to those drugs by different patients, although that response may vary enormously from one patient to another and even for the same patient in different stages of the anemia. This work proposes an advance with respect to previous works that have faced this problem using different methodologies (Machine Learning (ML), among others), since the diversity of the \{CKD\} population has been explicitly taken into account in order to produce a general and reliable model for the prediction of ESA/Iron therapy response. Furthermore, the \{ML\} model makes use of both human physiology and drug pharmacology to produce a model that outperforms previous approaches, yielding Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of the Hemoglobin (Hb) prediction around or lower than 0.6 g/dl in the three countries analyzed in the study, namely, Spain, Italy and Portugal.

In this paper, the ideas behind CP-ELM and DP-ELM are extended to the regularized \{ELM\} (RELM), thus obtaining CP-RELM and DP-RELM. For CP-RELM(DP-RELM), there are two schemes to realize it, viz. CP-RELM-I and CP-RELM-II(DP-RELM-I and DP-RELM-II). Generally speaking, CP-RELM-II(DP-RELM-II) outperforms CP-RELM-I(DP-RELM-I) in terms of parsimoniousness. Under nearly the same generalization, compared with CP-ELM(DP-ELM), CP-RELM-II(DP-RELM-II) usually needs fewer hidden nodes. In addition, different from CP-ELM and DP-ELM, for CP-RELM and DP-RELM the number of candidate hidden nodes may be larger than the number of training samples, which assists the selection of much better hidden nodes for constructing more compact networks. Finally, eleven benchmark data sets divided into two groups are utilized to do experiments and the usefulness of the proposed algorithms is reported. "}

A review of the literature reveals that most researchers paid more attention to the scheduling with both the single-machine settings and the learning without a bound. This is at odds with reality and thereby highlights the importance of addressing the issue by different approaches. This paper tackles the issue by considering a two-machine flowshop problem with a truncated learning consideration where the objective function is to minimize the makespan. In order to solve the proposed model, a branch-and-bound algorithm is first developed for the optimal solution. Then four genetic heuristic-based algorithms are proposed for the near-optimal solution. In addition, the experimental results of all proposed algorithms are also provided. "}

In particular, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of a novel feature selection method based on a special class of Genetic Algorithm (with restricted search) hybridized with a Extreme Learning Machine. Because of its great generalization performance at a very fast learning speed, the Extreme Learning Machine plays the key role of providing the fitness of candidate solutions in each generation of the Genetic Algorithm. After a number of experiments comparing its performance to that of other fast learning algorithms, our approach has been found to be the most feasible for the application at hand. The proposed method helps the Extreme Learning Machine-based classifier to increase its performance from a mean probability of correct classification of 74.83% (with no feature selection) up to 93.74% (when using the optimum subset of selected features).

The main energy for it is the combustion of coke, which consists primary of carbon. In order to improve the carbon efficiency, it is necessary to predict it. A comprehensive carbon ratio (CCR) was used to be the metric for estimating the carbon efficiency. An iron ore sintering process has the characteristics of autocorrelation of time series of CCR, multiple variables, linearity and nonlinearity, and time delay. In this study, a hybrid time series prediction model was built to predict the \{CCR\} based on these characteristics. It consists of two parts: time series prediction based on Elman recurrent neural network (RNN) and Elman-residuals prediction based on double joint linear-nonlinear extreme learning network (JLNELN). The Elman \{RNN\} with a context layer has the ability to model the dynamical and nonlinear components in the time series, and the double \{JLNELN\} with the input neurons not only connected to the hidden neurons but also to the output neurons has the ability to model both the nonlinear and linear components in the prediction residuals. Actual run data was collected to verify the validity of the devised hybrid model. Experiment results have shown that the hybrid model achieved much higher regression precision than a single Elman RNN, which shows the necessity and validity of the double \{JLNELN\} model in the prediction of the Elman residuals. The experiment results of the double \{JLNELN\} method also show higher regression precision than both a double extreme learning machine method and a single \{JLNELN\} method, which verified the validity of the \{JLNELN\} method and the double structure of the prediction model.

Thus, in the proposed \{CTLA\} a new phase named “chaotic phase” is added in order to overcome this drawback. The performance of the \{CTLA\} is investigated by using a set of benchmark functions.

Moreover, the differences between the two different representations are also minimized.

The semi-supervised learning method is a hybrid of supervised and unsupervised learning approach that simultaneously uses both training and non-training data to design a classifier. By using the \{TSVM\} algorithm, exploration layers at the Dalli porphyry Cu-Au deposit in the central Iran were integrated to locate the boundary of the Cu-Au mineralization for further drilling. By applying this algorithm on the non-training (unlabeled) and limited training (labeled) Dalli exploration data, the study area was classified in two domains of Cu-Au ore and waste. Then, the results were validated by the earlier block models created, using the available borehole and trench data. In addition to TSVM, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was also implemented on the study area for comparison. Thirty percent of the labeled exploration data was used to evaluate the performance of these two algorithms. The results revealed 87 percent correct recognition accuracy for the \{TSVM\} algorithm and 82 percent for the \{SVM\} algorithm. The deepest inclined borehole, recently drilled in the western part of the Dalli deposit, indicated that the boundary of Cu-Au mineralization, as identified by the \{TSVM\} algorithm, was only 15 m off from the actual boundary intersected by this borehole. According to the results of the \{TSVM\} algorithm, six new boreholes were suggested for further drilling at the Dalli deposit. This study showed that the \{TSVM\} algorithm could be a useful tool for enhancing the mineralization zones and consequently, ensuring a more accurate drill hole planning. "}

Among solutions reported in the literature, the stochastic estimator reward-inaction learning automaton (SERI), which belongs to the Maximum Likelihood estimator based LAs, has been recognized as the fastest ϵ-optimal LA. In this paper, we first point out the limitations of the traditional Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) based \{LAs\} and then introduce Bayesian estimator based approach, which is demonstrated to be equivalent to Laplace smoothing of the traditional method, to overcome these limitations. The key idea is that the Bayesian estimator, which estimates the probability of selecting each action in the LA, aims to reconstruct Bernoulli distribution from sequential data, and is formalized based on exponential conjugate family so that the \{LA\} has a relatively simple format for easy implementation. In addition, we also indicate that this Bayesian estimator could be applied to update almost all existing \{MLE\} estimator based LAs. Based on the proposed Bayesian estimator, a new LA, known as Generalized Bayesian Stochastic Estimator (GBSE) LA, is presented and proved to be ϵ-optimal. Finally, extensive experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed learning scheme is more efficient than the current best \{LA\} SERI. "}

Active learning (AL) provides a unique capability at selecting samples with high representation quality and low redundancy. The most important part of \{AL\} is the criterion for selecting the most informative candidates (pixels) by ranking. In this paper, class supports based on the posterior probability function are approximated by ensemble learning and majority voting. This approximation is statistically meaningful when a large enough classifier ensemble is exploited. In this work, we propose to use extreme learning machines and apply \{AL\} to quad-polarimetric \{SAR\} image classification. Extreme learning machines are ideal because of their fast operation, straightforward solution and strong generalization. As inputs to the so-called active extreme learning machines, both polarimetric and spatial features (morphological profiles) are considered. In order to validate the proposed method, results and performance are compared with random sampling and state-of-the-art \{AL\} methods, such as margin sampling, normalized entropy query-by-bagging and multiclass level uncertainty. Experimental results for four quad-polarimetric \{SAR\} images collected by RADARSAT-2, AirSAR and \{EMISAR\} indicate that the proposed method achieves promising results in different scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method is faster than existing techniques in both the learning and the classification phases. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Extreme learning machine (ELM), a simple single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural network with fast implementation, has been successfully applied in many fields. This paper proposes an \{ELM\} with a constructional structure (CS-ELM) for improving the performance of \{ELM\} in dealing with regression problems. In the CS-ELM, there are some partial input subnets (PISs). The first step in designing the \{PISs\} is to divide the data-attribute-space into several sub-spaces through using an improved extension clustering algorithm (IECA). The input data attributes in the same sub-space can build a \{PIS\} and the similar information of the data attributes is stored in the corresponding PIS. Additionally, a double parallel structure is applied in the CS-ELM, in which there is a special channel that directly connects the input layer neurons to the output layer neurons. In this regard, the proposed procedure can be called \{ELM\} with a data-attribute-space-oriented double parallel (DASODP) structure (DASODP–ELM). To test the validity of the proposed method, it is applied to 4 regression applications. The experimental results indicate that, compared with ELM, DASODP–ELM with less number of parameters can achieve higher regression precision in the generalization phase. "}

abstract = {"Abstract We extend extreme learning machine (ELM) classifiers to complex Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) where the input/output variables as well as the optimization variables are complex-valued. A new family of classifiers, called complex-valued \{ELM\} (CELM) suitable for complex-valued multiple-input–multiple-output processing is introduced. In the proposed method, the associated Lagrangian is computed using induced \{RKHS\} kernels, adopting a Wirtinger calculus approach formulated as a constrained optimization problem similarly to the conventional \{ELM\} classifier formulation. When training the CELM, the Karush–Khun–Tuker (KKT) theorem is used to solve the dual optimization problem that consists of satisfying simultaneously smallest training error as well as smallest norm of output weights criteria. The proposed formulation also addresses aspects of quaternary classification within a Clifford algebra context. For 2D complex-valued inputs, user-defined complex-coupled hyper-planes divide the classifier input space into four partitions. For 3D complex-valued inputs, the formulation generates three pairs of complex-coupled hyper-planes through orthogonal projections. The six hyper-planes then divide the 3D space into eight partitions. It is shown that the \{CELM\} problem formulation is equivalent to solving six real-valued \{ELM\} tasks, which are induced by projecting the chosen complex kernel across the different user-defined coordinate planes. A classification example of powdered samples on the basis of their terahertz spectral signatures is used to demonstrate the advantages of the \{CELM\} classifiers compared to their \{SVM\} counterparts. The proposed classifiers retain the advantages of their \{ELM\} counterparts, in that they can perform multiclass classification with lower computational complexity than \{SVM\} classifiers. Furthermore, because of their ability to perform classification tasks fast, the proposed formulations are of interest to real-time applications. "}

The conventional method of detecting malicious webpages is going through the black list and checking whether the webpages are listed. Black list is a list of webpages which are classified as malicious from a user’s point of view. These black lists are created by trusted organizations and volunteers. They are then used by modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. However, black list is ineffective because of the frequent-changing nature of webpages, growing numbers of webpages that pose scalability issues and the crawlers’ inability to visit intranet webpages that require computer operators to log in as authenticated users. In this paper therefore alternative and novel approaches are used by applying machine learning algorithms to detect malicious webpages. In this paper three supervised machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes Classifier, and two unsupervised machine learning techniques such as K-Means and Affinity Propagation are employed. Please note that K-Means and Affinity Propagation have not been applied to detection of malicious webpages by other researchers. All these machine learning techniques have been used to build predictive models to analyze large number of malicious and safe webpages. These webpages were downloaded by a concurrent crawler taking advantage of gevent. The webpages were parsed and various features such as content, \{URL\} and screenshot of webpages were extracted to feed into the machine learning models. Computer simulation results have produced an accuracy of up to 98% for the supervised techniques and silhouette coefficient of close to 0.96 for the unsupervised techniques. These predictive models have been applied in a practical context whereby Google Chrome can harness the predictive capabilities of the classifiers that have the advantages of both the lightweight and the heavyweight classifiers.

When the environment is large and there are a large number of possible actions the robot can take, this exploration phase can take prohibitively long. However, exploration can often be optimised by letting a human expert guide the robot during its learning. Interactive machine learning, in which a human user interactively guides the robot as it learns, has been shown to be an effective way to teach a robot. It requires an intuitive control mechanism to allow the human expert to provide feedback on the robot’s progress. This paper presents a novel method which combines Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Progressively Autonomous Robot Competencies (SPARC). By allowing the user to fully control the robot and by treating rewards as implicit, \{SPARC\} aims to learn an action policy while maintaining human supervisory oversight of the robot’s behaviour. This method is evaluated and compared to Interactive Reinforcement Learning in a robot teaching task. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate that \{SPARC\} allows for safer and faster learning by the robot, whilst not placing a high workload on the human teacher. "}

Although very large, such datasets can also be quite sparse (e.g., device data may only be available for a small subset of individuals), which creates problems for traditional regression models. Many machine learning methods address such limitations effectively but are still subject to the usual sources of bias that commonly arise in observational studies.

There are various machine learning techniques used in the past for predicting faults. Method In this study we perform a systematic review of studies from January 1991 to October 2013 in the literature that use the machine learning techniques for software fault prediction. We assess the performance capability of the machine learning techniques in existing research for software fault prediction. We also compare the performance of the machine learning techniques with the statistical techniques and other machine learning techniques. Further the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning techniques are summarized. Results In this paper we have identified 64 primary studies and seven categories of the machine learning techniques. The results prove the prediction capability of the machine learning techniques for classifying module/class as fault prone or not fault prone. The models using the machine learning techniques for estimating software fault proneness outperform the traditional statistical models. Conclusion Based on the results obtained from the systematic review, we conclude that the machine learning techniques have the ability for predicting software fault proneness and can be used by software practitioners and researchers. However, the application of the machine learning techniques in software fault prediction is still limited and more number of studies should be carried out in order to obtain well formed and generalizable results. We provide future guidelines to practitioners and researchers based on the results obtained in this work. "}

Compared to other learning methods for Single Layer Feedforward Networks (SLFNs), the unique feature of the \{ELM\} is that the input parameters of hidden neurons are randomly generated rather than being iteratively tuned, and thereby dramatically reducing the computational burden. However, it has been pointed out that the randomness of the \{ELM\} parameters would result in fluctuating performance. In this paper, we systematically investigate the performance stabilization effect brought by a regularized variant of the ELM, named Regularized \{ELM\} (RELM). Furthermore, by using the \{PREdiction\} Sum of Squares (PRESS) statistics formula and a unique property of the RELM, we propose a semi-cross-validation algorithm to effectively realize a robust RELM-based model selection for SLFNs, termed as Automatic Regularized Extreme Learning Machine with Leave-One-Out cross-validation (AR-ELM-LOO). The simulation results show that the AR-ELM-LOO can significantly reduce the randomness performance of the \{ELM\} and it can produce nearly identical results as the full cross-validation procedure.

The prediction is confirmed by our experiments on 15 data sets using one kind of activation function with every parameter independently drawn from the same Guasssian distribution, which satisfies the assumption above.

MapReduce is a simple, scalable and fault-tolerant data processing framework that enables us to process a massive volume of data. Many machine learning algorithms have been designed based on MapReduce, but there are only a few works related to parallel extreme learning machine (ELM) which is a fast and accurate learning algorithm. Online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is one of improved \{ELM\} algorithms to support online sequential learning efficiently. In this paper, we first analyze the dependency relationships of matrix calculations of OS-ELM, then propose a parallel online sequential extreme learning machine (POS-ELM) based on MapReduce. POS-ELM is evaluated with real and synthetic data with the maximum number of training data 1280 K and the maximum number of attributes 128. The experimental results show that the training accuracy and testing accuracy of POS-ELM are at the same level as those of OS-ELM and ELM, and it has good scalability with regard to the number of training data and the number of attributes. Compared to original \{ELM\} and OS-ELM where the capability to process large scale data is bounded by the limitation of resources within a single processing unit, POS-ELM can deal with much larger scale data. The larger the number of training data is, the higher the speedup of POS-ELM is. It can be concluded that POS-ELM has more powerful capability than both \{ELM\} and OS-ELM for large scale learning.

In this paper, we present \{MLIMAS\} a framework for Machine Learning in Interactive Multi-Agent Systems. The \{MLIMAS\} is proposed to provide answers to the issues arising from integrating machine learning algorithms in interactive multi-agent systems, focusing on three questions i) what are the learning targets for agents?, (ii) how can the machine learning system be integrated into the agent architecture?, and (iii) how can agents learn interactively?. \{MLIMAS\} addresses those three questions plus supporting multi-agent systems consisting of autonomous and adaptive agents acting in real-time and noisy environments. As a result of such required capabilities, \{MLIMAS\} allows dynamic and intelligent behavior of the agents to efficiently achieve their local and coalition goals such through modeling other agents actions, and interactively taking benefits of self and others preferences in learning and achieving the agents goals. We studied the proposed framework in the Taxi Domain compared with the traditional Q-Learning algorithm without interactive share of information.

abstract = {"AbstractObjective Manual evaluation of machine learning algorithms and selection of a suitable classifier from the list of available candidate classifiers, is highly time consuming and challenging task. If the selection is not carefully and accurately done, the resulting classification model will not be able to produce the expected performance results. In this study, we present an accurate multi-criteria decision making methodology (AMD) which empirically evaluates and ranks classifiers’ and allow end users or experts to choose the top ranked classifier for their applications to learn and build classification models for them. Methods and material Existing classifiers performance analysis and recommendation methodologies lack (a) appropriate method for suitable evaluation criteria selection, (b) relative consistent weighting mechanism, (c) fitness assessment of the classifiers’ performances, and (d) satisfaction of various constraints during the analysis process. To assist machine learning practitioners in the selection of suitable classifier(s), \{AMD\} methodology is proposed that presents an expert group-based criteria selection method, relative consistent weighting scheme, a new ranking method, called optimum performance ranking criteria, based on multiple evaluation metrics, statistical significance and fitness assessment functions, and implicit and explicit constraints satisfaction at the time of analysis. For ranking the classifiers performance, the proposed ranking method integrates Wgt.Avg.F-score, CPUTimeTesting, CPUTimeTraining, and Consistency measures using the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The final relative closeness score produced by TOPSIS, is ranked and the practitioners select the best performance (top-ranked) classifier for their problems in-hand. Findings Based on the extensive experiments performed on 15 publically available \{UCI\} and OpenML datasets using 35 classification algorithms from heterogeneous families of classifiers, an average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.98 is observed. Similarly, the \{AMD\} method has showed improved performance of 0.98 average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as compared to 0.83 and 0.045 correlation coefficient of the state-of-the-art ranking methods, performance of algorithms (PAlg) and adjusted ratio of ratio (ARR). Conclusion and implication The evaluation, empirical analysis of results and comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the feasibility of \{AMD\} methodology, especially the selection and weighting of right evaluation criteria, accurate ranking and selection of optimum performance classifier(s) for the user's application's data in hand. \{AMD\} reduces expert's time and efforts and improves system performance by designing suitable classifier recommended by \{AMD\} methodology.

Recently, it has been proved that \{ELM\} outperforms Support Vector Machine (SVM) with less constraints from the optimization point of view. \{ELM\} provides unified learning schemes with a widespread type of feature mappings. Among these unified algorithms, \{ELM\} with kernels applies kernels instead of random feature mappings. However, with the exponentially increasing volume of training data in massive learning applications, centralized \{ELM\} with kernels suffers from the great memory consumption of large matrix operations. Besides, due to the high communication cost, some of these matrix operations cannot be directly implemented on shared-nothing distributed computing model like MapReduce. This paper proposes a distributed solution named Distributed Kernelized \{ELM\} (DK-ELM), which realizes an implementation of \{ELM\} with kernels on MapReduce. Distributed kernel matrix calculation and multiplication of matrix with vector are also applied to realize parallel calculation of DK-ELM. Extensive experiments on massive datasets are conducted to verify both the scalability and training performance of DK-ELM. Experimental results show that DK-ELM has good scalability for massive learning applications. "}

Though the distributed ELM⁎ based on MapReduce framework can handle very large scale training dataset in big data applications, how to cope with its rapidly updating is still a challenging task. Therefore, in this paper, a novel Elastic Extreme Learning Machine based on MapReduce framework, named Elastic \{ELM\} (E2LM), is proposed to cover the shortage of ELM⁎ whose learning ability is weak to the updated large-scale training dataset. Firstly, after analyzing the property of ELM⁎ adequately, it can be found out that its most computation-expensive part, matrix multiplication, can be incrementally, decrementally and correctionally calculated. Next, the Elastic \{ELM\} based on MapReduce framework is developed, which first calculates the intermediate matrix multiplications of the updated training data subset, and then update the matrix multiplications by modifying the old matrix multiplications with the intermediate ones. Then, the corresponding new output weight vector can be obtained with centralized computing using the update the matrix multiplications. Therefore, the efficient learning of rapidly updated massive training dataset can be realized effectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic data to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed \{E2LM\} in learning massive rapidly updated training dataset with various experimental settings.

abstract = {"AbstractObjective To develop a machine learning (ML) methodology based on features extracted from odd-ball auditory evoked potentials to identify neurophysiologic changes induced by Clozapine (CLZ) treatment in responding schizophrenic (SCZ) subjects. This objective is of particular interest because CLZ, though a potentially dangerous drug, can be uniquely effective for otherwise medication-resistant \{SCZ\} subjects. We wish to determine whether \{ML\} methods can be used to identify a set of EEG-based discriminating features that can simultaneously (1) distinguish all the \{SCZ\} subjects before treatment (BT) from healthy volunteer (HV) subjects, (2) distinguish \{EEGs\} collected before \{CLZ\} treatment (BT) vs. those collected after treatment (AT) for those subjects most responsive to CLZ, (3) discriminate least responsive subjects from \{HV\} AT, and (4) no longer discriminate most responsive subjects from \{HVs\} AT. If a set of EEG-derived features satisfy these four conditions, then it may be concluded that these features normalize in responsive subjects as a result of \{CLZ\} treatment, and therefore potentially provide insight into the functioning of the drug on the \{SCZ\} brain. Methods Odd-ball auditory evoked potentials of 66 \{HVs\} and 47 \{SCZ\} adults both \{BT\} and \{AT\} with \{CLZ\} were derived from \{EEG\} recordings. Treatment outcome, after at least one year follow-up, was assessed through clinical rating scores assigned by an experienced clinician, blind to \{EEG\} results. Using a criterion of at least 35% improvement after \{CLZ\} treatment, subjects were divided into “most-responsive” (MR) and “least-responsive” (LR) groups. As a first step, a brain source localization (BSL) procedure was employed on the \{EEG\} signals to extract source waveforms from specified brain regions. \{ML\} methods were then applied to these source waveform signals to determine whether a set of features satisfying the four conditions outlined above could be discovered. Results A set of cross-power spectral density (CPSD) features meeting these criteria was identified. These \{CPSD\} features, consisting of a combination of brain regional source activity and connectivity measures, significantly overlap with the default mode network (DMN). All decrease with \{CLZ\} treatment in responding SCZs. Conclusions A set of EEG-derived discriminating features which normalize as a result of \{CLZ\} treatment was identified. These discriminating features define a network that shares significant commonality with the DMN. Our findings are consistent with those of previous literature, which suggest that regions of the \{DMN\} are hyperactive and hyperconnected in \{SCZ\} subjects. Our study shows that these discriminating features decrease after treatment, consistent with portions of the \{DMN\} normalizing with \{CLZ\} therapy in responsive subjects. Significance Machine learning is proposed as a potentially powerful tool for analysis of the effect of medication on psychiatric illness. If replicated, the proposed approach could be used to gain some improved understanding of the effect of neuroleptic medications in treating psychotic illness. These results may also be useful in the development of new pharmaceuticals, since a new drug which induces changes in brain electrophysiology similar to those seen after \{CLZ\} could also have powerful antipsychotic properties.

Several automated or semi-automated detection technologies have been developed in the past among which infrasound-based detection is the most promising for regional-scale avalanche monitoring. However, due to significant ambient noise content in infrasonic signals, e.g. from atmospheric processes or airplanes, fully automated and reliable avalanche detection has been very challenging. Signal processing is highly critical and strongly affects detection accuracy. Here, a robust detection method by using supervised machine learning is introduced. Machine learning algorithms can take into account multiple signal features and statistically optimize the classification task. We analyzed infrasound data with concurrent visual avalanche observations from the test site Lavin (Eastern Swiss Alps) for the winter of 2011–2012. A support vector machine was trained by using training data from the first half of the winter season and the accuracy was tested on data from the second half of the season. A significant reduction of false detections, from 65% to 10%, was achieved compared to a threshold-based classifier provided by the sensor manufacturer. The proposed method enables reliable assessment of the avalanche activity in the surroundings of the system and paves the way towards robust and fully automated avalanche detection using infrasonic systems.

While the training with a reduced number of patterns can be a solution to this, it is often connected with decreasing model accuracies and increasing instabilities and noise. Hence, we propose a novel approach defined by a two criteria optimization task, where both the runtime and the quality of \{ML\} models are optimized. Because the budgets for this optimization task are usually very restricted in ML, the surrogate-assisted Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm is adapted. In order to cope with noisy experiments, we apply two hypervolume indicator based \{EGO\} algorithms with smoothing and re-interpolation of the surrogate models. The techniques do not need replicates. We find that these \{EGO\} techniques can outperform traditional approaches such as latin hypercube sampling (LHS), as well as \{EGO\} variants with replicates.

Data-driven model predictions using machine learning algorithms are promising tenets for these purposes as they require less developmental time, minimal inputs and are relatively less complex than the dynamic or physical model. This paper authenticates a computationally simple, fast and efficient non-linear algorithm known as extreme learning machine (ELM) for the prediction of Effective Drought Index (EDI) in eastern Australia using input data trained from 1957–2008 and the monthly \{EDI\} predicted over the period 2009–2011. The predictive variables for the \{ELM\} model were the rainfall and mean, minimum and maximum air temperatures, supplemented by the large-scale climate mode indices of interest as regression covariates, namely the Southern Oscillation Index, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode and the Indian Ocean Dipole moment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven model a performance comparison in terms of the prediction capabilities and learning speeds was conducted between the proposed \{ELM\} algorithm and the conventional artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm trained with Levenberg–Marquardt back propagation. The prediction metrics certified an excellent performance of the \{ELM\} over the \{ANN\} model for the overall test sites, thus yielding Mean Absolute Errors, Root-Mean Square Errors, Coefficients of Determination and Willmott's Indices of Agreement of 0.277, 0.008, 0.892 and 0.93 (for ELM) and 0.602, 0.172, 0.578 and 0.92 (for ANN) models. Moreover, the \{ELM\} model was executed with learning speed 32 times faster and training speed 6.1 times faster than the \{ANN\} model. An improvement in the prediction capability of the drought duration and severity by the \{ELM\} model was achieved. Based on these results we aver that out of the two machine learning algorithms tested, the \{ELM\} was the more expeditious tool for prediction of drought and its related properties. "}

The resulting MPC-based cruise controller is used to improve the driving safety and reduce the energy consumption of an electric vehicle (EV). The structural flexibility of OSELM–FTS allows us to not only improve the operating features of the EV, but also develop an intelligent supervisor which can detect any operating fault and send proper commands for the adaption of the \{MPC\} controller. This introduces a degree of robustness to the devised controller, as OSELM–FTS automatically detects and filters any operating faults which may undermine the performance of the \{MPC\} controller. To ascertain the veracity of the devised controller, three well-known \{MPC\} formulations, i.e. linear \{MPC\} (LMPC) and nonlinear \{MPC\} (NMPC) and diagonal recurrent neural network \{MPC\} (DRNN-MPC), are applied to the baseline \{EV\} and their performances are compared with OSELM–FTS-MPC. To further elaborate on the computational advantages of OSELM, a well-known chunk-by-chunk incremental machine learning approach, namely selective negative correlation learning (SNCL), is taken into account. The results of the comparative study indicate that OSELM–FTS-MPC is a very promising control scheme and can be reliably used for safety-oriented autonomous cruise control of the EVs. "}

The main merit of \{ELM\} lies in the fact that the input weights as well as hidden layer bias are randomly generated and thus the output weights can be obtained analytically, which can overcome the drawbacks incurred by gradient-based training algorithms such as local optima, improper learning rate and low learning speed. Based on the consistency property of data, which enforces similar samples to share similar properties, we propose a discriminative graph regularized Extreme Learning Machine (GELM) for further enhancing its classification performance in this paper. In the proposed \{GELM\} model, the label information of training samples are used to construct an adjacent graph and correspondingly the graph regularization term is formulated to constrain the output weights to learn similar outputs for samples from the same class. The proposed \{GELM\} model also has a closed form solution as the standard \{ELM\} and thus the output weights can be obtained efficiently. Experiments on several widely used face databases show that our proposed \{GELM\} can achieve much performance gain over standard \{ELM\} and regularized ELM. Moreover, \{GELM\} also performs well when compared with the state-of-the-art classification methods for face recognition. "}

In this work, we parallelize an \{ELM\} algorithm for unsupervised learning on a distributed framework to learn clustering models from big data based on the unsupervised \{ELM\} algorithm proposed in the literature. We propose three approaches to do so: 1) Parallel US-ELM which simply distributes the data over computing nodes, 2) Hierarchical US-ELM which hierarchically clusters the data and 3) Ensemble US- \{ELM\} which is an ensemble of weak \{ELM\} models. The algorithms achieved faster training times compared to their serial counterparts and generalized better than other clustering algorithms in the literature, when tested on multiple datasets from UCI.

These reviews and blogs may be classified into different polarity groups such as positive, negative, and neutral in order to extract information from the input dataset. Supervised machine learning methods help to classify these reviews. In this paper, four different machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes (NB), Maximum Entropy (ME), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been considered for classification of human sentiments.

However, existing \{ELM\} and its variants predominantly employ single hidden layer feedforward networks, leaving the popular and potentially powerful stacked generalization principle unexploited for seeking predictive deep representations of input data. Deep architectures can find higher-level representations, thus can potentially capture relevant higher-level abstractions. But most of current deep learning methods require solving a difficult and non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a stacked model, DrELM, to learn deep representations via extreme learning machine according to stacked generalization philosophy. The proposed model utilizes \{ELM\} as a base building block and incorporates random shift and kernelization as stacking elements. Specifically, in each layer, DrELM integrates a random projection of the predictions obtained by \{ELM\} into the original feature, and then applies kernel functions to generate the resultant feature. To verify the classification and regression performance of DrELM, we conduct the experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets. The experimental results show that DrELM outperforms \{ELM\} and kernel ELMs, which appear to demonstrate that DrELM could yield predictive features that are suitable for prediction tasks. The performances of the deep models (i.e. Stacked Auto-encoder) are comparable. However, due to the utilization of ELM, DrELM is easier to learn and faster in testing. "}

These nonlinear techniques start to outperform their simple counterparts for forecasting horizons greater than 1 h. "}

To apply deep learning to these datasets owned by multiple data owners on cloud, we need to tackle two challenges: (i) the data are encrypted with different keys, all operations including intermediate results must be secure; and (ii) the computational cost and the communication cost of the data owner(s) should be kept minimal. In our work, we propose two schemes to solve the above problems. We first present a basic scheme based on multi-key fully homomorphic encryption (MK-FHE), then we propose an advanced scheme based on a hybrid structure by combining the double decryption mechanism and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). We also prove that these two multi-key privacy-preserving deep learning schemes over encrypted data are secure. "}

It is important to evaluate the performance degradation and estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for those batteries. With the capability of uncertainty representation and management, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) becomes an effective approach for lithium-ion battery \{RUL\} estimation. However, small sample size and low precision of multi-step prediction limits its application in battery \{RUL\} estimation for sparse \{RVM\} algorithm. Due to the continuous on-line update of monitoring data, to improve the prediction performance of battery \{RUL\} model, dynamic training and on-line learning capability is desirable. Another challenge in on-line and real-time processing is the operating efficiency and computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper implements a flexible and effective on-line training strategy in \{RVM\} algorithm to enhance the prediction ability, and presents an incremental optimized \{RVM\} algorithm to the model via efficient on-line training. The proposed on-line training strategy achieves a better prediction precision as well as improves the operating efficiency for battery \{RUL\} estimation. Experiments based on \{NASA\} battery data set show that the proposed method yields a satisfied performance in \{RUL\} estimation of lithium-ion battery. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Extreme learning machine (ELM) has been an important research topic over the last decade due to its high efficiency, easy-implementation, unification of classification and regression, and unification of binary and multi-class learning tasks. Though integrating these advantages, existing \{ELM\} algorithms pay little attention to optimizing the choice of kernels, which is indeed crucial to the performance of \{ELM\} in applications. More importantly, there is the lack of a general framework for \{ELM\} to integrate multiple heterogeneous data sources for classification. In this paper, we propose a general learning framework, termed multiple kernel extreme learning machines (MK-ELM), to address the above two issues. In the proposed MK-ELM, the optimal kernel combination weights and the structural parameters of \{ELM\} are jointly optimized. Following recent research on support vector machine (SVM) based \{MKL\} algorithms, we first design a sparse MK-ELM algorithm by imposing an ℓ1-norm constraint on the kernel combination weights, and then extend it to a non-sparse scenario by substituting the ℓ1-norm constraint with an ℓp-norm ( p &gt; 1 ) constraint. After that, a radius-incorporated MK-ELM algorithm which incorporates the radius of the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) is introduced. Three efficient optimization algorithms are proposed to solve the corresponding kernel learning problems. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on Protein, Oxford Flower17, Caltech101 and Alzheimer׳s disease data sets to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. As the experimental results indicate, our proposed algorithms can achieve comparable or even better classification performance than state-of-the-art \{MKL\} algorithms, while incurring much less computational cost.

However, the determination of network topology is difficult and time consuming. Therefore, we propose a new type of neural network, extreme learning machine (ELM), to improve the efficiency of \{LOD\} predictions. Earth orientation parameters (EOP) \{C04\} time-series provides daily values from International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), which serves as our database. First, the known predictable effects that can be described by functional models—such as the effects of solid earth, ocean tides, or seasonal atmospheric variations—are removed a priori from the \{C04\} time-series. Only the residuals after the subtraction of a priori model from the observed \{LOD\} data (i.e., the irregular and quasi-periodic variations) are employed for training and predictions. The predicted \{LOD\} is the sum of a prior extrapolation model and the \{ELM\} predictions of the residuals. Different input patterns are discussed and compared to optimize the network solution. The prediction results are analyzed and compared with those obtained by other machine learning-based prediction methods, including BPNN, generalization regression neural networks (GRNN), and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). It is shown that while achieving similar prediction accuracy, the developed method uses much less training time than other methods. Furthermore, to conduct a direct comparison with the existing prediction techniques, the mean-absolute-error (MAE) from the proposed method is compared with that from the \{EOP\} prediction comparison campaign (EOP PCC). The results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed method is comparable with that of the former techniques. The implementation of the proposed method is simple. "}

However, how to evaluate fuzzy membership becomes the key point to FSVM. Moreover, these learning machines present disadvantages to process matrix patterns. In order to process matrix patterns and to tackle the imbalance problem, this paper proposes an entropy-based matrix learning machine for imbalanced data sets, adopting the Matrix-pattern-oriented Ho–Kashyap learning machine with regularization learning (MatMHKS) as the base classifier.

Experiments on real-world imbalanced data sets validate that \{EMatMHKS\} outperforms compared learning machines. "}

The hypothesis of this research was based on the assumption that some regional \{NFs\} deviate from the \{EU\} \{NFs\} due to unique regional profiles, or because of previously omitted or generalized human impact. In this particular case study set in Slovenia has been tested. By working on the ReCiPe 1.08 life cycle impact assessment methodology, 18 impact categories were investigated, and an additional 3 were added: electromagnetic radiation, light pollution and electric use. To meet practitioners’ needs, the most up-to-date inventory data was used with the reference years of 2007–2012. Out of 440 environmental interventions that were investigated, 139 had no characterization factors (CFs), 97 were estimated using machine learning and 42 had to be omitted. The final result confirmed our hypothesis. Twenty \{NFs\} were compared with the \{EU\} NFs, and the results have shown that on average, the \{NFs\} differ by a factor of 9.76 (median = 1.65). The reasons for the high deviation are due to natural land transformation, and ionising radiation, toxicological and ecotoxicological impact categories; where there are major data gaps in the CFs. The primary concern of the research was data availability for toxicological and ecotoxicological parameters for toxicity-related emissions, and the fact that original \{CFs\} covered only 50.25% of plant protection products used in Slovenia. Toxicological and ecotoxicological uncertainties were illustrated by comparing four different results. Future studies should be focused on the use of machine learning to provide the next generation of \{CFs\} and to go beyond the CFs’ damage-oriented assessment. Remediation should be the new endpoint category and its units should be Joules. "}

Elsewhere (Greene, 2013) I’ve argued that moral intuitions offer reasonably good advice concerning the give-and-take of everyday social life, addressing the basic problem of cooperation within a “tribe” (“Me vs. Us”), but that moral intuitions offer unreliable advice concerning disagreements between tribes with competing interests and values (“Us vs. Them”). Here I argue that a computational perspective on moral learning underscores these conclusions. The acquisition of good moral intuitions requires both good (representative) data and good (value-aligned) training. In the case of inter-tribal disagreement (public moral controversy), the problem of bad training looms large, as training processes may simply reinforce tribal differences. With respect to moral philosophy and the paradoxical problems it addresses, the problem of bad data looms large, as theorists seek principles that minimize counter-intuitive implications, not only in typical real-world cases, but in unusual, often hypothetical, cases such as some trolley dilemmas. In such cases the prevailing real-world relationships between actions and consequences are severed or reversed, yielding intuitions that give the right answers to the wrong questions. Such intuitions—which we may experience as the voice of duty or virtue—may simply reflect the computational limitations inherent in affective learning. I conclude, in optimistic agreement with Railton, that progress in moral philosophy depends on our having a better understanding of the mechanisms behind our moral intuitions. "}

This paper presents the design, development and testing of a smart wireless sensor network (WSN) for leak detection and size estimation in long range pipelines. This system uses wireless communication and machine learning (WML) to learn, make decisions and report the critical events like slow /small leakages in natural gas/oil pipeline autonomously.

In machine learning, we use support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and Naive bayes in multi- dimensional feature space. The proposed technique is investigated for performance and capabilities by a series of trials on a field deployed test bed, with regard to performance of leakage detection and size estimation in pipelines.

The compressive strength of high performance concrete (HPC) is a major civil engineering problem. However, the validity of reported relationships between concrete ingredients and mechanical strength is questionable. This paper provides a comprehensive study using advanced \{ML\} techniques to predict the compressive strength of HPC. Specifically, individual and ensemble learning classifiers are constructed from four different base learners, including multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and linear regression (LR). For ensemble models that integrate multiple classifiers, the voting, bagging, and stacking combination methods are considered. The behavior simulation capabilities of these techniques are investigated using concrete data from several countries. The comparison results show that ensemble learning techniques are better than learning techniques used individually to predict \{HPC\} compressive strength. Although the two single best learning models are \{SVM\} and MLP, the stacking-based ensemble model composed of MLP/CART, SVM, and \{LR\} in the first level and \{SVM\} in the second level often achieves the best performance measures. This study validates the applicability of ML, voting, bagging, and stacking techniques for simple and efficient simulations of concrete compressive strength. "}

Such imbalance severely reduces bag-of-poses based classification performance. On the other hand, collecting a dataset of human gestures or actions is an expensive and time-consuming procedure. It is often impractical to reacquire the data or to modify the existing dataset using oversampling or undersampling procedures. The best way to handle such imbalance is by making the used classifier be directly aware and adapt to the real condition inside the data. Balancing class distribution, i.e., the number of pose samples per class, is one of difficult tasks in machine learning. Standard statistical learning models (e.g., SVM, HMM, CRF) are insensitive to unbalanced datasets. This paper proposes a distribution-sensitive prior on a standard statistical learning, i.e., Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), to deal with the imbalanced data problem. This prior analyzes the training dataset before learning a model. Thus, the \{RVM\} can put more weight on the samples from under-represented classes, while allows overall samples from the dataset to have a balanced impact to the learning process. Our experiment uses a publicly available gesture datasets, the Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 (MSRC-12). Experimental results show the importance of adapting to the unbalanced data and improving the recognition performance through distribution-sensitive prior. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Mapping the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic classes is important for informing soil use and management decisions. Digital soil mapping (DSM) can quantitatively predict the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic classes. Key components of \{DSM\} are the method and the set of environmental covariates used to predict soil classes. Machine learning is a general term for a broad set of statistical modeling techniques. Many different machine learning models have been applied in the literature and there are different approaches for selecting covariates for DSM. However, there is little guidance as to which, if any, machine learning model and covariate set might be optimal for predicting soil classes across different landscapes. Our objective was to compare multiple machine learning models and covariate sets for predicting soil taxonomic classes at three geographically distinct areas in the semi-arid western United States of America (southern New Mexico, southwestern Utah, and northeastern Wyoming). All three areas were the focus of digital soil mapping studies. Sampling sites at each study area were selected using conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). We compared models that had been used in other \{DSM\} studies, including clustering algorithms, discriminant analysis, multinomial logistic regression, neural networks, tree based methods, and support vector machine classifiers. Tested machine learning models were divided into three groups based on model complexity: simple, moderate, and complex. We also compared environmental covariates derived from digital elevation models and Landsat imagery that were divided into three different sets: 1) covariates selected a priori by soil scientists familiar with each area and used as input into cLHS, 2) the covariates in set 1 plus 113 additional covariates, and 3) covariates selected using recursive feature elimination. Overall, complex models were consistently more accurate than simple or moderately complex models. Random forests (RF) using covariates selected via recursive feature elimination was consistently the most accurate, or was among the most accurate, classifiers between study areas and between covariate sets within each study area. We recommend that for soil taxonomic class prediction, complex models and covariates selected by recursive feature elimination be used. Overall classification accuracy in each study area was largely dependent upon the number of soil taxonomic classes and the frequency distribution of pedon observations between taxonomic classes. Individual subgroup class accuracy was generally dependent upon the number of soil pedon observations in each taxonomic class. The number of soil classes is related to the inherent variability of a given area. The imbalance of soil pedon observations between classes is likely related to cLHS. Imbalanced frequency distributions of soil pedon observations between classes must be addressed to improve model accuracy. Solutions include increasing the number of soil pedon observations in classes with few observations or decreasing the number of classes. Spatial predictions using the most accurate models generally agree with expected soil–landscape relationships. Spatial prediction uncertainty was lowest in areas of relatively low relief for each study area. "}

Age estimation is a multiclass problem and the number of classes to predict is quite large. There surely is facial aging trend and faces from closed age range have some similar facial aging features. It is difficult to say there are distinct facial aging features for an age. Facial aging features are found to be overlapped among nearby age groups along the aging life and are continuous in nature. In this paper, we emphasised our work on age range estimation with four pre-defined classes. We applied a fast and efficient machine learning method: extreme learning machines, to solve the age categorization problem. Local Gabor Binary Patterns, Biologically Inspired Feature and Gabor were adopted to represent face image. Age estimation was performed on three different aging datasets and experimental results are reported to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness. "}

In the main ensemble of ESOS-ELM, each OS-ELM network is trained with a balanced subset of the data stream. Using \{ELM\} theory, a computationally efficient storage scheme is proposed to leverage the prior knowledge of recurring concepts. A distinctive feature of ESOS-ELM is that it can learn from new samples sequentially in both the chunk-by-chunk and one-by-one modes. ESOS-ELM can also be effectively applied to imbalanced data without concept drift. On most of the datasets used in our experiments, ESOS-ELM performs better than the state-of-the-art methods for both stationary and non-stationary environments. "}

Based on the physics based model, a simple but effective low order model is obtained using the Karhunen–Loeve decomposition method. The corresponding uncertain chemical related heat generation term in the low order model is approximated using extreme learning machine. All uncertain parameters in the low order model can be determined analytically in a linear way. Finally, the temperature distribution of the whole battery can be estimated in real time based on the identified low order model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The simple training process of the model makes it superior for onboard application. "}

However, when facing learning problems with multi-dimensional outputs, named multi-dimensional regression, the conventional \{ELMs\} could not generally get satisfactory results because it is incapable of exploiting the relatedness among outputs efficiently. To solve this problem, a new regularized \{ELM\} is firstly proposed in this paper by introducing a hyper-spherical loss function as regularizer. As the regularization form with this loss function cannot be solved directly, an solution with iterative procedure is presented. For improving the learning performance, the algorithm proposed above is further reformulated to identify the inner grouping structure hidden in outputs by assuming that the grouping structure is determined by different linear combinations of a small number of latent basis neurons. This is achieved as a mixed integer programming, and finally an alternating minimization method is presented to solve this problem. Experiments on two multi-dimensional data sets, a toy problem and a real-life dynamical cylindrical vibration data set, are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

abstract = {"AbstractObjective The objective of this paper is to highlight the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques in computational docking. The use of smart computational methods in the life cycle of drug design is relatively a recent development that has gained much popularity and interest over the last few years. Central to this methodology is the notion of computational docking which is the process of predicting the best pose (orientation + conformation) of a small molecule (drug candidate) when bound to a target larger receptor molecule (protein) in order to form a stable complex molecule. In computational docking, a large number of binding poses are evaluated and ranked using a scoring function. The scoring function is a mathematical predictive model that produces a score that represents the binding free energy, and hence the stability, of the resulting complex molecule. Generally, such a function should produce a set of plausible ligands ranked according to their binding stability along with their binding poses. In more practical terms, an effective scoring function should produce promising drug candidates which can then be synthesized and physically screened using high throughput screening process. Therefore, the key to computer-aided drug design is the design of an efficient highly accurate scoring function (using \{ML\} techniques). Methods The methods presented in this paper are specifically based on \{ML\} techniques. Despite many traditional techniques have been proposed, the performance was generally poor. Only in the last few years started the application of the \{ML\} technology in the design of scoring functions; and the results have been very promising. Material The ML-based techniques are based on various molecular features extracted from the abundance of protein–ligand information in the public molecular databases, e.g., protein data bank bind (PDBbind). Results In this paper, we present this paradigm shift elaborating on the main constituent elements of the \{ML\} approach to molecular docking along with the state-of-the-art research in this area. For instance, the best random forest (RF)-based scoring function [35] on \{PDBbind\} v2007 achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and experimentally determined binding affinities of 0.803 while the best conventional scoring function achieves 0.644 [34]. The best RF-based ranking power [6] ranks the ligands correctly based on their experimentally determined binding affinities with accuracy 62.5% and identifies the top binding ligand with accuracy 78.1%. Conclusions We conclude with open questions and potential future research directions that can be pursued in smart computational docking; using molecular features of different nature (geometrical, energy terms, pharmacophore), advanced \{ML\} techniques (e.g., deep learning), combining more than one \{ML\} models.

Provided that the required therapy would not be the same, an erroneous detection might lead to serious injuries to the patient or even cause Ventricular Fibrillation (VF). The main novelty of this paper is the use of time-frequency (t-f) representation images as the direct input to the classifier. We hypothesize that this method allow to improve classification results as it allows to eliminate the typical feature selection and extraction stage, and its corresponding loss of information. Methods The standard \{AHA\} and MIT-BIH databases were used for evaluation and comparison with other authors. Previous to t-f Pseudo Wigner-Ville (PWV) calculation, only a basic preprocessing for denoising and signal alignment is necessary. In order to check the validity of the method independently of the classifier, four different classifiers are used: Logistic Regression with \{L2\} Regularization (L2 RLR), Adaptive Neural Network Classifier (ANNC), Support Vector Machine (SSVM), and Bagging classifier (BAGG). Results The main classification results for \{VF\} detection (including flutter episodes) are 95.56% sensitivity and 98.8% specificity, 88.80% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity for ventricular tachycardia (VT), 98.98% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity for normal sinus, and 96.87% sensitivity and 99.55% specificity for other rhythms. Conclusion Results shows that using t-f data representations to feed classifiers provide superior performance values than the feature selection strategies used in previous works.

abstract = {"Abstract Graph patterns are widely used to define the feature space for building an efficient graph classification model. Synergy graph patterns refer to those graphs, where the relationships among the nodes are highly inseparable. Compared with the general graph patterns, synergy graph patterns which have much higher discriminative powers are more suitable as the classification features. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a simple and efficient Single-hidden Layer Feedforward neural Networks (SLFNs) algorithm with extremely fast learning capacity. In this paper we propose the problem of extending \{ELM\} to non-redundant synergy pattern based graph classification. The graph classification framework being widely used consists of two steps, namely feature generation and classification. The first issue is how to quickly obtain significant graph pattern features from a graph database. The next step is how to effectively build a graph classification model with these graph pattern features. An efficient depth-first algorithm, called GINS, was presented to find all non-redundant synergy graph patterns. Also, based on the proposed Support Graph Vector Model (SGVM) and \{ELM\} algorithm, the graph classification model was constructed. Extensive experiments are conducted on a series of real-life datasets. The results show that \{GINS\} is more efficient than two representative competitors. Besides, when the generated graph patterns are considered as the classification features, the GINS+ELM classification accuracy can be improved much. "}

A new biodiesel engine modeling and optimization framework based on extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed. As an accurate model is required for effective optimization result, kernel-based \{ELM\} (K-ELM) is used instead of basic \{ELM\} because K-ELM can provide better generalization performance, and the randomness of basic \{ELM\} does not occur in K-ELM. By using K-ELM, a biodiesel engine model is first created based on experimental data. Logarithmic transformation of dependent variables is used to alleviate the problems of data scarcity and data exponentiality simultaneously. With the K-ELM engine model, cuckoo search (CS) is then employed to determine the optimal biodiesel ratio. A flexible objective function is designed so that various user-defined constraints can be applied. As an illustrative study, the fuel price in Macau is used to perform the optimization. To verify the modeling and optimization framework, the K-ELM model is compared with a least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) model, and the \{CS\} optimization result is compared with particle swarm optimization and experimental results. The evaluation result shows that K-ELM can achieve comparable performance to LS-SVM, resulting in a reliable prediction result for optimization. It also shows that the optimization results based on \{CS\} is effective. "}

abstract = {"Abstract The dawn of a new era in knowledge management due to information explosion is making old habits of modeling knowledge and decision-making inadequate. In the search for new modeling paradigms, we expect ontologies to play a big role. One of the critical challenges we face is the scarcity of semantically rich, properly populated, ontologies in most application domains in chemical and materials engineering. Developing such ontologies is a very challenging task requiring considerable investment in time, effort, and expert knowledge. One needs automation tools that can assist an ontology engineer to quickly develop and curate domain-specific ontologies. We consider our conceptual framework in this paper, a general approach for populating scientific ontologies, and its implementation as the prototype HOLMES, as an early attempt towards such an automated knowledge management environment. Our approach integrates a variety of machine learning and natural language processing methods to extract information from journal articles and store them semantically in an ontology. In this work, identification of key terms (such as chemicals, drugs, processes, anatomical entities, etc.) from abstracts, and the classification of these terms into 25 classes are presented. Two methods, a multi-class classifier (SVM) and a multi-label classifier (HOMER), were tested on an annotated data set for the pharmaceutical industry. The test was done using two different versions of the same data set, one using the \{BIO\} notation and the other not. The \{F1\} scores for HOMER, were better in the \{BIO\} notation (63.6% vs 48.5%) while \{SVM\} performed better in the non-BIO version (54.1% vs 53.2%). However, the standard metrics did not consider the effect of the multiple answers that the multi-label classifier is allowed to obtain. As the results of our computational experiments show, while the performance of multi-label classifier is encouraging, much more remains to be done in order to develop a practically viable automated ontology-based knowledge management system.

The proposed smile detector is tested with different feature descriptors on publicly available databases including real-world face images.

It is crucial that the used cluster algorithm works correctly. However, by imposing a predefined shape on the clusters, classical algorithms occasionally suggest a cluster structure in homogenously distributed data or assign data points to incorrect clusters. We analyzed whether this can be avoided by using emergent self-organizing feature maps (ESOM). Methods Data sets with different degrees of complexity were submitted to \{ESOM\} analysis with large numbers of neurons, using an interactive R-based bioinformatics tool. On top of the trained \{ESOM\} the distance structure in the high dimensional feature space was visualized in the form of a so-called U-matrix. Clustering results were compared with those provided by classical common cluster algorithms including single linkage, Ward and k-means. Results Ward clustering imposed cluster structures on cluster-less “golf ball”, “cuboid” and “S-shaped” data sets that contained no structure at all (random data). Ward clustering also imposed structures on permuted real world data sets. By contrast, the ESOM/U-matrix approach correctly found that these data contain no cluster structure. However, ESOM/U-matrix was correct in identifying clusters in biomedical data truly containing subgroups. It was always correct in cluster structure identification in further canonical artificial data. Using intentionally simple data sets, it is shown that popular clustering algorithms typically used for biomedical data sets may fail to cluster data correctly, suggesting that they are also likely to perform erroneously on high dimensional biomedical data. Conclusions The present analyses emphasized that generally established classical hierarchical clustering algorithms carry a considerable tendency to produce erroneous results. By contrast, unsupervised machine-learned analysis of cluster structures, applied using the ESOM/U-matrix method, is a viable, unbiased method to identify true clusters in the high-dimensional space of complex data.

Hospitals are increasingly relying on clinical decision support systems to assist in the demanding prescription reviewing process. In previous work, we have reported on an emerging clinical decision support system for antimicrobial stewardship that can learn new rules supervised by user feedback. In this paper, we report on the evaluation of this system. Methods The evaluated system uses a knowledge base coupled with a supervised learning module that extracts classification rules for inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions using past recommendations for dose and dosing frequency adjustments, discontinuation of therapy, early switch from intravenous to oral therapy, and redundant antimicrobial spectrum. Over five weeks, the learning module was deployed alongside the baseline system to prospectively evaluate its ability to discover rules that complement the existing knowledge base for identifying inappropriate prescriptions of piperacillin–tazobactam, a frequently used antimicrobial. Results The antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists reviewed 374 prescriptions, of which 209 (56% of 374) were identified as inappropriate leading to 43 recommendations to optimize prescriptions. The baseline system combined with the learning module triggered alerts in 270 prescriptions with a positive predictive value of identifying inappropriate prescriptions of 74%. Of these, 240 reviewed prescriptions were identified by the alerts of the baseline system with a positive predictive value of 82% and 105 reviewed prescriptions were identified by the alerts of the learning module with a positive predictive value of 62%. The combined system triggered alerts for all 43 recommendations, resulting in a rate of actionable alerts of 16% (43 recommendations of 270 reviewed alerts); the baseline system triggered alerts for 38 interventions, resulting in a rate of actionable alerts of 16% (38 of 240 reviewed alerts); and the learning module triggered alerts for 17 interventions, resulting in a rate of actionable alerts of 16% (17 of 105 reviewed alerts). The learning module triggered alerts for every inappropriate prescription missed by the knowledge base of the baseline system (n = 5). Conclusions The learning module was able to extract clinically relevant rules for multiple types of antimicrobial alerts. The learned rules were shown to extend the knowledge base of the baseline system by identifying pharmacist interventions that were missed by the baseline system. The learned rules identified inappropriate prescribing practices that were not supported by local experts and were missing from its knowledge base. However, combining the baseline system and the learning module increased the number of false positives. "}

The current methods can usually be applied only to small datasets with a dozen or so different actions, and the systems often require large amounts of time to train the models and to classify new sequences. In this paper, we first extract simple but effective frame-level features from the skeletal data and build a recognition system based on the extreme learning machine. We then propose three modeling methods for post-processing the classification outputs to obtain the recognition results on the action sequence level. We test the proposed method on three public datasets ranging from 11 to 40 action classes. For all datasets, the method can classify the sequences with accuracies reaching 96–99% and with the average classification time for one sequence on a single computer core around 4 ms. Fast training and testing and the high accuracy make the proposed method readily applicable for online recognition applications. "}

Different with most of greedy-algorithms based model selection approaches, by using ℓ 2 , 1 -norm, \{S3ELM\} casts a joint sparse constraints on the training model of \{ELM\} and formulate a convex programming. Moreover, with a Laplacian, \{S3ELM\} can make full use of the information from both the labeled and unlabeled samples.

To use different blends of biofuels, the electronic control unit (ECU) of the engine must be modified and calibrated. However, the calibration process of \{ECU\} is very costly and time-consuming. Therefore, most of the engines can only use one specific biofuel blend; otherwise the engines cannot run properly. To alleviate this problem, a mathematical engine model can be used for predicting the engine performance at different \{ECU\} settings and biofuel blends so that the \{ECU\} can be re-calibrated in real-time via some controllers. The prediction of the engine model must be very fast and accurate for such online control purpose. It must also be very compact due to the limited memory size of the ECU. As a result, a new method called sparse Bayesian extreme learning machine (SBELM) is proposed in this paper to fulfill these requirements of the mathematical engine model for fast engine performance prediction and \{ECU\} online re-calibration. Experiments were conducted to compare \{SBELM\} with conventional ELM, Bayesian \{ELM\} (BELM) and back-propagated neural network (BPNN). Evaluation results show that \{SBELM\} can perform at least similar to, but mostly better than, ELM, \{BELM\} and BPNN, in terms of prediction accuracy. In terms of execution time, model size, and insensitivity to hidden neuron number, \{SBELM\} completely outperforms the other three methods. By these results, \{SBELM\} is verified to better fulfill the practical requirements of mathematical engine model for online engine performance prediction. "}

On one hand, it not only deals with the soft class probability outputs but also refines the weights from classifiers to classes. On the other hand, the class-specific weights can be used to improve the combinative performance without increasing much computational load. This paper proposes two weight optimization based ensemble methods (CSSV-ELM and SpaCSSV-ELM) under the framework of \{CSSV\} scheme for multiple extreme learning machines (ELMs). The designed two models are in terms of accuracy and sparsity aspects, respectively. Firstly, CSSV-ELM takes advantage of the condition number of matrix, which reveals the stability of linear equation, to determine the weights of base \{ELM\} classifiers. This model can reduce the unreliability induced by randomly input parameters of a single ELM, and solve the ill-conditioned problem caused by linear system structure of \{ELM\} simultaneously. Secondly, sparse ensemble methods can lower memory requirement and speed up the classification process, but only for classifier-specific weight level. Therefore, a SpaCSSV-ELM method is proposed by transforming the weight optimization problem to a sparse coding problem, which uses the sparse representation technique for maintaining classification performance with less nonzero weight coefficients. Experiments are carried out on twenty \{UCI\} data sets and Finance event series data and the experimental results show the superior performance of the \{CSSV\} based \{ELM\} algorithms by comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

However, OS-ELM may be affected by an improper number of hidden nodes settings which reduces the generalization of OS-ELM. This paper addresses this problem in OS-ELM. A new structural tolerance OS-ELM (STOS-ELM), based on the Householder block exact inverse \{QRD\} recursive least squares algorithm having numerical robustness is proposed. Experimental results conducted on four regressions and five classification problems showed that STOS-ELM can handle the situation when the network is constructed with an improper number of hidden nodes. Accordingly, the proposed STOS-ELM can be easily applied; the size of the hidden layer of \{ELM\} can be roughly approximated. If a chunk of data is received, it can be updated in the existing network without having to worry about the proper number of given hidden nodes. Furthermore, the accuracy of the network trained by STOS-ELM is comparable to that of the batch \{ELM\} when the networks have the same configurations. STOS-ELM can also be applied in ensemble version (ESTOS-ELM). We found that the stability of STOS-ELM can be further improved using the ensemble technique. The results show that ESTOS-ELM is also more stable and accurate than both of the original OS-ELM and EOS-ELM, especially in the classification problems. "}

In recent years, many machine learning techniques [e.g., artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been successfully applied to CCPR. However, such existing research for \{CCPR\} has mostly been developed for identification of basic CCPs. Little attention has been given to the utilization of ANNs/SVMs for identification of concurrent \{CCPs\} (two or more basic \{CCPs\} occurring simultaneously) which are commonly encountered in practical manufacturing processes. In addition, these existing research for \{CCPR\} cannot provide more detailed \{CCP\} parameter information, such as shift magnitude, trend slope, cycle amplitude, etc., which is very useful for quality practitioners to search the assignable causes that give rise to the out-of-control situation. This study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) with extreme learning machine (ELM) to identify typical concurrent \{CCPs\} and in addition to accurately quantify the major \{CCP\} parameter of the specific basic \{CCPs\} involved. The numerical results indicate that the proposed model can effectively identify not only concurrent \{CCPs\} but also basic CCPs. Meanwhile, the major \{CCP\} parameter of the identified concurrent \{CCP\} can also be accurately quantified. "}

The parameters of the \{SLFNs\} are modified using the recently proposed neural algorithm named extreme learning machine (ELM), where the parameters of the hidden nodes are assigned randomly. Different from the original \{ELM\} algorithm, the output weights are updated using the adaptive laws derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem and Barbalat׳s lemma so that the asymptotical stability of the system can be guaranteed. The robustifying control term is also constructed to compensate for approximation errors of the SLFNs. In order to avoid the requirement of the approximation error bounds, the estimation laws derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem and Barbalat׳s lemma are employed to estimate the error bounds in the second adaptive control scheme. Finally the proposed control schemes are applied to control a two-link robot manipulator.

The motivation behind this approach is that these features will be from very different subspaces and therefore each neuron extracts more diverse information from the inputs than neurons with completely random features traditionally used in ELM. Therefore, ideally it should lead to better ELMs. Experiments show that indeed \{ELMs\} with ternary weights generally achieve lower test error. Furthermore, the experiments show that the Binary and Ternary \{ELMs\} are more robust to irrelevant and noisy variables and are in fact performing implicit variable selection. Finally, since only the weight generation scheme is adapted, the computational time of the \{ELM\} is unaffected, and the improved accuracy, added robustness and the implicit variable selection of Binary \{ELM\} and Ternary \{ELM\} come for free.

The approach assumes that we have available only a small training set of labeled samples, which we enrich with a set of guessed labelings on selected samples from the vast pool of unlabeled image pixels. Selection and label guessing is conditioned to an unsupervised classification of the image pixel spectra, and to the spatial proximity to the labeled samples in the image domain. Unlabeled pixels falling in the spatial neighborhood of a labeled training sample, and belonging to the same unsupervised class, acquire its label. Unsupervised classification can be performed by any clustering technique, in this paper we have resorted to the classical K-means. The classifier built from the enriched training dataset is applied to the entire hyperspectral image. Finally, we perform a spatial regularization of the classification label image, maximizing a rather general prior smoothness criterion, by the selection of the most frequent class in each pixel neighborhood. This paper reports experiments with homogeneous ensembles of ELM, rELM, and OP-ELM classifiers, including a sensitivity analysis over the ensemble size and the number of hidden nodes.

Learning tasks are modeled in the general framework of multi-objective optimization, where a set of constraints must be satisfied in addition to the traditional smoothness regularization term. The constraints translate First Order Logic formulas, which can express learning-from-example supervisions and general prior knowledge about the environment by using fuzzy logic. By enforcing the constraints also on the test set, this paper presents a natural extension of the framework to perform collective classification. Interestingly, the theory holds for both the case of data represented by feature vectors and the case of data simply expressed by pattern identifiers, thus extending classic kernel machines and graph regularization, respectively. This paper also proposes a probabilistic interpretation of the proposed learning scheme, and highlights intriguing connections with probabilistic approaches like Markov Logic Networks. Experimental results on classic benchmarks provide clear evidence of the remarkable improvements that are obtained with respect to related approaches. "}

While modern manufacturing systems and machines have always contributed towards better control of surface quality, better computational facilities and the availability of newer algorithms attract researchers to understand the prediction of quality in a better manner. In this paper, prediction of surface roughness by multiple regression analysis is presented. The predictors are cutting parameters, tool wear and the statistical parameters extracted from the vibration signals of a turning centre. The contribution of various statistical parameters in prediction of surface roughness is studied. A Machine learning approach using feature reduction using principle component analysis is attempted to achieve higher predictability and low computational effort. "}

Traditional methods involve plenty of pre-processing steps, like model construction, feature extraction, etc. Moreover, these methods are only effective for some specific dataset. In this paper, we propose to use local receptive fields based extreme learning machine (ELM-LRF) as a general framework for object recognition. It is operated directly on the raw images and thus suitable for all different datasets. Additionally, the architecture is simple and only requires few computations, as most connection weights are randomly generated. Comparing to state-of-the-art results on NORB, ETH-80 and \{COIL\} datasets, it is on par with the best one on ETH-80 and sets the new records for \{NORB\} and COIL. "}

While there exist learning style questionnaires for identifying a student's learning style, such questionnaires have several disadvantages and therefore, research has been conducted on automatically identifying learning styles from students’ behavior in a learning environment. Current approaches to automatically identify learning styles have an average precision between 66% and 77%, which shows the need for improvements in order to use such automatic approaches reliably in learning environments. In this paper, four computational intelligence algorithms (artificial neural network, genetic algorithm, ant colony system and particle swarm optimization) have been investigated with respect to their potential to improve the precision of automatic learning style identification. Each algorithm was evaluated with data from 75 students. The artificial neural network shows the most promising results with an average precision of 80.7%, followed by particle swarm optimization with an average precision of 79.1%. Improving the precision of automatic learning style identification allows more students to benefit from more accurate information about their learning styles as well as more accurate personalization towards accommodating their learning styles in a learning environment.

abstract = {"AbstractObjective Electronic health records (EHR) offer medical and pharmacogenomics research unprecedented opportunities to identify and classify patients at risk. \{EHRs\} are collections of highly inter-dependent records that include biological, anatomical, physiological, and behavioral observations. They comprise a patient’s clinical phenome, where each patient has thousands of date-stamped records distributed across many relational tables. Development of \{EHR\} computer-based phenotyping algorithms require time and medical insight from clinical experts, who most often can only review a small patient subset representative of the total \{EHR\} records, to identify phenotype features. In this research we evaluate whether relational machine learning (ML) using inductive logic programming (ILP) can contribute to addressing these issues as a viable approach for EHR-based phenotyping. Methods Two relational learning \{ILP\} approaches and three well-known \{WEKA\} (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) implementations of non-relational approaches (PART, J48, and JRIP) were used to develop models for nine phenotypes. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coded \{EHR\} data were used to select training cohorts for the development of each phenotypic model. Accuracy, precision, recall, F-Measure, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve statistics were measured for each phenotypic model based on independent manually verified test cohorts. A two-sided binomial distribution test (sign test) compared the five \{ML\} approaches across phenotypes for statistical significance. Results We developed an approach to automatically label training examples using ICD-9 diagnosis codes for the \{ML\} approaches being evaluated. Nine phenotypic models for each \{ML\} approach were evaluated, resulting in better overall model performance in \{AUROC\} using \{ILP\} when compared to \{PART\} (p = 0.039), \{J48\} (p = 0.003) and \{JRIP\} (p = 0.003). Discussion \{ILP\} has the potential to improve phenotyping by independently delivering clinically expert interpretable rules for phenotype definitions, or intuitive phenotypes to assist experts. Conclusion Relational learning using \{ILP\} offers a viable approach to EHR-driven phenotyping. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the effective treatment of AD, it would be important to identify \{MCI\} patients at high risk for conversion to AD. In this study, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion from one to three years before the clinical diagnosis. First, we developed a novel \{MRI\} biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion using semi-supervised learning and then integrated it with age and cognitive measures about the subjects using a supervised learning algorithm resulting in what we call the aggregate biomarker. The novel characteristics of the methods for learning the biomarkers are as follows: 1) We used a semi-supervised learning method (low density separation) for the construction of \{MRI\} biomarker as opposed to more typical supervised methods; 2) We performed a feature selection on \{MRI\} data from \{AD\} subjects and normal controls without using data from \{MCI\} subjects via regularized logistic regression; 3) We removed the aging effects from the \{MRI\} data before the classifier training to prevent possible confounding between \{AD\} and age related atrophies; and 4) We constructed the aggregate biomarker by first learning a separate \{MRI\} biomarker and then combining it with age and cognitive measures about the \{MCI\} subjects at the baseline by applying a random forest classifier. We experimentally demonstrated the added value of these novel characteristics in predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion on data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. With the \{ADNI\} data, the \{MRI\} biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7661 in discriminating progressive \{MCI\} patients (pMCI) from stable \{MCI\} patients (sMCI). Our aggregate biomarker based on \{MRI\} data together with baseline cognitive measurements and age achieved a 10-fold cross-validated \{AUC\} score of 0.9020 in discriminating pMCI from sMCI. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of the suggested approach for early \{AD\} diagnosis and an important role of \{MRI\} in the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. However, it is evident based on our results that combining \{MRI\} data with cognitive test results improved the accuracy of the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. "}

As in all eddy covariance studies, obtaining annual sums of urban \{CO2\} exchange requires imputation of data gaps due to low turbulence and non-stationary conditions, adverse weather, and instrument failures. Gap-filling approaches that are widely used for measurements from towers in natural vegetation are based on light and temperature response models. However, they do not account for key features of the urban environment including tower footprint heterogeneity and localized \{CO2\} sources. Here, we present a novel gap-filling modeling framework that uses machine learning to select explanatory variables, such as continuous traffic counts and temporal variables, and then constrains models separately for spatially classified subsets of the data. We applied the modeling framework to a three year time series of measurements from a tall broadcast tower in a suburban neighborhood of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA. The gap-filling performance was similar to that reported for natural measurement sites, explaining 64% to 88% of the variability in the fluxes. Simulated carbon budgets were in good agreement with an ecophysiological bottom-up study at the same site. Total annual carbon dioxide flux sums for the tower site ranged from 1064 to 1382 g C m−2 yr−1, across different years and different gap-filling methods. Bias errors of annual sums resulting from gap-filling did not exceed 18 g C m−2 yr−1 and random uncertainties did not exceed ±44 g C m−2 yr−1 (or ±3.8% of the annual flux). Regardless of the gap-filling method used, the year-to-year differences in carbon exchange at this site were small. In contrast, the modeled annual sums of \{CO2\} exchange differed by a factor of two depending on wind direction. This indicated that the modeled time series captured the spatial variability in both the biogenic and anthropogenic \{CO2\} sources and sinks in a reproducible way. The gap-filling approach developed here may also be useful for inhomogeneous sites other than urban areas, such as logged forests or ecosystems under disturbance from fire or pests. "}

In this paper and its companion one, we will focus on the issue of kernel structure design. Depending on the type of the prior knowledge, we provide two different ways: from a machine learning perspective or from a system theory perspective. We will focus on the first perspective here. In particular, we show that both the stable spline kernel and the diagonal correlated kernel belong to the class of the so-called exponentially convex locally stationary (ECLS) kernels. This finding motivates to construct \{ECLS\} or \{LS\} kernels for this regularization method in different ways, e.g., based on carefully designed state space models. "}

The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of \{ML\} tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of \{ML\} methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent \{ML\} approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised \{ML\} techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of \{ML\} methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.

The method relies on simultaneously filtering and classifying pixels within the image. The diffusion term smooths the patches within the image, and the reaction term tends to move the pixel values towards the closest (in the sense of stochastic distances) representative class. We present a detailed study of the method accuracy using both simulated and true data, and we provide optimum parameters for its use. We show that the proposed method outperforms the results obtained using maximum likelihood and usual stochastic distance classification methods. "}

To improve prediction accuracy using each model’s unique features, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines the wavelet transform, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) based on self-adapting particle swarm optimization and an auto regressive moving average (ARMA). Self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) is adopted to search for the optimal kernel parameters of the KELM. After testing the wavelet decomposition components, stationary series as new input sets are predicted by the \{ARMA\} model and non-stationary series are predicted by the SAPSO-KELM model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using electricity price data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), Australian and Spanish markets. The experimental results show that the developed method has more accurate prediction, better generality and practicability than individual methods and other hybrid methods. "}

Extracting craters is one of the fundamental tasks in planetary research. Although many automated crater detection algorithms have been developed to exact craters from image or topographic data, most of them are applicable only in particular regions, and only a few can be widely used, especially in complex surface settings. In this study, we present a machine learning approach to crater detection from topographic data. This approach includes two steps: detecting square regions which contain one crater with the use of a boosting algorithm and delineating the rims of the crater in each square region by local terrain analysis and circular Hough transform. A new variant of Haar-like features (scaled Haar-like features) is proposed and combined with traditional Haar-like features and local binary pattern features to enhance the performance of the classifier. Experimental results with the use of Mars topographic data demonstrate that the developed approach can significantly decrease the false positive detection rate while maintaining a relatively high true positive detection rate even in challenging sites.

This paper introduces an approach to classify 54 countries (in 2007–2009) according to their progress toward a knowledge economy (KE). To achieve this, the aims of this paper are twofold: first, to find clusters of countries at a similar stage of development toward \{KE\} to test if they are meaningful; hence, it will be possible to order the clusters from early \{KEs\} (last cluster) to advanced \{KEs\} (first cluster). Second, having obtained these clusters, it is possible to build various models to detect the advancement of countries toward \{KE\} from one year to another due to its classification. Then, three ordinal classifiers from the machine-learning field were compared in order to select the classifier that performs the best and to confirm the ordinal description of the clusters. Finally, an ordinal model based on the Support Vector Ordinal Regression with Implicit Constraints was selected because of its ability to classify the patterns into the clusters, confirming the appropriateness of the clusters and their ordinal nature. The proposed ordinal classifier could be used for monitoring the progress or stage of transition to \{KE\} and for analysing whether a country changes clusters, entering one that performs better or worse.

The \{ML\} algorithm can mimic characteristics of preoperative treatment plans deemed clinically acceptable by brachytherapists. The planning efficiency, dosimetry, and quality (as assessed by experts) of preoperative plans generated with an \{ML\} planning approach was retrospectively evaluated in this study. Methods and Materials Preimplantation and postimplantation treatment plans were extracted from 100 high-quality \{LDR\} treatments and stored within a training database. The \{ML\} training algorithm matches similar features from a new \{LDR\} case to those within the training database to rapidly obtain an initial seed distribution; plans were then further fine-tuned using stochastic optimization. Preimplantation treatment plans generated by the \{ML\} algorithm were compared with brachytherapist (BT) treatment plans in terms of planning time (Wilcoxon rank sum, α = 0.05) and dosimetry (1-way analysis of variance, α = 0.05). Qualitative preimplantation plan quality was evaluated by expert \{LDR\} radiation oncologists using a Likert scale questionnaire. Results The average planning time for the \{ML\} approach was 0.84 ± 0.57 minutes, compared with 17.88 ± 8.76 minutes for the expert planner (P=.020). Preimplantation plans were dosimetrically equivalent to the \{BT\} plans; the average prostate V150% was 4% lower for \{ML\} plans (P=.002), although the difference was not clinically significant. Respondents ranked the ML-generated plans as equivalent to expert \{BT\} treatment plans in terms of target coverage, normal tissue avoidance, implant confidence, and the need for plan modifications. Respondents had difficulty differentiating between plans generated by a human or those generated by the \{ML\} algorithm. Conclusions Prostate \{LDR\} preimplantation treatment plans that have equivalent quality to plans created by brachytherapists can be rapidly generated using ML. The adoption of \{ML\} in the brachytherapy workflow is expected to improve \{LDR\} treatment plan uniformity while reducing planning time and resources. "}

However, the majority of the literature is centered on continuous problems with a single optimization objective. There are still a lot of problems to be handled for multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine-learning based multi-objective memetic algorithm (ML-MOMA) for the discrete permutation flowshop scheduling problem. There are two main features in the proposed ML-MOMA. First, each solution is assigned with an individual archive to store the non-dominated solutions found by it and based on these individual archives a new population update method is presented. Second, an adaptive multi-objective local search is developed, in which the analysis of historical data accumulated during the search process is used to adaptively determine which non-dominated solutions should be selected for local search and how the local search should be applied. Computational results based on benchmark problems show that the cooperation of the above two features can help to achieve a balance between evolutionary global search and local search. In addition, many of the best known Pareto fronts for these benchmark problems in the literature can be improved by the proposed ML-MOMA. "}

Often enough, accurate predictive models (e.g. simulators) can be devised, but they are too complex or too slow to be employed in combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we propose a methodology called Empirical Model Learning (EML) that relies on Machine Learning for obtaining components of a prescriptive model, using data either extracted from a predictive model or harvested from a real system. In a way, \{EML\} can be considered as a technique to merge predictive and prescriptive analytics. All models introduce some form of approximation. Citing G.E.P.

In EML, models are useful if they provide adequate accuracy, and if they can be effectively exploited by solvers for finding high-quality solutions.

We use two learning methods, namely Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Trees and we show how to encapsulate the learned model in a number of optimization techniques, namely Local Search, Constraint Programming, Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming and \{SAT\} Modulo Theories.

Even when restricted to images in specific domains such as music score recognition, solving image processing problems usually requires the design of customized algorithms. To cope with image variabilities and the growing amount of data, machine learning based techniques emerge as a natural approach to be employed in image processing problems. In this sense, image operator learning methods are concerned with estimating, from sample pairs of input-output images of a transformation, a local function that characterizes the image transformation. These methods require the definition of some parameters, including the local information to be considered in the processing which is defined by a window. In this work we show how to apply the image operator learning technique to the staff line removal problem. We present an algorithm for window determination and show that it captures visual information relevant for staff removal. We also present a reference window set to be used in cases where the training set is not sufficiently large. Experimental results obtained with respect to synthetic and handwritten music scores under varying image conditions show that the learned image operators are comparable with especially designed state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms.

abstract = {"Abstract There is broad interest in predicting the clinical course of mental disorders from early, multimodal clinical and biological information. Current computational models, however, constitute a significant barrier to realizing this goal. The early identification of trauma survivors at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is plausible given the disorder's salient onset and the abundance of putative biological and clinical risk indicators. This work evaluates the ability of Machine Learning (ML) forecasting approaches to identify and integrate a panel of unique predictive characteristics and determine their accuracy in forecasting non-remitting \{PTSD\} from information collected within10 days of a traumatic event. Data on event characteristics, emergency department observations, and early symptoms were collected in 957 trauma survivors, followed for fifteen months. An \{ML\} feature selection algorithm identified a set of predictors that rendered all others redundant. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as other \{ML\} classification algorithms were used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of i) \{ML\} selected features, ii) all available features without selection, and iii) Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) symptoms alone. \{SVM\} also compared the prediction of a) \{PTSD\} diagnostic status at 15 months to b) posterior probability of membership in an empirically derived non-remitting \{PTSD\} symptom trajectory. Results are expressed as mean Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). The feature selection algorithm identified 16 predictors, present in ≥95% cross-validation trials. The accuracy of predicting non-remitting \{PTSD\} from that set (AUC = .77) did not differ from predicting from all available information (AUC = .78). Predicting from \{ASD\} symptoms was not better then chance (AUC = .60). The prediction of \{PTSD\} status was less accurate than that of membership in a non-remitting trajectory (AUC = .71). \{ML\} methods may fill a critical gap in forecasting PTSD. The ability to identify and integrate unique risk indicators makes this a promising approach for developing algorithms that infer probabilistic risk of chronic posttraumatic stress psychopathology based on complex sources of biological, psychological, and social information.

Two different types of \{THz\} spectra are considered in the classification process. Firstly a binary classification study of poly-A and poly-C ribonucleic acid samples is performed. This is then contrasted with a difficult multi-class classification problem of spectra from six different powder samples that although have fairly indistinguishable features in the optical spectrum, they also possess a few discernable spectral features in the terahertz part of the spectrum. Classification is performed using a complex-valued extreme learning machine algorithm that takes into account features in both the amplitude as well as the phase of the recorded spectra. Classification speed and accuracy are contrasted with that achieved using a support vector machine classifier. The study systematically compares the classifier performance achieved after adopting different Gaussian kernels when separating amplitude and phase signatures. The two signatures are presented as feature vectors for both training and testing purposes. The study confirms the utility of complex-valued extreme learning machine algorithms for classification of the very large data sets generated with current terahertz imaging spectrometers. The classifier can take into consideration heterogeneous layers within an object as would be required within a tomographic setting and is sufficiently robust to detect patterns hidden inside noisy terahertz data sets. The proposed study opens up the opportunity for the establishment of complex-valued extreme learning machine algorithms as new chemometric tools that will assist the wider proliferation of terahertz sensing technology for chemical sensing, quality control, security screening and clinic diagnosis. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm should also be very useful in other applications requiring the classification of very large datasets. "}

abstract = {"Abstract In recent years, there has been significant growth in the use of online learning resources by learners. However, due to information overload, many learners are experiencing difficulties in retrieving useful and relevant learning resources that meet their learning needs. Although existing recommender systems have recorded significant success in e-commerce domain, they still experience drawbacks in making accurate recommendations of learning resources in e-learning domain due to differences in learner characteristics such as learning style, knowledge level as well as learners’ sequential learning patterns. Most of the existing recommendation techniques do not consider differences in learner characteristics. This problem can be alleviated through incorporation of additional information about the learner into the recommendation process. Furthermore, many recommendation techniques experience cold-start and rating sparsity problems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-based recommender system based on ontology and sequential pattern mining (SPM) for recommendation of e-learning resources to learners. In the proposed recommendation approach, ontology is used to model and represent the domain knowledge about the learner and learning resources whereas \{SPM\} algorithm discovers the learners’ sequential learning patterns. Our approach involves four steps: (1) creating ontology to represent knowledge about the learner and learning resources, (2) computing ratings similarity based on ontology domain knowledge and making predictions for the target learner, (3) generation of top N learning items by the collaborative filtering recommendation engine, and (4) application of \{SPM\} algorithm to the top N learning items to generate the final recommendations for the target learner. A number of experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed hybrid recommender system and results show improved performance. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid approach can alleviate both the cold-start and data sparsity problems by making use of ontological domain knowledge and learner’s sequential access pattern respectively before the initial data to work on is available in the recommender system.

Multi-step time series problem is one of the most challenging problems for machine learning methods. The performance of a prediction model face challenges for higher prediction horizons due to the accumulation of errors. Cooperative coevolution employs in a divide and conquer approach for training neural networks and has been very promising for single step ahead time series prediction. Recently, co-evolutionary multi-task learning has been proposed for dynamic time series prediction. In this paper, we adapt co-evolutionary multi-task learning for multi-step prediction where predictive recurrence is developed to feature knowledge from previous states for future prediction horizon. The goal of the paper is to present a network architecture with predictive recurrence which is capable of multi-step prediction through a form of multi-task learning. We employ cooperative neuro-evolution and an evolutionary algorithm as baselines for comparison. The results show that the proposed method provides the best generalization performance in most cases. Comparison of results with the literature has shown to be promising which motivates further application of the approach for related real-world problems. "}

However, it is unclear how task-relevant neural populations coordinate to explore and consolidate activity patterns. Exploration and consolidation could happen for each neuron independently, across the population jointly, or both. We disambiguated among these possibilities by investigating how subjects learned de novo to control a brain-machine interface using neurons from motor cortex. We decomposed population activity into the sum of private and shared signals, which produce uncorrelated and correlated neural variance, respectively, and examined how these signals’ evolution causally shapes behavior. We found that initially large trial-to-trial movement and private neural variability reduce over learning. Concomitantly, task-relevant shared variance increases, consolidating a manifold containing consistent neural trajectories that generate refined control. These results suggest that motor cortex acquires skillful control by leveraging both independent and coordinated variance to explore and consolidate neural patterns. "}

In general, optimized manufacturing scheduling is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problem. Due to the complexity, scheduling presents a number of challenges to find the best possible solutions. This research proposes an ontology-based framework to formally represent a synchronized, station-based flow shop with a multi-skill workforce and multiple types of machines. Based on the ontology, this research develops a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for the optimal scheduling of a manufacturing system of multi-stage processes for multiple types of products with various machines and a multi-skilled workforce. By employing a learning algorithm, this approach enables real-time cooperation between the workforce and the machines, and adaptively updates production schedules according to dynamically changing real-time events.

Conventional methods, which heavily rely on physical principles, have limited power in practice as their performance is subject to many physical assumptions. By contrast, data-driven methods have gained huge interests due to their flexibility in model development and the rich data available in modern buildings. The rapid development in data science has provided advanced data analytics to tackle prediction problems in a more convenient, efficient and effective way. This paper investigates the potential of one of the most promising techniques in advanced data analytics, i.e., deep learning, in predicting 24-h ahead building cooling load profiles. Deep learning refers to a collection of machine learning algorithms which are powerful in revealing nonlinear and complex patterns in big data. Deep learning can be used either in a supervised manner to develop prediction models with given inputs and output (i.e., cooling load), or in an unsupervised manner to extract meaningful features from raw data as model inputs. This study exploits the potential of deep learning in both manners, and compares its performance in cooling load prediction with typical feature extraction methods and popular prediction techniques in the building field. The results show that deep learning can enhance the performance of building cooling load prediction, especially when used in an unsupervised manner for constructing high-level features as model inputs. Using the features extracted by unsupervised deep learning as inputs for cooling load prediction can evidently enhance the prediction performance. The findings are enlightening and could bring more flexible and effective solutions for building energy predictions. "}

We have previously used computational approaches such as homology modeling and docking to propose 38 \{FDA\} approved drugs for testing and identified several active molecules. To follow on from this, we now describe the in vitro testing of a library of 639 compounds. These data were used to create machine learning models for Mttopo I which were further validated. The combined Mttopo I Bayesian model had a 5 fold cross validation receiver operator characteristic of 0.74 and sensitivity, specificity and concordance values above 0.76 and was used to select commercially available compounds for testing in vitro. The recently described crystal structure of Mttopo I was also compared with the previously described homology model and then used to dock the Mttopo I actives norclomipramine and imipramine. In summary, we describe our efforts to identify small molecule inhibitors of Mttopo I using a combination of machine learning modeling and docking studies in conjunction with screening of the selected molecules for enzyme inhibition. We demonstrate the experimental inhibition of Mttopo I by small molecule inhibitors and show that the enzyme can be readily targeted for lead molecule development. "}

Intrusive memories are key to cognitive behavioural treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, and an aetiological understanding is warranted. We present here analyses using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and a machine learning classifier to investigate whether peri-traumatic brain activation was able to predict later intrusive memories (i.e. before they had happened). To provide a methodological basis for understanding the context of the current results, we first show how functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an experimental analogue of trauma (a trauma film) via a prospective event-related design was able to capture an individual's later intrusive memories. Results showed widespread increases in brain activation at encoding when viewing a scene in the scanner that would later return as an intrusive memory in the real world. These fMRI results were replicated in a second study. While traditional mass univariate regression analysis highlighted an association between brain processing and symptomatology, this is not the same as prediction. Using \{MVPA\} and a machine learning classifier, it was possible to predict later intrusive memories across participants with 68% accuracy, and within a participant with 97% accuracy; i.e. the classifier could identify out of multiple scenes those that would later return as an intrusive memory. We also report here brain networks key in intrusive memory prediction. \{MVPA\} opens the possibility of decoding brain activity to reconstruct idiosyncratic cognitive events with relevance to understanding and predicting mental health symptoms.

Over the visual tree, a tree of multi-task sparse metrics is learned hierarchically by: (a) performing multi-task sparse metric learning over the sibling child nodes under the same parent node to explicitly separate their commonly-shared metric from their node-specific metrics; and (b) propagating the node-specific metric for the parent node to its sibling child nodes (at the next level of the visual tree), so that more discriminative metrics can be learned for controlling inter-level error propagation effectively. We have evaluated our hierarchical multi-task sparse metric learning algorithm over three different image sets and the experimental results demonstrated that our hierarchical multi-task sparse metric learning algorithm can obtain better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms on large-scale image classification.

A total of 13 signal quality metrics were derived from segments of \{ECG\} waveforms, which were labeled by experts. A support vector machine (SVM) was trained to perform the classification and tested on a simulated dataset and was validated using data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB). The simulated training and test datasets were created by selecting clean segments of the \{ECG\} in the 2011 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge database, and adding three types of real \{ECG\} noise at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB). The \{MITDB\} was re-annotated for five levels of signal quality. Different combinations of the 13 metrics were trained and tested on the simulated datasets and the best combination that produced the highest classification accuracy was selected and validated on the MITDB. Performance was assessed using classification accuracy (Ac), and a single class overlap accuracy (OAc), which assumes that an individual type classified into an adjacent class is acceptable. An Ac of 80.26% and an \{OAc\} of 98.60% on the test set were obtained by selecting 10 metrics while 57.26% (Ac) and 94.23% (OAc) were the numbers for the unseen \{MITDB\} validation data without retraining. By performing the fivefold cross validation, an Ac of 88.07 ± 0.32% and \{OAc\} of 99.34 ± 0.07% were gained on the validation fold of MITDB. "}

Firstly, we incorporate a synthesis-linear-classifier-based error term into the basic analysis dictionary learning model, whose classification performance is obviously improved by making full use of the label information. Then, we develop an alternating iterative algorithm to solve the new model and obtain closed-form solutions leading to pretty competitive running efficiency. What is more, we design three classification schemes by fully exploiting the synthesis linear classifier. Finally, extensive comparison experiments on scene categorization, object classification, action recognition and face recognition clearly verify the classification performance of the proposed algorithm.

abstract = {"Abstract Classification rules and rules describing interesting subgroups are important components of descriptive machine learning. Rule learning algorithms typically proceed in two phases: rule refinement selects conditions for specializing the rule, and rule selection selects the final rule among several rule candidates. While most conventional algorithms use the same heuristic for guiding both phases, recent research indicates that the use of two separate heuristics is conceptually better justified, improves the coverage of positive examples, and may result in better classification accuracy. The paper presents and evaluates two new beam search rule learning algorithms: DoubleBeam-SD for subgroup discovery and DoubleBeam-RL for classification rule learning. The algorithms use two separate beams and can combine various heuristics for rule refinement and rule selection, which widens the search space and allows for finding rules with improved quality. In the classification rule learning setting, the experimental results confirm previously shown benefits of using two separate heuristics for rule refinement and rule selection. In subgroup discovery, DoubleBeam-SD algorithm variants outperform several state-of-the-art related algorithms. "}

In this study, several machine learning approaches are used to analyze \{CRS\} data. The analyzed data come from a human blood in vitro assay which was used to assess the potential of mAb-based therapeutics to produce cytokine release similar to that induced by Anti-CD28 superagonistic (Anti-CD28 SA) mAbs. The data contain 7 mAbs and two negative controls, a total of 423 samples coming from 44 donors. Three (3) machine learning approaches were applied in combination to observations obtained from that assay, namely (i) Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA); (ii) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by K-means clustering; and (iii) Decision Tree Classification (DTC). All three approaches were able to identify the treatment that caused the most severe cytokine response. \{HCA\} was able to provide information about the expected number of clusters in the data. \{PCA\} coupled with K-means clustering allowed classification of treatments sample by sample, and visualizing clusters of treatments. \{DTC\} models showed the relative importance of various cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10 to CRS. The use of these approaches in tandem provides better selection of parameters for one method based on outcomes from another, and an overall improved analysis of the data through complementary approaches. Moreover, the \{DTC\} analysis showed in addition that IL-17 may be correlated with \{CRS\} reactions, although this correlation has not yet been corroborated in the literature. "}

Motivated by the superiority of the deep learning approaches for stable feature abstractions in higher levels, an adaptive Stacked Denoising AutoEncoder (SDAE) is developed to tackling such cross-session \{MW\} classification task in which the weights of the shallow hidden neurons could be adaptively updated during the testing procedure. The generalization capability of the adaptive \{SDAE\} is first evaluated under within/cross-session conditions. Then, we compare it with the state of the art \{MW\} classifiers under different feature selection and the noise corruption paradigms. The results indicate a higher performance of the adaptive \{SDAE\} in dealing with the cross-session \{EEG\} features. By analyzing the optimal step length, the data augmentation scheme and the computational cost for iterative tuning, the adaptive \{SDAE\} is also demonstrated to be acceptable for online implementation.

Our study attempts to provides a comprehensive and objective assessment of both the advantages and drawbacks of deep learning algorithms for stock market analysis and prediction. Using high-frequency intraday stock returns as input data, we examine the effects of three unsupervised feature extraction methods—principal component analysis, autoencoder, and the restricted Boltzmann machine—on the network’s overall ability to predict future market behavior. Empirical results suggest that deep neural networks can extract additional information from the residuals of the autoregressive model and improve prediction performance; the same cannot be said when the autoregressive model is applied to the residuals of the network. Covariance estimation is also noticeably improved when the predictive network is applied to covariance-based market structure analysis.

Due to the fact that many real-world problems are described by continuous variables, approximation is essential in practical applications of RL. This paper is focused on learning the value function of a fixed policy in continuous MPDs. This is an important subproblem of several \{RL\} algorithms. We propose a least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) algorithm based on the extreme learning machine. \{LSTD\} is typically combined with local function approximators, which scale poorly with the problem dimensionality. Our approach allows us to approximate value functions using single-hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs), a type of artificial neural network extensively used in many fields. Due to the global nature of SLFNs, the proposed approach is more suitable than traditional methods for high-dimensional problems. The method was empirically evaluated on a set of \{MDPs\} whose dimensionality varies from 1 to 6. For comparison purposes, experiments were replicated using a standard \{LSTD\} algorithm combined with Gaussian radial basis functions. Experimental results suggest that, although both methods can approximate accurately value functions, the proposed approach requires considerably fewer resources for the same degree of accuracy. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are typically deployed to learn a specific, concrete task based on a pre-defined reward function. However, in some cases an agent may be able to gain experience in the domain prior to being given a task. In such cases, intrinsic motivation can be used to enable the agent to learn a useful model of the environment that is likely to help it learn its eventual tasks more efficiently. This paradigm fits robots particularly well, as they need to learn about their own dynamics and affordances which can be applied to many different tasks. This article presents the texplore with Variance-And-Novelty-Intrinsic-Rewards algorithm (texplore-vanir), an intrinsically motivated model-based \{RL\} algorithm. The algorithm learns models of the transition dynamics of a domain using random forests. It calculates two different intrinsic motivations from this model: one to explore where the model is uncertain, and one to acquire novel experiences that the model has not yet been trained on. This article presents experiments demonstrating that the combination of these two intrinsic rewards enables the algorithm to learn an accurate model of a domain with no external rewards and that the learned model can be used afterward to perform tasks in the domain. While learning the model, the agent explores the domain in a developing and curious way, progressively learning more complex skills. In addition, the experiments show that combining the agent's intrinsic rewards with external task rewards enables the agent to learn faster than using external rewards alone. We also present results demonstrating the applicability of this approach to learning on robots. "}

The advantage of using the i-vector representation is that any speech utterance with a variable duration length can be represented as a fixed length vector. In modeling, a discriminative transform or classifier must be applied to emphasize the variations correlated to language identity since the i-vector representation encodes several types of the acoustic variations (e.g., speaker variation, transmission channel variation, etc.). Owing to the strong nonlinear discriminative power, the neural network model has been directly used to learn the mapping function between the i-vector representation and the language identity labels. In most studies, only the point-wise feature-label information is fed to the model for parameter learning that may result in model overfitting, particularly when with limited training data. In this study, we propose to integrate pair-wise distance metric learning as the regularization of model parameter optimization. In the representation space of nonlinear transforms in the hidden layers, a distance metric learning is explicitly designed to minimize the pair-wise intra-class variation and maximize the inter-class variation. Using the pair-wise distance metric learning, the i-vectors are transformed to a new feature space, wherein they are much more discriminative for samples belonging to different languages while being much more similar for samples belonging to the same language. We tested the algorithm on an \{SLI\} task, and obtained promising results, which outperformed conventional regularization methods. "}

This observation motives us to learn performance-optimal dictionaries for this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel joint framework for learning the multi-instance dictionary and the classifier to optimize a given multivariate performance measure, such as the \{F1\} score and precision at rank k. We propose to represent the bags as bag-level features via the bag-instance similarity, and learn a classifier in the bag-level feature space to optimize the given performance measure. We propose to minimize the upper bound of a multivariate loss corresponding to the performance measure, the complexity of the classifier, and the complexity of the dictionary, simultaneously, with regard to both the dictionary and the classifier parameters. In this way, the dictionary learning is regularized by the performance optimization, and a performance-optimal dictionary is obtained. We develop an iterative algorithm to solve this minimization problem efficiently using a cutting-plane algorithm and a coordinate descent method. Experiments on multi-instance benchmark data sets show its advantage over both traditional multi-instance learning and performance optimization methods. "}

However, the \{PID\} (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is a fast low-level control strategy widely used in many control engineering tasks. Classic control theory has contributed with different tuning methods to obtain the gains of \{PID\} controllers for specific operation conditions. Nevertheless, when the system is not fully known and the operative conditions are variable and not previously known, classical techniques are not entirely suitable for the \{PID\} tuning. To overcome these drawbacks many adaptive approaches have been arisen, mainly from the field of artificial intelligent. In this work, we propose an incremental Q-learning strategy for adaptive \{PID\} control. In order to improve the learning efficiency we define a temporal memory into the learning process. While the memory remains invariant, a non-uniform specialization process is carried out generating new limited subspaces of learning. An implementation on a real mobile robot demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach for a real-time simultaneous tuning of multiples adaptive \{PID\} controllers for a real system operating under variable conditions in a real environment.

However, most of the existing methods cannot extract features that are discriminative and at the same time invariant under some transforms. This limits the classification performance, especially in the case of small training sets. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel Partial Differential Equation (PDE) based method for feature learning. The feature learned by our \{PDE\} is discriminative, also translationally and rotationally invariant, and robust to illumination variation. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that applies \{PDE\} to feature learning and image recognition tasks. Specifically, we model feature learning as an evolution process governed by a PDE, which is designed to be translationally and rotationally invariant and is learned via minimizing the training error, hence extracts discriminative information from data. After feature extraction, we apply a linear classifier for classification. We also propose an efficient algorithm that optimizes the whole framework. Our method is very effective when the training samples are few. The experimental results of face recognition on the four benchmark face datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art feature learning methods in the case of low-resolution images and when the training samples are limited.

To date, \{TS\} diagnosis remains somewhat limited and studies using advanced diagnostic methods are of great importance. In this paper, we introduce an automatic classification framework for accurate identification of \{TS\} children based on multi-modal and multi-type features, which is robust and easy to implement. We present in detail the feature extraction, feature selection, and classifier training methods. In addition, in order to exploit complementary information revealed by different feature modalities, we integrate multi-modal image features using multiple kernel learning (MKL). The performance of our framework has been validated in classifying 44 \{TS\} children and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy children.

Most discriminative brain regions were mostly located in the cortico-basal ganglia, frontal cortico-cortical circuits, which are thought to be highly related to \{TS\} pathology.

abstract = {"Abstract Classification can be highly challenging when the dataset is extremely large, or when the training data in the underlying domain are difficult to obtain. One feasible solution to this challenge is transfer learning, which extracts the knowledge from source tasks and applies the knowledge to target tasks. Extant transfer learning schemes typically assume that similarities between the source task and the target task to some degree. This assumption does not hold in certain actual applications; analysts unfamiliar with the learning strategy can be frustrated by the complicated transfer relations and the non-intuitive transfer process. This paper presents a suite of visual communication and interaction techniques to support the transfer learning process. Furthermore, a pioneering visual-assisted transfer learning methodology is proposed in the context of classification. Our solution includes a visual communication interface that allows for comprehensive exploration of the entire knowledge transfer process and the relevance among tasks. With these techniques and the methodology, the analysts can intuitively choose relevant tasks and data, as well as iteratively incorporate their experience and expertise into the analysis process. We demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our visual design and the analysis approach with examples of text classification. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Extracting the underlying low-dimensional space where high-dimensional signals often reside has been at the center of numerous algorithms in the signal processing and machine learning literature during the past few decades. Moreover, working with incomplete large scale datasets has recently been commonplace for diverse reasons. This so called big data era we are currently living calls for devising online subspace learning algorithms that can suitably handle incomplete data. Their anticipated goal is to recursively estimate the unknown subspace by processing streaming data sequentially, thus reducing computational complexity. In this paper, an online variational Bayes subspace learning algorithm from partial observations is presented. To account for the unawareness of the true rank of the subspace, commonly met in practice, low-rankness is explicitly imposed on the sought subspace data matrix by exploiting sparse Bayesian learning principles. Sparsity, simultaneously to low-rankness, is favored on the subspace matrix by the sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian scheme that is adopted. The proposed algorithm is thus adept in dealing with applications whereby the underlying subspace may be also sparse. The new subspace tracking scheme outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of estimation accuracy, in a variety of experiments conducted on both simulated and real data. "}

Methods The application was developed and tested using data collected in a Brazilian hospital. The available data were used to feed an \{ML\} pipeline that was designed to create a simulator capable of predicting the outcome (death probability) for newborns admitted to neonatal intensive care units. However, unlike previous scoring systems, our computational tool is not intended to be used at the patients bedside, although it is possible. Our primary goal is to deliver a computational system to aid medical research in understanding the correlation of key variables with the studied outcome so that new standards can be established for future clinical decisions. In the implemented simulation environment, the values of key attributes can be changed using a user-friendly interface, where the impact of each change on the outcome is immediately reported, allowing a quantitative analysis, in addition to a qualitative investigation, and delivering a totally interactive computational tool that facilitates hypothesis construction and testing. Results Our statistical experiments showed that the resulting model for death prediction could achieve an accuracy of 86.7% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 for the positive class. Using this model, three physicians and a neonatal nutritionist performed simulations with key variables correlated with chance of death. The results indicated important tendencies for the effect of each variable and the combination of variables on prognosis. We could also observe values of gestational age and birth weight for which a low Apgar score and the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) could be less or more severe. For instance, we have noticed that for a newborn with 2000 g or more the occurrence of \{RDS\} is far less problematic than for neonates weighing less. Conclusions The significant accuracy demonstrated by our predictive model shows that \{NICeSim\} might be used for hypothesis testing to minimize in vivo experiments. We observed that the model delivers predictions that are in very good agreement with the literature, demonstrating that \{NICeSim\} might be an important tool for supporting decision making in medical practice. Other very important characteristics of \{NICeSim\} are its flexibility and dynamism. \{NICeSim\} is flexible because it allows the inclusion and deletion of variables according to the requirements of a particular study. It is also dynamic because it trains a just-in-time model. Therefore, the system is improved as data from new patients become available. Finally, \{NICeSim\} can be extended in a cooperative manner because it is an open-source system. "}

Particularly, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method has been widely applied to find one discriminant low-dimensional subspace for gait recognition. However, when gait templates changed by clothing, view angle, load carrying and road surface variants, only learning one single subspace is prone to dropping into local optimum. In this paper, a subspace ensemble learning using totally-corrective boosting (SEL_TCB) framework and its tensor-based and local patch-based extensions are proposed for gait recognition. In this framework, multiple discriminant subspaces are iteratively learned using totally-corrective boosting technology to preserve the proximity relationships described by instance triplets. Meanwhile, by constructing different triplet set, the presented framework can deal with complex application environments. Further, we extend SEL_TCB framework to tensor SEL_TCB (TSEL_TCB) framework which effectively preserves the structural information of the gait template. Meanwhile, compared with the holistic appearance-based SEL_TCB framework, a local patch-based SEL_TCB (LPSEL_TCB) framework is proposed, which iteratively learns multiple discriminant subspaces corresponding to several local patches selected from the gait template. The proposed method is compared with the recently published gait recognition approaches on \{USF\} HumanID database and \{CASIA\} Gait database. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves highly competitive performance against state-of-the-art gait recognition approaches. "}

To overcome the above two drawbacks, a variable step learning algorithm is proposed for learning a Gaussian mixture models. The novelty of the algorithm is that a variable step search strategy is proposed to find the actual number of Gaussian mixture components, or slightly above it. This number is obtained by maximizing the Bhattacharyya coefficient criterion, which in turn quantifies how close the Gaussian mixtures models fit the observed data. Furthermore, the initialization parameters are determined by the correlation coefficient criterion representing the shape characteristics between the new \{GMM\} and the histograms of the data. Based on these two criteria, the proposed algorithm can make both parameter learning and model selection more efficient, as shown by the conducted experiments. "}

They have shown very good results in many problem domains. However, current implementations of \{MLNs\} do not scale well due to the large search space and the intractable clause groundings, which is preventing their widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose a general framework named Ground Network Sampling (GNS) for scaling up \{MLN\} learning and inference. \{GNS\} offers a new instantiation perspective by encoding ground substitutions as simple paths in the Herbrand universe, which uses the interactions existing among the objects to constrain the search space. To further make this search tractable for large scale problems, \{GNS\} integrates random walks and subgraph pattern mining, gradually building up a representative subset of simple paths. When inference is concerned, a template network is introduced to quickly locate promising paths that can ground given logical statements. The resulting sampled paths are then transformed into ground clauses, which can be used for clause creation and probabilistic inference. The experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach offers better scalability while maintaining comparable or better predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art \{MLN\} techniques.

In this paper, we propose a novel prior knowledge of the abnormal tumor regions, which may be complementary to base segmentation model. Based on this idea, we develop a breast tumor segmentation approach with prior knowledge learning. The proposed method mainly consists of two steps: prior knowledge learning and segmentation model construction. In the first step, prior knowledge learning model is developed to learn prior information which can be used to classify abnormal tumor regions correctly. It's difficult for base segmentation model to obtain accurate segmentation result of abnormal tumor areas. Therefore, learned prior knowledge is complementary to base segmentation model. In order to exploit learned prior knowledge, prior knowledge-based constraints are incorporated into the base segmentation model for robust segmentation model construction. In order to verify performance of the proposed method, we construct a breast ultrasound images database contained 186 cases (135 benign cases and 51 malignant cases) by collecting the breast images from four types of ultrasonic devices. Our experimental results on the constructed database demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. "}

Inspired by the concept of historical population, two new phases, namely self-feedback learning phase as well as mutation and crossover phase, are introduced in I-TLBO algorithm. In self-feedback learning phase, a learner can improve his result based on the historical experience if his present state is better than the historical state. In mutation and crossover phase, the learners update their positions with probability based on the new population obtained by the crossover and mutation operations between present population and historical population. The design of self-feedback learning phase seeks the maintaining of good exploitation ability while the introduction of the mutation and crossover phase aims at the improvement of exploration ability in original TLBO. The effectiveness of proposed I-TLBO algorithm is tested on some benchmark functions and a combinatorial optimization problem of heat treating in foundry industry. The comparative results with some other improved \{TLBO\} algorithms and classic algorithms show that I-TLBO algorithm has significant advantages due to the balance between exploitation and exploration ability.

In spite of numerous research groups that have investigated ML-based segmentation frameworks, there remains unanswered aspects of performance variability for the choice of two key components: \{ML\} algorithm and intensity normalization. This investigation reveals that the choice of those elements plays a major part in determining segmentation accuracy and generalizability. The approach we have used in this study aims to evaluate relative benefits of the two elements within a subcortical \{MRI\} segmentation framework. Experiments were conducted to contrast eight machine-learning algorithm configurations and 11 normalization strategies for our brain \{MR\} segmentation framework. For the intensity normalization, a Stable Atlas-based Mapped Prior (STAMP) was utilized to take better account of contrast along boundaries of structures. Comparing eight machine learning algorithms on down-sampled segmentation \{MR\} data, it was obvious that a significant improvement was obtained using ensemble-based \{ML\} algorithms (i.e., random forest) or \{ANN\} algorithms. Further investigation between these two algorithms also revealed that the random forest results provided exceptionally good agreement with manual delineations by experts. Additional experiments showed that the effect of STAMP-based intensity normalization also improved the robustness of segmentation for multicenter data sets. The constructed framework obtained good multicenter reliability and was successfully applied on a large multicenter \{MR\} data set (n &gt; 3000). Less than 10% of automated segmentations were recommended for minimal expert intervention. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using the ML-based segmentation tools for processing large amount of multicenter \{MR\} images. We demonstrated dramatically different result profiles in segmentation accuracy according to the choice of \{ML\} algorithm and intensity normalization chosen. "}

Application of new analytical approaches can help translate the improved understanding of early functional connectivity provided through these studies into predictive models of neurodevelopmental outcome. One approach to achieving this goal is multivariate pattern analysis, a machine-learning, pattern classification approach well-suited for high-dimensional neuroimaging data. It has previously been adapted to predict brain maturity in children and adolescents using structural and resting state-functional \{MRI\} data. In this study, we evaluated resting state-functional \{MRI\} data from 50 preterm-born infants (born at 23–29 weeks of gestation and without moderate–severe brain injury) scanned at term equivalent postmenstrual age compared with data from 50 term-born control infants studied within the first week of life. Using 214 regions of interest, binary support vector machines distinguished term from preterm infants with 84% accuracy (p &lt; 0.0001). Inter- and intra-hemispheric connections throughout the brain were important for group categorization, indicating that widespread changes in the brain's functional network architecture associated with preterm birth are detectable by term equivalent age. Support vector regression enabled quantitative estimation of birth gestational age in single subjects using only term equivalent resting state-functional \{MRI\} data, indicating that the present approach is sensitive to the degree of disruption of brain development associated with preterm birth (using gestational age as a surrogate for the extent of disruption). This suggests that support vector regression may provide a means for predicting neurodevelopmental outcome in individual infants. "}

The main contribution is development of an architecture that combines a linear model that is fitted using ℓ 1 regularization and a sequence of tanh layers. The challenge of predicting traffic flows are the sharp nonlinearities due to transitions between free flow, breakdown, recovery and congestion. We show that deep learning architectures can capture these nonlinear spatio-temporal effects. The first layer identifies spatio-temporal relations among predictors and other layers model nonlinear relations. We illustrate our methodology on road sensor data from Interstate I-55 and predict traffic flows during two special events; a Chicago Bears football game and an extreme snowstorm event. Both cases have sharp traffic flow regime changes, occurring very suddenly, and we show how deep learning provides precise short term traffic flow predictions. "}

For the prediction of Hb, both analytical measurements and medication dosage of patients suffering from chronic renal failure (CRF) are used. Two kinds of models were trained, global and local models. In the case of local models, clustering techniques based on hierarchical approaches and the adaptive resonance theory (ART) were used as a first step, and then, a different predictor was used for each obtained cluster. Different global models have been applied to the dataset such as Linear Models, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Regression Trees among others. Also a relevance analysis has been carried out for each predictor model, thus finding those features that are most relevant for the given prediction. "}

Unlike most existing methods which utilize hand-crafted descriptors for face representation, our GA-DFL method learns a discriminative feature descriptor per image directly from raw pixels for face representation under the deep convolutional neural networks framework. Motivated by the fact that age labels are chronologically correlated and the facial aging datasets are usually lack of labeled data for each person in a long range of ages, we split ordinal ages into a set of discrete groups and learn deep feature transformations across age groups to project each face pair into the new feature space, where the intra-group variances of positive face pairs from the training set are minimized and the inter-group variances of negative face pairs are maximized, simultaneously. Moreover, we employ an overlapped coupled learning method to exploit the smoothness for adjacent age groups. To further enhance the discriminative capacity of face representation, we design a multi-path \{CNN\} approach to integrate the complementary information from multi-scale perspectives. Experimental results show that our approach achieves very competitive performance compared with most state-of-the-arts on three public face aging datasets that were captured under both controlled and uncontrolled environments.

Traditionally, the control parameters of the actuators are obtained through huge amount of trial-and-error experiments. However, using traditional approach to calibrate these parameters becomes more challenging with the increasing incorporation of new technologies into advanced engines. In order to reduce the number of experiments required in the calibration process of modern engines, a novel point-by-point engine calibration approach based on machine learning methods is proposed in this study. It is an iterative procedure that, for a given operating point, sequential design of experiment (DoE) strategy is utilized to measure the responses of different engine sensors corresponding to different actuator signals, and a machine learning algorithm called initial-training-free online extreme learning machine is utilized to incrementally learn the relationship between the sensors and actuators based on the measurement acquired. In each iterative cycle, meta-heuristic optimization is performed on the machine-learning-based model to search for the best parameters, which are then used as the initial parameters for generating DoE plan of the next cycle. The iteration is repeated until the optimal parameters of that operating point are found. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments on both simulation engine in commercial software and real engine in test bench have been conducted. The results show that the engine calibration can be carried out with significant fewer experiments and time by using the proposed approach. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Multi-class classification learning can be implemented by the decomposition to binary classification or the direct techniques. The decomposition technique simplifies s the original learning problem into a set of binary subproblems, separately learns each one, and then combines their results to make a final decision. While the direct technique learns a set of multi-class classifiers by directly optimizing one single objective function. Plenty of empirical results have shown that the two techniques achieve comparable performance. However, both the techniques are mainly designed for vector-pattern samples at present. These traditional vector-pattern-oriented decomposition technique has been extended to a new type of matrix-pattern-oriented classifiers which obtain better learning performance and reduce the learning time–cost by utilizing the original structural information of the input matrix. To our best knowledge, no direct multi-class learning method for matrix pattern has been proposed so far. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a direct multi-class classification technique to compensate such a missing, which is a natural extension of the vector-based direct multi-class classification technique. Simultaneously, the left or right vector acting on matrix pattern in the multi-class matrixized objective function plays a role of a tradeoff parameter to balance the capacity of learning and generalization. Finally, based on the original binary-classifier Matrix-pattern-oriented Modified Ho-Kashyap classifier named MatMHKS, we design a corresponding Direct Multi-class Matrixized Learning Machine named McMatMHKS. It is the first direct multi-class classification technique for matrix patterns. To validate both feasibility and effectiveness of McMatMHKS, we conduct the comparative experiments on some benchmark datasets with two multi-class support vector machines and MatMHKS with the decomposition technique including both one-vs-one and one-vs-all. The results show that like its vector-oriented counterpart, McMatMHKS not only has comparable classification accuracy and \{AUC\} value, but also owns lower time complexity when compared with its corresponding decomposition machines.

Most previous works employ matrix factorization techniques to learn the latent factors of users and items.

However, matrix factorization methods may not make full use of the limited information from rating or check-in matrices, and achieve unsatisfying results. Recently, deep learning has proven able to learn good representation in natural language processing, image classification, and so on. Along this line, we propose a new representation learning framework called Recommendation via Dual-Autoencoder (ReDa). In this framework, we simultaneously learn the new hidden representations of users and items using autoencoders, and minimize the deviations of training data by the learnt representations of users and items. Based on this framework, we develop a gradient descent method to learn hidden representations. Extensive experiments conducted on several real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art matrix factorization based methods. "}

This is leading to increase in the use of the machine learning methods for analyzing and assessing public domain data sets. These methods can be used in developing models for estimating software quality attributes such as fault proneness, maintenance effort, testing effort. Software fault prediction in the early phases of software development can help and guide software practitioners to focus the available testing resources on the weaker areas during the software development. This paper analyses and compares the statistical and six machine learning methods for fault prediction. These methods (Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Cascade Correlation Network, Support Vector Machine, Group Method of Data Handling Method, and Gene Expression Programming) are empirically validated to find the relationship between the static code metrics and the fault proneness of a module. In order to assess and compare the models predicted using the regression and the machine learning methods we used two publicly available data sets \{AR1\} and AR6. We compared the predictive capability of the models using the Area Under the Curve (measured from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis). The study confirms the predictive capability of the machine learning methods for software fault prediction. The results show that the Area Under the Curve of model predicted using the Decision Tree method is 0.8 and 0.9 (for \{AR1\} and \{AR6\} data sets, respectively) and is a better model than the model predicted using the logistic regression and other machine learning methods.

The aim is to suggest both to a user the best classes to join with and to the classes themselves the best students to accept.

A dolphin microarray representing 24,418 unigene sequences was used to analyze blood samples collected from 47 dolphins during capture-release health assessments from five different \{US\} coastal locations (Beaufort, NC, Sarasota Bay, FL, Saint Joseph Bay, FL, Sapelo Island, \{GA\} and Brunswick, GA). Organohalogen contaminants including pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners were determined in blubber biopsy samples from the same animals. A subset of samples (n = 10, males; n = 8, females) with the highest and the lowest measured values of \{PCBs\} in their blubber was used as strata to determine the differential gene expression of the exposure extremes through machine learning classification algorithms. A set of genes associated primarily with nuclear and \{DNA\} stability, cell division and apoptosis regulation, intra- and extra-cellular traffic, and immune response activation was selected by the algorithm for identifying the two exposure extremes. In order to test the hypothesis that these gene expression patterns reflect \{PCB\} exposure, we next investigated the blood transcriptomes of the remaining dolphin samples using machine-learning approaches, including K-nn and Support Vector Machines classifiers. Using the derived gene sets, the algorithms worked very well (100% success rate) at classifying dolphins according to the contaminant load accumulated in their blubber.

On one hand, unlike those methods of learning features on low-level pixels, we propose to learn features via a particular sparse coding algorithm enhanced on mid-level image representation, in order to obtain higher-level latent semantics and robustness; On the other hand, those methods usually utilize label information in model training such as deformable part model (DPM) with high computation cost. Instead, we propose to extend the learning process via a maximum margin criterion, in order to better encode discriminative information directly in features by optimizing them to be close to each other if from the same class and far from each other if from different classes. Furthermore, a boosted detection framework rather than the complex \{DPM\} is adopted to achieve both high accuracy and efficiency. The proposed approach achieves promising results on several standard pedestrian detection benchmarks. "}

This technique motivates bilateral transfer learning between the modalities by taking the outer product of each feature extractor output. Furthermore, we devise a technique for multi-scale feature abstraction using deeply supervised branches which are connected to all convolutional layers of the multi-stream CNN. We show that end-to-end learning of the network is feasible even with a limited amount of training data and the trained network generalizes across different datasets and applications.

abstract = {"Abstract The spiking neural networks (SNNs) are the third generation of artificial neural networks, which have made great achievements in the field of pattern recognition. However, the existing supervised training methods of \{SNNs\} are not efficient enough to meet the real-time requirement in most cases. To address this issue, the normalized perceptron based learning rule (NPBLR) is proposed in this paper for the supervised training of the multi-layer SNNs. Different from traditional methods, our algorithm only trains the selected misclassified time points and the target ones, employing the perceptron based neuron. Furthermore, the weight modification in our algorithm is normalized by a voltage based function, which is more efficient than the traditional time based method because the firing time is calculated by the voltage value. Superior to the traditional multi-layer algorithm ignoring the time accumulation of spikes, our algorithm defines the spiking activity of the postsynaptic neuron as the rate accumulation function of all presynaptic neurons in a specific time-frame. By these strategies, our algorithm overcomes some difficulties in the training of SNNs, e.g., the inefficient and no-fire problems. Comprehensive simulations are conducted both in single and multi-layer networks to investigate the learning performance of our algorithm, whose results demonstrate that our algorithm possesses higher learning efficiency and stronger parameter robustness than traditional algorithms.

abstract = {"Abstract Learning-based planning algorithms are currently gaining popularity for their increasing applications in real-time planning and cooperation of robots. The paper aims at extending traditional multi-agent Q-learning algorithms to improve their speed of convergence by incorporating two interesting properties, concerning (i) exploration of the team-goal and (ii) selection of joint action at a given joint state. The exploration of team-goal is realized by allowing the agents, capable of reaching their goals, to wait at their individual goal states, until remaining agents explore their individual goals synchronously or asynchronously. To avoid unwanted never-ending wait-loops, an upper bound to wait-interval, obtained empirically for the waiting team members, is introduced. Selection of joint action, which is a crucial problem in traditional multi-agent Q-learning, is performed here by taking the intersection of individual preferred joint actions of all the agents. In case the resulting intersection is a null set, the individual actions are selected randomly or otherwise following classical multi-agent Q-learning. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that the extended algorithms outperform its traditional counterpart with respect to speed of convergence. To ensure selection of right joint action at each step of planning, we offer high rewards to exploration of the team-goal and zero rewards to exploration of individual goals during the learning phase. The introduction of the above strategy results in an enriched joint Q-table, the consultation of which during the multi-agent planning yields significant improvement in the performance of cooperative planning of robots. Hardwired realization of the proposed learning based planning algorithm, designed for object-transportation application, confirms the relative merits of the proposed technique over contestant algorithms.

However, multi-view data are often incomplete, namely some samples have incomplete feature sets. Besides, most data are unlabeled due to a large cost of manual annotation, which makes learning of such data a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning framework for incomplete and unlabeled multi-view data. The model directly optimizes the class indicator matrix, which establishes a bridge for incomplete feature sets. Besides, feature selection is considered to deal with high dimensional and noisy features. Furthermore, the inter-view and intra-view data similarities are preserved to enhance the model. To these ends, an objective is developed along with an efficient optimization strategy. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted for multi-view clustering and cross-modal retrieval, achieving the state-of-the-art performance under various settings. "}

Most common approaches are whole-genome regression models where phenotypes are regressed on thousands of markers concurrently, applying different prior distributions to marker effects. While use of shrinkage or regularization in \{SNP\} regression models has delivered improvements in predictive ability in genome-based evaluations, serious over-fitting problems may be encountered as the ratio between markers and available phenotypes continues increasing. Machine learning is an alternative approach for prediction and classification, capable of dealing with the dimensionality problem in a computationally flexible manner. In this article we provide an overview of non-parametric and machine learning methods used in genome wide prediction, discuss their similarities as well as their relationship to some well-known parametric approaches. Although the most suitable method is usually case dependent, we suggest the use of support vector machines and random forests for classification problems, whereas Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces regression and boosting may suit better regression problems, with the former having the more consistently higher predictive ability. Neural Networks may suffer from over-fitting and may be too computationally demanded when the number of neurons is large. We further discuss on the metrics used to evaluate predictive ability in model comparison under cross-validation from a genomic selection point of view. We suggest use of predictive mean squared error as a main but not only metric for model comparison. Visual tools may greatly assist on the choice of the most accurate model. "}

abstract = {"AbstractContext Defect prediction is a very meaningful topic, particularly at change-level. Change-level defect prediction, which is also referred as just-in-time defect prediction, could not only ensure software quality in the development process, but also make the developers check and fix the defects in time [1]. Objective Ensemble learning becomes a hot topic in recent years. There have been several studies about applying ensemble learning to defect prediction [2–5]. Traditional ensemble learning approaches only have one layer, i.e., they use ensemble learning once. There are few studies that leverages ensemble learning twice or more. To bridge this research gap, we try to hybridize various ensemble learning methods to see if it will improve the performance of just-in-time defect prediction. In particular, we focus on one way to do this by hybridizing bagging and stacking together and leave other possibly hybridization strategies for future work. Method In this paper, we propose a two-layer ensemble learning approach \{TLEL\} which leverages decision tree and ensemble learning to improve the performance of just-in-time defect prediction. In the inner layer, we combine decision tree and bagging to build a Random Forest model. In the outer layer, we use random under-sampling to train many different Random Forest models and use stacking to ensemble them once more. Results To evaluate the performance of TLEL, we use two metrics, i.e., cost effectiveness and F1-score. We perform experiments on the datasets from six large open source projects, i.e., Bugzilla, Columba, JDT, Platform, Mozilla, and PostgreSQL, containing a total of 137,417 changes. Also, we compare our approach with three baselines, i.e., Deeper, the approach proposed by us [6], DNC, the approach proposed by Wang et al. [2], and MKEL, the approach proposed by Wang et al. [3]. The experimental results show that on average across the six datasets, \{TLEL\} could discover over 70% of the bugs by reviewing only 20% of the lines of code, as compared with about 50% for the baselines. In addition, the F1-scores \{TLEL\} can achieve are substantially and statistically significantly higher than those of three baselines across the six datasets. Conclusion \{TLEL\} can achieve a substantial and statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., Deeper, \{DNC\} and MKEL. Moreover, \{TLEL\} could discover over 70% of the bugs by reviewing only 20% of the lines of code. "}

However, their traditional learning algorithms are usually much slower than required. In this work, two hidden-feature-space ridge regression methods \{HFSR\} and centered-ELM are first proposed for feedforward networks. As the special kernel methods, the important characteristics of both \{HFSR\} and centered-ELM are that rigorous Mercer's condition for kernel functions is not required and that they can inherently be used to propagate the prominent advantages of \{ELM\} into MLFN. Except for randomly assigned weights adopted in both \{ELM\} and HFSR, \{HFSR\} also exploits another randomness, i.e., randomly selected examplars from the training set for kernel activation functions. Through forward layer-by-layer data transformation, we can extend \{HFSR\} and Centered-ELM to MLFN. Accordingly, as the unified framework for \{HFSR\} and Centered-ELM, the least learning machine (LLM) is proposed for both \{SLFN\} and \{MLFN\} with a single or multiple outputs. \{LLM\} actually gives a new learning method for \{MLFN\} with keeping the same virtues of \{ELM\} only for SLFN, i.e., only the parameters in the last hidden layer require being adjusted, all the parameters in other hidden layers can be randomly assigned, and \{LLM\} is also much faster than \{BP\} for \{MLFN\} in training the sample sets. The experimental results clearly indicate the power of \{LLM\} on its application in nonlinear regression modeling. "}

The correlation of the maximum stable cutting depth and the spindle speed can be shown in a stability lobe diagram (SLD). The stability is different for different width of cut and can change with the axis positions. Today it is already a great effort to estimate the \{SLD\} only for one position. Many experiments are necessary to measure the \{SLD\} or derive a detailed mathematical model to calculate the SLD. Moreover not only the cutting depth, but also the cutting width should be represented in the SLD. This paper presents a new approach to assess the process stability based on measured acceleration signals. The multidimensional stability lobe diagram (MSLD) are derived during the production using two new continuously learning algorithms. In this paper the application of a continuous learning support vector machine and a continuous neural network is shown. The support vector machine and the neural network are extended to make them capable for continuous learning and time-variant systems. A new trust criterion is introduced, which gives information about the prediction quality of the output for the selected input region. The learned \{MSLDs\} are evaluated against analytically calculated \{MSLDs\} and the learning algorithms can reproduce the analytical results very well. "}

We assume that the relationships among the views can be learnt from the whole collection of views (or items). The task is then to reproduce the missing part of the incomplete items from the relationships derived from the complete items and the known part of these items. Using certain properties of tensor algebra, we showed that this problem can be formulated consistently as a regression type learning task. Furthermore, there is a maximum margin based optimisation framework in which this problem can be solved in a tractable way. This problem is similar to learning to predict where a person is looking in an image. Therefore, we proposed an algorithm called “Tensor-based Multi-View Learning”(TMVL) in this paper. Furthermore, we also proposed a technique for improving prediction by introducing a new feature set obtained from Kronecker decomposition of the image fused with user’s eye movement data. Using this new feature can improve prediction performance markedly. The proposed approach was proven to be more effective than two well-known saliency detection techniques. "}

Digital cameras or near remote systems have been efficiently applied as multi-channel imaging sensors, where leaf color information is extracted from the \{RGB\} (Red, Green, and Blue) color channels, and the changes in green levels are used to infer leafing patterns of plant species. In this scenario, texture information is a great ally for image analysis that has been little used in phenology studies. We monitored leaf-changing patterns of Cerrado savanna vegetation by taking daily digital images. We extract \{RGB\} channels from the digital images and correlate them with phenological changes. Additionally, we benefit from the inclusion of textural metrics for quantifying spatial heterogeneity. Our first goals are: (1) to test if color change information is able to characterize the phenological pattern of a group of species; (2) to test if the temporal variation in image texture is useful to distinguish plant species; and (3) to test if individuals from the same species may be automatically identified using digital images. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach based on multiscale classifiers to detect phenological patterns in the digital images. Our results indicate that: (1) extreme hours (morning and afternoon) are the best for identifying plant species; (2) different plant species present a different behavior with respect to the color change information; and (3) texture variation along temporal images is promising information for capturing phenological patterns. Based on those results, we suggest that individuals from the same species and functional group might be identified using digital images, and introduce a new tool to help phenology experts in the identification of new individuals from the same species in the image and their location on the ground.

In this paper, by using pairwise metric learning, we present a novel appearance model for robust visual tracking. Specifically, visual tracking is viewed as a pairwise regression problem, and extreme learning machine (ELM) is utilized to construct the pairwise regression framework. In ELM-based pairwise training, two constraints are enforced: the target observations must have different regression outputs from those background ones; while the various target observations during tracking should have approximate regression outputs. Thus, the discriminative and generative capabilities are fully considered in a single object tracking model. Moreover, online sequential \{ELM\} (OS-ELM) is used to update the resulting appearance model, thereby leading to a more robust tracking process. Extensive experimental evaluations on challenging video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed tracker. "}

abstract = {"Abstract It is a challenging problem to design excellent dictionaries to sparsely represent diverse fault information and simultaneously discriminate different fault sources. Therefore, this paper describes and analyzes a novel multiple feature recognition framework which incorporates the tight frame learning technique with an adaptive subspace recognition strategy. The proposed framework consists of four stages. Firstly, by introducing the tight frame constraint into the popular dictionary learning model, the proposed tight frame learning model could be formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem which can be solved by alternatively implementing hard thresholding operation and singular value decomposition. Secondly, the noises are effectively eliminated through transform sparse coding techniques. Thirdly, the denoised signal is decoupled into discriminative feature subspaces by each tight frame filter. Finally, in guidance of elaborately designed fault related sensitive indexes, latent fault feature subspaces can be adaptively recognized and multiple faults are diagnosed simultaneously. Extensive numerical experiments are sequently implemented to investigate the sparsifying capability of the learned tight frame as well as its comprehensive denoising performance. Most importantly, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed framework is verified through performing multiple fault diagnosis of motor bearings. Compared with the state-of-the-art fault detection techniques, some important advantages have been observed: firstly, the proposed framework incorporates the physical prior with the data-driven strategy and naturally multiple fault feature with similar oscillation morphology can be adaptively decoupled. Secondly, the tight frame dictionary directly learned from the noisy observation can significantly promote the sparsity of fault features compared to analytical tight frames. Thirdly, a satisfactory complete signal space description property is guaranteed and thus weak feature leakage problem is avoided compared to typical learning methods. "}

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel active learning method via local structure reconstruction to select representative data points. Specifically, we construct a simple but effective graph to search the local relationship of data points. Then an optimization model is formulated to fulfill the data point reconstruction and select the most representative data points. Furthermore, we define a simple but useful classifier based on a linear regression model for better exploring the potential classification performance of selected data points. Experimental results on two synthetic datasets and two face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the efficiency of the defined classifier. "}

Ensemble techniques have been widely applied in other fields; however, their application is still rare in the assessment of landslide problems. Meanwhile, \{MLP\} Neural Nets, which is known as an artificial neural network, has been applied widely and efficiently in landslide problems. In the present study, landslide models of part Himalayan area (India) have been constructed and validated. For the evaluation and comparison of these models, receiver operating characteristic curve and Chi Square test methods have been applied. Overall, all landslide models performed well in landslide susuceptibility assessment but the performance of the MultiBoost model is the highest (AUC = 0.886), followed by Dagging model (AUC = 0.885), the Rotation Forest model (AUC = 0.882), the Bagging and Random SubSpace models (AUC = 0.881), and the AdaBoost model (AUC = 0.876), respectively. Moreover, machine learning ensemble models have improved significantly the performance of the base classifier of \{MLP\} Neural Nets (AUC = 0.874).

Retrieving many relevant items is quite important, but it does not necessarily completely satisfy the user needs. When only relevant near-duplicate items are retrieved, the amount of different concepts users are able to extract from the target collection is very limited. Therefore, broadening the number of concepts present in a result set may improve the overall search experience. Diversifying concepts present in the retrieved set is one possibility for increasing the information gain in a single search iteration, maximizing the likelihood of including at least some relevant items for each possible intent of ambiguous or underspecified queries. Relevance feedback approaches may also take advantage of diverse results to improve internal machine learning models. In this context, this work proposes and analyses several multimodal image retrieval approaches built over a learning framework for relevance feedback on diversified results. Our experimental analysis shows that different retrieval modalities are positively impacted by diversity, but achieve best retrieval effectiveness with diversification applied at different moments of a search session. Moreover, the best results are achieved with a query-by-example approach using multimodal information obtained from feedback. In summary, we demonstrate that learning with diversity is an effective alternative for boosting multimodal interactive learning approaches. "}

This paper tries to learn this certain relation via neural network and the learned network, which reflects the relation, can be partly perceived as degradation pattern. The main prognostic idea of degradation pattern learning is firstly proposed and illustrated. And then an improved back propagation neural network is designed and analyzed as the implementation technique, in whose loss function an adjacent difference item is added. Next details of implementation via adjacent difference neural network are elaborated. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by two experiments respectively using different aircraft engine degradation datasets. Results of the experiments show a relatively good prediction accuracy, which verifies the correctness, effectiveness and practicability of the idea. "}

We model the detection of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) as the classification of the brightest block in the current running difference image. Because \{CMEs\} usually correspond to the areas with high gray values or complex texture features, multiple features including gray features and texture features are extracted to represent the brightest block. And classifier is designed based on these features. Our method includes four steps: first, because the \{CMEs\} spread along the radial direction of the sun, in order to facilitate the analysis, the original coordinate is transformed into the polar coordinate; Secondly, because the typical appearance of the \{CMEs\} is bright or complex texture enhancement, we use the brightest block to represent the whole image; Thirdly, we extract the gray, texture and \{HOG\} features of the brightest gray blocks. Finally, we use the extracted features to design decision trees as the base classifiers, and AdaBoost is used to obtain the final ensemble classifier. As far as we know, this is the first time that the learning based classification framework is presented in the \{CMEs\} detection. Moreover, multiple feature fusion is first used to model the various CMEs. Experimental results show that the integration of multi-feature based detection algorithm proposed can achieve better detection results. "}

Visual ambiguities caused by variations in view angle, lighting, and occlusions make the re-identification problem extremely challenging. To overcome the ambiguities, most previous approaches often extract robust feature representations or learn a sophisticated feature transformation. However, most of these approaches ignore the effect of the impostors arising from annotation or tracking process. In this case, impostors are regarded as genuine and applied in training process, leading to the model drift problem. In order to reduce the risk of model drifting, we propose to automatically discover impostors in a multiple instance metric learning framework. Specifically, we propose a kNN based confidence score to evaluate how much an impostor invades the interested target and utilize it as a prior in the framework. In the meanwhile, we integrate an impostor rejection mechanism in the multiple instance metric learning framework to automatically discover impostors, and learn the semantical similarity metrics with the refined training set. Experiments show that the proposed system performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms on two challenging datasets (iLIDS-VID and \{PRID\} 2011).

However, obtaining labeled data is very expensive, time consuming and difficult in real-life practical situations as labeling a data set requires the effort of a human expert. On the other side, unlabeled data are often plentiful which makes it relatively inexpensive and easier to obtain. Semi-Supervised Learning methods strive to utilize this plentiful source of unlabeled examples to increase the learning capacity of the classifier particularly when amount of labeled examples are restricted. Since \{SSL\} techniques usually reach higher accuracy and require less human effort, they attract a substantial amount of attention both in practical applications and theoretical research. A novel semi-supervised methodology is offered in this study. This algorithm utilizes a new method to predict the class labels of unlabeled examples in a corpus and incorporate them into the training set to build a better classifier. The approach presented here depends on a meaning calculation, which computes the words’ meaning scores in the scope of classes. Meaning computation is constructed on the Helmholtz principle and utilized to various applications in the field of text mining like feature extraction, information retrieval and document summarization. Nevertheless, according to the literature, \{ILBOM\} is the first work which uses meaning calculation in a semi-supervised way to construct a semantic smoothing kernel for Support Vector Machines (SVM). Evaluation of the proposed methodology is done by performing various experiments on standard textual datasets. ILBOM's experimental results are compared with three baseline algorithms including \{SVM\} using linear kernel which is one of the most frequently used algorithms in text classification field. Experimental results show that labeling unlabeled instances based on meaning scores of words to augment the training set is valuable, and increases the classification accuracy on previously unseen test instances significantly.

In fact, it is always a time-consuming and laborious thing to label the unlabeled samples, and the numbers of collected unlabeled samples are often far greater than that of the labeled samples.

The hypothesis underlying this approach is that cancers have characteristic biochemical fingerprints that can be captured using spectroscopy. To relate complex multivariate spectra to disease state, machine-learning methods are typically used to recognize diagnostic spectral patterns. This article provides an extensive review of this field. The average diagnostic performance of the reviewed studies is impressive (&gt;90% sensitivity and specificity) but most studies were small (&lt;40 samples). Furthermore, diagnostic performance has often been calculated using methods now known to be overoptimistic. We conclude that, if the combination of spectroscopy and machine learning is to translate into clinical practice, larger studies are needed and researchers should routinely provide spectral data in support of their publications so that the data can be reanalyzed by other groups.

The main methods of the proposed model mainly include: first, \{EEMD\} is presented to decompose the original data of PM2.5 concentration into some intrinsic model functions (IMFs); second, \{PSR\} is applied to determine the input form of each extracted component; third, LSSVM, an effective forecasting tool, is used to predict all reconstructed components independently; finally, another \{LSSVM\} is employed to aggregate all predicted components into ensemble results for the final prediction. The empirical results show that this proposed model can outperform the comparison models and can significantly improve the prediction performance in terms of higher predictive and directional accuracy.

Results suggest that the use of any of these \{ML\} algorithms leads to an improvement in the accuracy—in terms of the \{AUC\} (area under the curve)—of the model when compared to \{LR\} outputs. According to the \{AUC\} values, \{RF\} and \{BRT\} seem to be the most adequate methods, reaching \{AUC\} values of 0.746 and 0.730 respectively. On the other hand, despite the fact that the \{SVM\} yields an \{AUC\} value higher than that from LR, the authors consider it inadequate for classifying wildfire occurrences because its calibration is extremely time-consuming.

Many existing methods usually require fine-grained supervisions (e.g., bounding-box annotations) to learn patch features, which requires a great effort to label images may limit their potential applications. In this paper, we propose to learn patch features via weak supervisions, i.e., only image-level supervisions. To achieve this goal, we treat images as bags and patches as instances to integrate the weakly supervised multiple instance learning constraints into deep neural networks. Also, our method integrates the traditional multiple stages of weakly supervised object classification and discovery into a unified deep convolutional neural network and optimizes the network in an end-to-end way. The network processes the two tasks object classification and discovery jointly, and shares hierarchical deep features. Through this jointly learning strategy, weakly supervised object classification and discovery are beneficial to each other. We test the proposed method on the challenging \{PASCAL\} \{VOC\} datasets. The results show that our method can obtain state-of-the-art performance on object classification, and very competitive results on object discovery, with faster testing speed than competitors. "}

This article presents a robust variational segmentation framework based on superpixelwise convolutional neutral network and a learned shape prior enabling an accurate analysis of overlapping cervical mass. The cellular components of Pap image are first classified by automatic feature learning and classification model. Then, a learning shape prior model is employed to delineate the actual contour of each individual cytoplasm inside the overlapping mass. The shape prior is dynamically modeled during the segmentation process as a weighted linear combination of shape templates from an over-complete shape dictionary under sparsity constraints. We provide quantitative and qualitative assessment of the proposed method using two databases of 153 cervical cytology images, with 870 cells in total, synthesised by accumulating real isolated cervical cells to generate overlapping cellular masses with a varying number of cells and degree of overlap. The experimental results have demonstrated that our methodology can successfully segment nuclei and cytoplasm from highly overlapping mass. Our segmentation is also competitive when compared to the state-of-the-art methods. "}

The design of existing estimators generally follows a same pipeline, i.e., an estimator is built from a given training dataset and then evaluated on a holdout testing set from the same dataset to display its effectiveness. In doing so, an implicit assumption is that both training and testing sets should share the same age distribution and feature representation, consequently-meaning that (1) once the age of a face image to be tested is outside the age range of training set, a mis-estimation is naturally inevitable; (2) an estimator built on a specific dataset usually cannot be directly applied to make evaluations on other datasets, because the dimensions and types of their feature representations are usually different (i.e., these datasets are heterogeneous). That is, existing methods can not be directly employed to perform cross-heterogeneous-dataset age estimation. To the best of our knowledge, the age distributions of existing aging datasets are usually not consistent but complementary to each other. Motivated by such a complementarity characteristic of different datasets in age distributions, we develop a so-called correlation component manifold space learning (CCMSL) to first learn a common feature space by capturing the correlations between the heterogeneous databases, and then in the resulting space establish a single age estimator across such heterogeneous datasets through correlation representation learning (CRL). As a result, not only can the age-distribution-incompleteness of individual aging datasets be compensated, but also the discriminating ability of the estimator be reinforced. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods. "}

First, multiple features are used to represent superpixels, and then measured by multiple distance metrics to construct multiple graphs. The motivation is to take advantage of their complementary information to cope with different environments. Second, fixation and boundary cues are respectively used as foreground and background seeds. The fixation is effective for crowded backgrounds because of the observation that regions within eye fixations are very likely the image foreground. Third, we integrate the multiple graphs and seeds into a regularized and optimized multi-graph based learning framework to effectively generate foreground-based and background-based saliency maps. Finally, we integrate these two saliency maps to obtain a more smooth and accurate saliency map. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed bottom-up saliency detection method yields comparable or better results against the state-of-the-art methods, and is robust to both cluttered and clean scenes.

The kernel of the proposed method is an “evolving” model that uses an unsupervised online learning scheme, in which an adaptive hidden Markov model (AHMM) is used for online learning the dynamic health changes of machines in their full life. A statistical index is developed for recognizing the new health states in the machines. Those new health states are then described online by adding of new hidden states in AHMM. Furthermore, the health degradations in machines are quantified online by an AHMM-based health index (HI) that measures the similarity between two density distributions that describe the historic and current health states, respectively. When necessary, the proposed method characterizes the distinct operating modes of the machine and can learn online both abrupt as well as gradual health changes. Our method overcomes some drawbacks of the \{HIs\} (e.g., relatively low comprehensibility and applicability) based on fixed monitoring models constructed in the offline phase. Results from its application in a bearing life test reveal that the proposed method is effective in online detection and adaptive assessment of machine health degradation. This study provides a useful guide for developing a condition-based maintenance (CBM) system that uses an online learning method without considerable human intervention. "}

Based on the relation graph, binary templates are transformed to describe vein characteristics of subjects. To ensure that templates are discriminative and representative, graph transform is formulated into an optimization problem, in which the distance between templates from different subjects is maximized and templates provide maximum information about subjects. At last, supervised information for training instances is provided by the obtained binary templates, and \{SVMs\} are trained as the code learner for each bit. Compared with existing binary codes for finger vein recognition, \{DBC\} are more discriminative and shorter. In addition, they are generated with considering the relationships among subjects which may be useful to improve performance.

While training an RBM, we need to sample from the model. The larger the mixing rate is, the smaller the bias of the samples is. However, neither Gibbs sampling based training methods such as Contrastive Divergence (CD) nor Parallel Tempering based training methods can achieve satisfying mixing rate, which causes poor rendering of the diversity of the modes captured by these trained models. This property may hinder the existing methods to approximate the likelihood gradient. In order to alleviate this problem, we attempt to introduce Tempered Transition, an advanced tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, into training \{RBMs\} to replace Gibbs sampling or Parallel Tempering for sampling from RBMs. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing methods to achieve better mixing rate and to help approximate the likelihood gradient.

The effect of both trained and general ConvNets features for our scene labeling framework are investigated. Then, based on the predicted posteriors from the learned features, we propose an algorithm called Region Consistency Activation (RCA) to iteratively improve the global label consistency at different levels of the Ultrametric Contour Map (UCM). In addition, we propose a strategy to make the hyper-parameters of \{RCA\} adaptive to the test images, which results in a better generalization ability compared with the hyper-parameters tuning based RCA. Our scene labeling framework were rigorously tested on three popular scene labeling datasets: Stanford Background, \{SIFT\} Flow and NYU-Depth V2.

As the classification measure, a set of errors is further obtained through the comparison between the test beat and the estimators constructed by the \{RBF\} networks. \{ECG\} records taken from the MIT-BIH (Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital) arrhythmia database are selected to test the proposed method.

abstract = {"Abstract Prevalent hardware trends towards parallel architectures and algorithms create a growing demand for graduate students familiar with the programming of concurrent software. However, learning parallel programming is challenging due to complex communication and memory access patterns as well as the avoidance of common pitfalls such as dead-locks and race conditions.

Current state-of-the-art recovery algorithms exploit both spatial and temporal sparsity in dMRI to improve the reconstruction quality. In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm based on 4-frame parallel dictionary learning and dynamic total variation (PDLDTV) for real-time dMRI reconstruction. The dMRI sequence was decomposed into 4-frame subsets and each subset included the first frame (obtained with more k-space sampling for reference to later frames) and any adjacent three frames. A 3D patch-based dictionary learning algorithm and a dynamic total variation algorithm were used to exploit the spatiotemporal sparsity in each subset. High algorithm speed was required for our real-time reconstruction, and a primal-dual algorithm was used to solve the challenging problem. Experiments over two cardiac dMRI sequences indicated that the proposed 4-frame \{PDLDTV\} showed better reconstruction performance than the state-of-the-art online and offline methods such as DTV, k-t SLR, and DLTG.

In this paper, in order to address this issue, we use a learning system, linear guided autoencoder (LGAE) we call, which consists of an autoencoder and a linear predictor. For the autoencoder, we adopt a variant of the denoising autoencoder. In the LGAE, the learning addresses the unsupervised and supervised tasks simultaneously. Thus, the \{LGAE\} can be regarded as a form of nonlinear partial least squares (PLS) regression. Previous studies have not found the optimal solution for the encoder for an objective that contains both tasks. Our main contributions are a first-order approximation of the optimal solution and determination of the condition for linear solution that applies to the \{LGAE\} after training, in order to acquire knowledge from the nonlinear model (i.e., the LGAE). The main drawback of nonlinear \{PLS\} regression is that it is difficult to interpret the latent representation. Therefore, we propose a technical method for interpreting the latent representation. Experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted in order to compare the \{LGAE\} with kernel \{PLS\} regression, which is a powerful nonlinear \{PLS\} regression method. We also applied the \{LGAE\} to a dataset of methane storage materials in order to interpret the methane uptake based on the input variables and obtained reasonable results. "}

abstract = {"Abstract The ability to recognize pedestrians across multiple camera views is of great importance for many applications in the broad field of video surveillance. Due to the absence of the topology and calibration of distributed cameras, spatio-temporal reasoning becomes unavailable, and therefore only appearance information can be used in real-world scenarios, especially for disjoint camera views. This paper proposes a novel approach based on important salient feature and multi-category transfer incremental learning to recognize pedestrians for long-term tracking in multi-camera networks without space-time cues. An accurate and robust model can be built for pedestrian recognition using few samples. We first propose a novel multi-level important salient feature detection method (MImSF11 \{MImSF\} is the abbreviation of Multi-level Important Salient Feature detection method ) to formulate the appearance model. Due to environmental changes, the appearances of the pedestrians under the camera can change over time and across space, therefore the classification performance may be impaired. Hence, the appearance models should be continuously updated. We then adopt a novel object recognition multicategory incremental modeling algorithm (ORMIM22 \{ORMIM\} is the abbreviation of Object Recognition Multicategory Incremental Modeling algorithm ) to update the appearance model adaptively and recognize the pedestrians based on a classification approach. One of the major advantages of the proposed method is that it can identify new target objects that were never learned in the primary model while improving the matching accuracy of what has been learned. We conduct extensive experiments on CAVIAR, \{ISCAPS\} databases and our own databases where the camera views are disjoint and the appearance of objects changes significantly due to variations in the camera viewpoint, illumination, weather and poses. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to that of existing classification-based recognition methods in terms of accuracy, robustness and computation efficiency. The developed methodology can be used in retrieval, matching and other real-time video surveillance applications. "}

The proposed algorithm is an extension of eSS with three important improvements in terms of: reference set (RefSet) formation, RefSet combination, and RefSet intensification. Due to the difficulty in estimating kinetic parameter values in the presence of noise and large number of parameters (high-dimension), the aforementioned eSS mechanisms have been improved using combination of quasi-opposition and quasi-reflection, which were under the family of opposition-based learning scheme. The proposed algorithm is tested using one set of benchmark function each from large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problem as well as parameter estimation problem. The \{LSGO\} problem consists of 11 functions with 1000 dimensions. For parameter estimation, around 116 kinetic parameters in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and central carbon metabolism of E. coli are estimated. The results revealed that the proposed algorithm is superior to eSS and other competitive algorithms in terms of its efficiency in minimizing objective function value and having faster convergence rate. The proposed algorithm also required lower computational resources, especially number of function evaluations performed and computation time. In addition, the estimated kinetic parameter values obtained from the proposed algorithm produced the best fit to a set of experimental data. "}

Moreover, the ignorance of some specific constraints including positional constraints, zoning constraints and synchronism constraints will result in the invalidation of the schedule. To solve this stochastic two-sided assembly line balancing problem with multiple constraints, we propose a hybrid teaching-learning-based optimization (HTLBO) approach which combines both a novel teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm for global search and a variable neighborhood search with seven neighborhood operators for local search. Especially, a new priority-based decoding approach is developed to ensure that the selected tasks satisfy most of the constraints identified by multiple thresholds of the priority value and to reduce the idle times related to sequence-dependence among tasks. Experimental results on benchmark problems demonstrate both remarkable efficiency and universality of the developed decoding approach, and the comparison among 11 algorithms shows the effectiveness of the proposed HTLBO.

Specifically, the architecture of neural networks is established by embracing hand-crafted features within a data-driven learning framework, incorporating both spatial and temporal information sustained by the video images of the moving heart and giving rise to two strands of two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN). In particular, the acceleration measurement along the time direction at each point is calculated using dense optical flow technique to represent temporal motion information. Subsequently, the fusion of both networks is conducted via linear integrations of the vectors of class scores obtained from each of the two networks.

Currently such performance is assessed using Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather files. \{TMY3\} is the latest \{TMY\} file introduced by Department of Energy (DOE) and it represents the historical 30-year average of weather data more closely than any other available datasets. However, \{TMY3\} data reflects the past and do not accurately forecast weather information thus leading to erroneous estimation of performance and economic feasibility. Therefore, more accurate methods are necessary to generate weather files so as to design buildings for sustainability and resilience. This article proposes an effective hybrid modeling methodology based on support vector machine regression and probability estimation to predict long term future weather variables. The methodology has been validated by using a dataset containing historical solar irradiance data for 54 years (1961–2014) for Cincinnati, Ohio. By implementing the proposed technique multiple models were trained with different segments of the dataset, which were used to predict the hourly solar irradiance for 8, 9, 10 and 11 years respectively. Subsequently, the predicted data and the current \{TMY3\} data was compared with the actual historical data. The average increase in accuracy of the predicted over \{TMY3\} direct normal and diffuse horizontal components of solar irradiance was found to be 38.43% and 11.8%. These findings suggest that the long term accuracy of the proposed modeling technique is greater than the current state-of-the-art. "}

However, those solutions are case-specific resulting to increased set-up effort. This work proposes a universal \{RLMPPT\} control method based on a reinforcement learning (RL) method that tracks and adjusts the maximum power point of a photovoltaic source without any prior knowledge. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) model for the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) photovoltaic process is defined and an \{RL\} algorithm is proposed and evaluated on a number of photovoltaic sources. The proposed \{RLMPPT\} control method has the advantage of being applicable to different \{PV\} sources with minimum set-up time. To evaluate the \{RLMPPT\} control method performance, a number of simulations run under different environmental and operating conditions and a comparison with the conventional method of Perturb and Observe (P&amp;O) is performed. Results show quick response and close to optimal behavior without requiring any prior knowledge. "}

We report the results of two behavioral experiments. In each trial of the experiments, the participant must accumulate noisy information to make a decision. The participants received positive and negative rewards for their correct and incorrect decisions, respectively. The stimulus was designed such that decisions based on more accumulated information were more accurate but took longer. Therefore, the total outcome that a participant could achieve during the limited experiments’ time depended on her “decision threshold”, the amount of information she needed to make a decision. In the first experiment, two types of trials were intermixed randomly: hard and easy. Crucially, the hard trials were associated with smaller positive and negative rewards than the easy trials. A cue presented at the beginning of each trial would indicate the type of the upcoming trial. The optimal strategy was to adopt a small decision threshold for hard trials. The results showed that several of the participants did not learn this simple strategy. We then investigated how the participants adjusted their decision threshold based on the feedback they received in each trial. To this end, we developed and compared 10 computational models for adjusting the decision threshold. The models differ in their assumptions on the shape of the decision thresholds and the way the feedback is used to adjust the decision thresholds. The results of Bayesian model comparison showed that a model with time-varying thresholds whose parameters are updated by a reinforcement learning algorithm is the most likely model. In the second experiment, the cues were not presented. We showed that the optimal strategy is to use a single time-decreasing decision threshold for all trials. The results of the computational modeling showed that the participants did not use this optimal strategy. Instead, they attempted to detect the difficulty of the trial first and then set their decision threshold accordingly. "}

In order to overcome this difficulty, firstly, we propose a model-based simultaneous policy update algorithm to learn the solution of \{HJI\} equation iteratively and provide its convergence proof. Then, based on this model-based method, we develop a data-driven model-free algorithm, which only requires the real system sampling data generated by arbitrary different control inputs and external disturbances instead of accurate system models, and prove that these two algorithms are equivalent. To implement this model-free algorithm, three neural networks (NNs) are employed to approximate the iterative performance index function, control policy and disturbance policy, respectively, and the least-square approach is used to minimize the \{NN\} approximation residual errors. Finally, the proposed scheme is tested on the rotational/translational actuator nonlinear system. "}

However, in the meantime, these platforms are prone to be potentially attacked by spammers, who usually propagate disgusted information such as phishing URLs, false news, and even pornography to other users. Despite rapid increase of social media spammers, the traditional spammer detection methods become less effective. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised social media spammer detection approach, making full use of the message content and user behavior as well as the social relation information. First, we adapt the original constrained NMF-based semi-supervised learning (CNMF) algorithm, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) by imposing a label information constrain and sparseness constrain. Second, we present a novel CNMF-based integral framework for social media spammer detection by implementing the collaborative factorization on the message content matrix and the user behavior and social relation information matrix. Moreover, we explore the iterative update rule (IUR) and optimization algorithm for the spammer detection model. In addition, its corresponding convergence is also proven. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real-world dataset from Sina Weibo, the experiment results demonstrate that our proposed model performs significantly better than the conventionally applied supervised classifiers for the spammer detection.

abstract = {"Abstract In this study, we propose two analysis dictionary learning algorithms for sparse representation with analysis model. The problem is formulated with the ℓ1-norm regularizer and with two penalty terms on the analysis dictionary: the term of − log det ( Ω T Ω ) and the coherence penalty term. As the processing scheme, we employ a block coordinate descent framework, so that the overall problem is transformed into a set of minimizations of univariate subproblems with respect to a single-vector variable. Each subproblem is still nonsmooth, but it can be solved by a proximal operator and then the closed-form solutions can be obtained directly and explicitly. In particular, the coherence penalty, excluding excessively similar or repeated dictionary atoms, is solved at the same time as the dictionary update, thereby reducing the complexity. Furthermore, a scheme with a group of atoms is introduced in one proposed algorithm, which has a lower complexity. According to our analysis and simulation study, the main advantages of the proposed algorithms are their greater dictionary recovery ratios especially in the low-cosparsity case, and their faster running time of reaching the stable values of the dictionary recovery ratios and the recovery cosparsity compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, one proposed algorithm performs well in image denoising and in noise cancellation. "}

Three discriminant features are specified in raw samples and two morphological features, which can complement the \{MKL\} of a \{P300\} classification. A linear kernel is established for each discriminant feature. A kernel weight differentiates the linear kernel to both explore complementary information among the three discriminant features and weigh a contribution of each discriminant feature for the MKL. Here, the ℓ1 norm regularization of the kernel weight ultimately enforces an optimal discriminant feature set of the \{MKL\} of a \{P300\} classification. The performance of the proposed method is then evaluated according to the size of the three discriminant feature sets that are generated from dataset \{II\} of \{BCI\} competition III. Compared to an existing SVM-based classification method, the proposed method consistently obtains better or similar accuracy in terms of character recognition, with a different execution time for the variable size of the three discriminant feature sets. Furthermore, the kernel weight of the raw samples was found to consistently be more dominant than the kernel weight of the two morphological features on the variable size of the three discriminant feature sets. This finding means that the two morphological features supplement the lack of the raw samples for the \{MKL\} of a \{P300\} classification. We ultimately could conclude that the proposed method is sufficiently robust to improve the accuracy of character recognition with a different time for the variable size of the three discriminant feature sets in a \{P300\} speller BCI.

The proposed controller can be divided into two parts: (1) optimal control policy of the fault-free systems and (2) fault compensator. Firstly, a model-based policy iteration algorithm is introduced to obtain the optimal control law. Subsequently, a fault compensator is derived to get rid of the impact of the actuator fault. The stability analysis of the model-based control scheme is presented by using Lyapunov theory. However, for the complex practical systems, system models are generally unavailable, and thus the model-based approaches may be invalid. To overcome this difficulty, we provide a data-driven reinforcement learning method and an identification approach to design the two parts of the proposed controller, respectively, without any knowledge of the system models. Neural networks are employed to implement these two data-based methods. Finally, two simulation examples are shown in details to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. "}

We recorded local field potentials from the \{CA1\} alveus in acute mouse neocortico-hippocampal slices, while 14 drugs were bath-perfused at 5 different concentrations each. For each experimental condition, we collected seizure-like neuronal activity and merged their waveforms as one graphic image, which was further converted into a feature vector using Caffe, an open framework for deep learning. In the space of the first two principal components, the support vector machine completely separated the vectors (i.e., doses of individual drugs) that induced seizure-like events and identified diphenhydramine, enoxacin, strychnine and theophylline as “seizure-inducing” drugs, which indeed were reported to induce seizures in clinical situations. Thus, this artificial intelligence-based classification may provide a new platform to detect the seizure-inducing side effects of preclinical drugs. "}

It is considered as one of the most promising 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced technologies for improving the spectrum and energy efficiency of Proximity-based Services (ProSe). However, due to interference posed by the \{D2D\} transmitters to the primary cellular users, intelligent resource allocation techniques need to be incorporated for the betterment of the overall system. Overlay \{D2D\} communication avoids the interference between cellular and \{D2D\} users by dedicating resources for \{D2D\} users. With this approach, efficient use of the dedicated Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) among \{D2D\} users is still a concern. To handle the issue of optimum spectral efficiency, efficient allocation of spectrum resources is essential among \{D2D\} users. For the first time, we address this problem and propose a \{PRB\} allocation scheme that maximizes the \{PRB\} utilization among \{D2D\} users. The proposed scheme spreads the \{PRB\} requirement of a \{D2D\} pair over multiple \{PRBs\} while reducing the transmit power over each PRB, thereby reducing the overall interference and improving the spectral efficiency of the network. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our scheme does better than the conventional \{PRB\} allocation scheme (of assigning \{PRBs\} based on their data rate demand), by increasing the overall throughput and energy efficiency of the network. To analytically evaluate the proposed \{PRB\} allocation scheme, we present a stochastic geometry based framework to analyze the coverage and average rate of the network, and conclude that the link \{SINR\} of the \{D2D\} pairs is actually improved on employing our proposed scheme which results in high coverage and overall rate of the system. Finally, we propose a Q-Learning algorithm that learns the optimum number of \{PRBs\} to dedicate for overlay \{D2D\} communication based on the \{PRB\} demand of the cellular and \{D2D\} users. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm efficiently allocates \{PRBs\} to the \{D2D\} pairs when compared to the conventional static scheme of dedicating fixed number of PRBs. "}

While attention to this problem has been growing, there remains an urgent need to develop novel strategies in the field of “digital epidemiology” to better identify, analyze and understand trends in \{NMUPD\} behavior. Methods We conducted surveillance of the popular microblogging site Twitter by collecting 11 million tweets filtered for three commonly abused prescription opioid analgesic drugs Percocet® (acetaminophen/oxycodone), OxyContin® (oxycodone), and Oxycodone. Unsupervised machine learning was applied on the subset of tweets for each analgesic drug to discover underlying latent themes regarding risk behavior. A two-step process of obtaining themes, and filtering out unwanted tweets was carried out in three subsequent rounds of machine learning. Results Using this methodology, 2.3M tweets were identified that contained content relevant to analgesic NMUPD. The underlying themes were identified for each drug and the most representative tweets of each theme were annotated for \{NMUPD\} behavioral risk factors. The primary themes identified evidence high levels of social media discussion about polydrug abuse on Twitter. This included specific mention of various polydrug combinations including use of other classes of prescription drugs, and illicit drug abuse. Conclusions This study presents a methodology to filter Twitter content for \{NMUPD\} behavior, while also identifying underlying themes with minimal human intervention. Results from the study track accurately with the inclusion/exclusion criteria used to isolate NMUPD-related risk behaviors of interest and also provides insight on \{NMUPD\} behavior that has a high level of social media engagement. Results suggest that this could be a viable methodology for use in big data substance abuse surveillance, data collection, and analysis in comparison to other studies that rely upon content analysis and human coding schemes.

However, an ELM-LRF model with large number of hidden neurons spend plenty of time on solving large scale Moore-Penrose Matrix Inversion (MPMI) problem which has heavy computational cost and needs much more runtime memory. Moreover, this procedure can not be directly accelerated by \{GPU\} platforms due to the limited memory of \{GPU\} devices.

First we propose a novel blocked \{LU\} decomposition algorithm, which overcomes the limitation of global memory size so that any size of ELM-LRF models can be trained. Furthermore, an efficient blocked Cholesky decomposition algorithm is presented to accelerate blocked \{LU\} decomposition algorithm according to matrix characteristics in the ELM-LRF model. Finally we present a heterogeneous blocked CPU-GPU parallel algorithm to fully exploit resources on a \{GPU\} node such as to accelerate blocked Cholesky decomposition algorithm furthermore in the ELM-LRF model.

Through the estimates of the model, we examine behavioral differences among individuals due to different levels of WMC. In accordance with ‘Miller’s magic number’, which is the constraint of working memory capacity, we consider two different sizes (granularities) of strategy space: one is larger (finer) and one is smaller (coarser). We find that constraining the \{EWA\} models by using levels (granules) within the limits of working memory allows for a better characterization of the data based on individual differences in WMC. Using this level-reinforcement version of \{EWA\} learning, also referred to as the \{EWA\} rule learning model, we find that working memory capacity can significantly affect learning behavior. Our likelihood ratio test rejects the null that subjects with high \{WMC\} and subjects with low \{WMC\} follow the same \{EWA\} learning model. In addition, the parameter corresponding to ‘counterfactual thinking ability’ is found to be reduced when working memory capacity is low. "}

Second, the SVM-RFE is enhanced by using binary dragonfly (BDF), which is a recently developed metaheuristic that has never been benchmarked in the context of feature selection. The objective function is the average of classification accuracy rate generated by three kernel-based learning methods.

Finding the location and size of an eye-pair in an image containing a face can enable a face recognition application to extract features from a face corresponding to different entities. Furthermore, it allows us to align different faces, so that more accurate recognition results can be obtained. To the best of our knowledge, currently there is only one eye-pair detector, which is a part of the Viola–Jones object detection framework. However, as we will show in this paper, this eye-pair detector is not very accurate for detecting eye-pairs from different face images. Therefore, in this paper we describe several novel eye-pair detection methods based on different feature extraction methods and a support vector machine (SVM) to classify image patches as containing an eye-pair or not. To find the location of an eye-pair on unseen test images, a sliding window approach is used, and the location and size of the window giving the highest output of the \{SVM\} classifier are returned. We have tested the different methods on three different datasets: the IMM, the Caltech and the Indian face dataset. The results show that the linear restricted Boltzmann machine feature extraction technique and principal component analysis result in the best performances. The \{SVM\} with these feature extraction methods is able to very accurately detect eye-pairs. Furthermore, the results show that our best eye-pair detection methods perform much better than the Viola–Jones eye-pair detector. "}

However, the labelling of the training set is time-consuming, especially as datasets grow in size and complexity. Furthermore, this approach is not applicable to the home user, who wants to intuitively group their media without tirelessly labelling the content. Consequently, we propose a solution similar in nature to an active learning paradigm, where a small subset of media is labelled as semantically belonging to the same class, and machine learning is then used to pull this and other related content together in the feature space. Our interactive approach is able to iteratively cluster classes of images and video. We reformulate it in an online learning framework and demonstrate competitive performance to batch learning approaches using only a fraction of the labelled data. Our approach is based around the concept of an image signature which, unlike a standard bag of words model, can express co-occurrence statistics as well as symbol frequency. We efficiently compute metric distances between signatures despite their inherent high dimensionality and provide discriminative feature selection, to allow common and distinctive elements to be identified from a small set of user labelled examples. These elements are then accentuated in the image signature to increase similarity between examples and pull correct classes together. By repeating this process in an online learning framework, the accuracy of similarity increases dramatically despite labelling only a few training examples. To demonstrate that the approach is agnostic to media type and features used, we evaluate on three image datasets (15 scene, Caltech101 and FG-NET), a mixed text and image dataset (ImageTag), a dataset used in active learning (Iris) and on three action recognition datasets (UCF11, \{KTH\} and Hollywood2). On the \{UCF11\} video dataset, the accuracy is 86.7% despite using only 90 labelled examples from a dataset of over 1200 videos, instead of the standard 1122 training videos. The approach is both scalable and efficient, with a single iteration over the full \{UCF11\} dataset of around 1200 videos taking approximately 1 min on a standard desktop machine. "}

abstract = {"Abstract The hydrologic processes of wetting and drying play a crucial role in agricultural activities involving heavy equipment on unpaved terrain. When soil conditions moisten, equipment can become mired, causing expensive delays. While experienced users may assess soil conditions before entering off-road areas, novice users or those who must remotely assess sites before traveling may have difficulty assessing conditions reliably. One means of assessing dryness is remotely-monitored in situ sensors. Unfortunately, land owners hesitate to place sensors due to monetary costs, complexity, and sometimes infeasibility of physical visits to remote locations. This work addresses these limitations by modeling the wetting/drying process through machine learning algorithms fed by hydrologic data – remotely assessing soil conditions using only publicly-accessible information. Classification trees, k-nearest-neighbors, and boosted perceptrons deliver statistical soil dryness estimates at a site located in Urbana, IL. The k-nearest-neighbor and boosted perceptron algorithms both performed with 91–94% accuracy, with most misclassifications falling within calculated margins of error. These analyses demonstrate that reasonably accurate predictions of current soil conditions are possible with only precipitation and potential evaporation data. These two values are measured throughout the continental United States and are likely to be available globally from satellite sensors in the near future. Through this type of approach, agricultural management decisions can be enabled remotely, without the time and expense of on-site visitations or extensive ground-based sensory grids. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Dynamic ensemble selection (DES) techniques work by estimating the competence level of each classifier from a pool of classifiers, and selecting only the most competent ones for the classification of a specific test sample. The key issue in \{DES\} is defining a suitable criterion for calculating the classifiers’ competence. There are several criteria available to measure the level of competence of base classifiers, such as local accuracy estimates and ranking. However, using only one criterion may lead to a poor estimation of the classifier’s competence. In order to deal with this issue, we have proposed a novel dynamic ensemble selection framework using meta-learning, called META-DES. A meta-classifier is trained, based on the meta-features extracted from the training data, to estimate the level of competence of a classifier for the classification of a given query sample. An important aspect of the META-DES framework is that multiple criteria can be embedded in the system encoded as different sets of meta-features. However, some \{DES\} criteria are not suitable for every classification problem. For instance, local accuracy estimates may produce poor results when there is a high degree of overlap between the classes. Moreover, a higher classification accuracy can be obtained if the performance of the meta-classifier is optimized for the corresponding data. In this paper, we propose a novel version of the META-DES framework based on the formal definition of the Oracle, called META-DES.Oracle. The Oracle is an abstract method that represents an ideal classifier selection scheme. A meta-feature selection scheme using an overfitting cautious Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) is proposed for improving the performance of the meta-classifier. The difference between the outputs obtained by the meta-classifier and those presented by the Oracle is minimized. Thus, the meta-classifier is expected to obtain results that are similar to the Oracle. Experiments carried out using 30 classification problems demonstrate that the optimization procedure based on the Oracle definition leads to a significant improvement in classification accuracy when compared to previous versions of the META-DES framework and other state-of-the-art \{DES\} techniques.

LBP-like texture classification methods usually follow a two-step feature extraction process: in the first pattern encoding step, the local structure information around each pixel is encoded into a binary string; in the second histogram accumulation step, the binary strings are accumulated into a histogram as the feature vector of a texture image. The performances of these classification methods are closely related to the distinctiveness of the feature vectors. In this paper, we propose a novel feature representation method, namely Completed Discriminative Local Features (CDLF), for texture classification. The proposed \{CDLF\} improves the distinctiveness of LBP-like feature vectors in two aspects: in the pattern encoding stage, we learn a transformation matrix using labeled data, which significantly increases the discrimination power of the encoded binary strings; in the histogram accumulation step, we use an adaptive weight strategy to consider the contributions of pixels in different regions. The experimental results on three challenging texture databases demonstrate that the proposed \{CDLF\} achieves significantly better results than previous LBP-like feature representation methods for texture classification tasks.

Study of the statics of the system shows that compact CuN (3≤N≤8) clusters made up of triangular units on fcc occupancy sites are the energetically most stable structures of those clusters. Interestingly, we find a correlation between the height of the activation energy barrier (Ea) and the location of the transition state (TS). The Ea of processes for Cu islands on the Ni(111) surface are in general smaller than those of their counterpart Ni islands on the same surface. We find this difference to correlate with the relative strength of the lateral interaction of the island atoms in the two systems. While our database consists of hundreds of possible processes, we identify and discuss the energetics of those that are the most dominant, or are rate-limiting, or most contributory to the diffusion of the islands. Since the Ea of single- and multi-atom processes that convert compact island shapes into non-compact ones are larger (with a significantly smaller Ea for their reverse processes) than that for the collective (concerted) motion of the island, the later dominate in the system kinetics -- except for the cases of the dimer, pentamer and octamer. Short-jump involving one atom, long jump dimer-shearing, and long-jump corner shearing (via a single-atom) are, respectively, the dominating processes in the diffusion of the dimer, pentamer and octamer. Furthermore single-atom corner-rounding are the rate-limiting processes for the pentamer and octamer islands. Comparison of the energetics of selected processes and lateral interactions obtained from semi-empirical interatomic potentials with those from density functional theory show minor quantitative differences and overall qualitative agreement.

However, the existing MatCD might not be able to acquire the prior distribution knowledge, such as the relationship between two patterns. Inspired by the Pairwise Constraints (PC) method, i.e., must-links and cannot-links between the patterns, this paper introduces a new regularization term named Rp with a modified \{PC\} method into MatCD. The new classifier design strategy is expected to not only learn the structural information of each pattern itself, but also acquire the prior distribution knowledge about each constrained pair with both the discrimination metric from the traditional \{PC\} and the spatial distance measure from the heat kernel method. In practice, this paper selects one typical matrixized classifier named MatMHKS as the basic building block and introduces the term Rp into it. The newly-proposed classifier is named \{MLMMPC\} and the subsequent experiments validate the effectiveness of it. Two major contributions of this paper can be concluded as (1) improving the existing matrix-pattern-oriented classifier design techniques and (2) modifying the traditional \{PC\} method by combining the discrimination metric and the distance measure together.

In the present work two existing feature selection/extraction algorithms, namely independent component analysis (ICA) and fuzzy backward feature elimination (FBFE) are used which is a new combination of selection/extraction. The main objective of this paper is to select the independent components of the \{DNA\} microarray data using \{FBFE\} to improve the performance of support vector machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, while making the computational expenses affordable. To show the validity of the proposed method, it is applied to reduce the number of genes for five \{DNA\} microarray datasets namely; colon cancer, acute leukemia, prostate cancer, lung cancer II, and high-grade glioma. Now these datasets are then classified using \{SVM\} and \{NB\} classifiers. Experimental results on these five microarray datasets demonstrate that gene selected by proposed approach, effectively improve the performance of \{SVM\} and \{NB\} classifiers in terms of classification accuracy. We compare our proposed method with principal component analysis (PCA) as a standard extraction algorithm and find that the proposed method can obtain better classification accuracy, using \{SVM\} and \{NB\} classifiers with a smaller number of selected genes than the PCA. The curve between the average error rate and number of genes with each dataset represents the selection of required number of genes for the highest accuracy with our proposed method for both the classifiers. \{ROC\} shows best subset of genes for both the classifier of different datasets with propose method.

These variables have significant impact on the cumulative tailpipe emissions ( H C c u m ) during a coldstart phenomenon, which is the number one emission-related problem for today's spark-ignited (SI) engine vehicles. To do so, the concepts of ensemble computing with negative correlation learning (NCL) and pruning of neurons are used in tandem to cope with difficulties associated with extracting knowledge from collected database. In the proposed framework, the regularization strategies are adopted to help us increasing the numerical stability of identifier while mitigating the redundant complexity of hidden neurons. Moreover, to increase the generalization of identifier and also reduce the effects of uncertainty, an ensemble of independent OP-ELM with \{NCL\} selection criterion called OP-ELM-ER-NCL is taken into account. To endorse the valid performance of OP-ELM-ER-NCL for modeling the characteristics of engine over the coldstart phenomenon, its performance is compared to a set of well-known identification systems, i.e. standard extreme learning machine (ELM), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), OP-ELM with different types of regularization, ensemble of regularized OP-ELM without negative correlation (OP-ELM-ER), and an ensemble \{ELM\} with a constrained linear system of leave-one-out outputs (E-LL), in terms of both accuracy and computational complexity. The simulation results indicate that the proposed identifier is really capable of capturing the knowledge of collected database. It is observed that its resulted accuracy and robustness are comparable with those obtained by identification methods available in the literature. Besides, using \{NCL\} strategy aids the ensemble to select the most effective regularization techniques and remove the redundant (ineffective) ones, which consequently decreases the complexity of final ensemble.

The most appropriate tool to solve problems of classification, by considering the aptitude, would be the k-Nearest Neighbours used in a hierarchical model. For the first level of this hierarchy, the study was conducted using a 1-Nearest Neighbour classification of individuals by aptitude, and on the second level, the breeds were analysed again using three new 1-Nearest Neighbour classifiers, one for each aptitude. The results obtained improved the accuracy rates for assigning individuals to breed, compared with those usually employed using Linear Discriminant Analysis methodologies.

However, because the ‘exploration tendency’ in most previous studies has been measured without considering the information-gathering processes, it is yet hard to conclude that the animal asocial exploration strategies may be tied to social information use. Here, we studied human learning behaviour in both asocial and social two-armed bandit tasks. By fitting reinforcement learning models including asocial and/or social decision processes, we measured each individual's (1) asocial exploration tendency and (2) social information use. We found consistent individual differences in the exploration tendency in the asocial tasks. We also found substantive heterogeneity in the adopted learning strategies in the social task: Nearly one-third of participants used predominantly the copy-when-uncertain strategy, while the remaining two-thirds were most likely to have relied only on asocial learning. However, we found no significant individual association between the exploration frequency in the asocial task and the use of the social information in the social task. Our results suggest that the social learning strategies may be independent from the asocial exploration strategies in humans. "}

The obtained results indicate that it is feasible to predict these fats with a high degree of correlation, thus alleviating the requirement for manual or automatic segmentation of both fat volumes. Instead, segmenting just one of them suffices, while the volume of the other may be predicted fairly precisely. The correlation coefficient obtained by the Rotation Forest algorithm using \{MLP\} Regressor for predicting the mediastinal fat based on the epicardial fat was 0.9876, with a relative absolute error of 14.4% and a root relative squared error of 15.7%. The best correlation coefficient obtained in the prediction of the epicardial fat based on the mediastinal was 0.9683 with a relative absolute error of 19.6% and a relative squared error of 24.9%. Moreover, we analysed the feasibility of using linear regressors, which provide an intuitive interpretation of the underlying approximations. In this case, the obtained correlation coefficient was 0.9534 for predicting the mediastinal fat based on the epicardial, with a relative absolute error of 31.6% and a root relative squared error of 30.1%. On the prediction of the epicardial fat based on the mediastinal fat, the correlation coefficient was 0.8531, with a relative absolute error of 50.43% and a root relative squared error of 52.06%. In summary, it is possible to speed up general medical analyses and some segmentation and quantification methods that are currently employed in the state-of-the-art by using this prediction approach, which consequently reduces costs and therefore enables preventive treatments that may lead to a reduction of health problems.

abstract = {"Abstract Load demand forecasting is a critical process in the planning of electric utilities. An ensemble method composed of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm and deep learning approach is presented in this work. For this purpose, the load demand series were first decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then a Deep Belief Network (DBN) including two restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) was used to model each of the extracted IMFs, so that the tendencies of these \{IMFs\} can be accurately predicted. Finally, the prediction results of all \{IMFs\} can be combined by either unbiased or weighted summation to obtain an aggregated output for load demand. The electricity load demand data sets from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed EMD-based \{DBN\} approach. Simulation results demonstrated attractiveness of the proposed method compared with nine forecasting methods. "}

Hence, prediction of the maximum scour depth is of great importance for the protection of these structures. Since scour is the result of a complicated interaction between structure, sediment, and incoming waves, empirical equations are not as accurate as machine learning schemes, which are being widely employed for the coastal engineering modeling. In this paper, which can be regarded as an extension of Pourzangbar et al. (2016), two soft computing methods, a support vector regression (SVR), and a model tree algorithm (M5′), have been implemented to predict the maximum scour depth due to non-breaking waves. The models predict the relative scour depth (Smax/H0) on the basis of the following variables: relative water depth at the toe of the breakwater (htoe/L0), Shields parameter (θ), non-breaking wave steepness (H0/L0), and reflection coefficient (Cr). 95 laboratory data points, extracted from dedicated experimental studies, have been used for developing the models, whose performances have been assessed on the basis of statistical parameters. The results suggest that all of the developed models predict the maximum scour depth with high precision, the M5′ model performed marginally better than the \{SVR\} model and also allowed to define a set of transparent and physically sound relationships. Such relationships, which are in good agreement with the existing empirical findings, show that the relative scour depth is mainly affected by wave reflection. "}

In such \{HELM\} implementations, the extended \{ELM\} provides better generalization performance during the learning process. Moreover, the proposed extended \{ELM\} method is efficient not only for \{HFNNs\} with sigmoid hidden nodes but also for \{HFNNs\} with radial basis function (RBF) hidden nodes. Finally, the \{HELM\} is applied to the activated sludge wastewater treatment processes (WWTPs) for predicting the water qualities. Experimental results and the performance comparison demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HELM. "}

Current \{EWS\} leverage only a small fraction of Electronic Health Record (EHR) content. The planned widespread implementation of \{EHRs\} brings the promise of abundant data resources for prediction purposes. The three specific aims of our research are: (1) to develop an EHR-based automated algorithm to predict the need for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) transfer in the first 24 h of admission; (2) to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm on a held-out test data set; and (3) to compare the effectiveness of the new algorithm's with those of two published Pediatric Early Warning Scores (PEWS). Methods The cases were comprised of 526 encounters with 24-h Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) transfer. In addition to the cases, we randomly selected 6772 control encounters from 62516 inpatient admissions that were never transferred to the PICU. We used 29 variables in a logistic regression and compared our algorithm against two published \{PEWS\} on a held-out test data set. Results The logistic regression algorithm achieved 0.849 (95% \{CI\} 0.753–0.945) sensitivity, 0.859 (95% \{CI\} 0.850–0.868) specificity and 0.912 (95% \{CI\} 0.905–0.919) area under the curve (AUC) in the test set. Our algorithm's \{AUC\} was significantly higher, by 11.8 and 22.6% in the test set, than two published PEWS.

However, traditional methods including image segmentation based methods, feature based methods and shallow classifier based methods cannot meet the requirements of highly accurate. These methods are composed with several separating steps, i.e. feature selection and recognition. This paper proposes a novel deep learning based method to identify furnace combustion state and measure heat release rate. With an end-to-end network, feature extraction and classification are integrated into one framework. The deep learning model takes flame images into a multi-layer \{DNN\} (Deep Neural Network) or \{CNN\} (Convolutional Neural Network) to predict combustion state and heat release rate simultaneously. We also implement smooth and adjustment techniques which can get a trade-off between stability and sensitivity, ensuring both accurate prediction of burner state and fast detection of unstable combustion. The proposed system achieved state-of-the-art 99.9% accuracy in predicting combustion state with a speed of 1ms per image. Experimental results show that this method has great potential for practical applications on power plants. "}

Method We applied machine learning, specifically a combination of mutual information-based feature selection and supervised learning classifiers on multimodal data, to predict surgery outcome retrospectively in 20 presurgical patients (13 female; mean age±SD, in years 33±9.7 for females, and 35.3±9.4 for males) who were diagnosed with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and subsequently underwent standard anteromesial temporal lobectomy. The main advantage of the present work over previous studies is the inclusion of the extent of ipsilateral neocortical gray matter atrophy and spatiotemporal properties of depth electrode-recorded seizures as training features for individual patient surgery planning. Results A maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) feature selector identified the following features as the most informative predictors of postsurgical seizure freedom in this study’s sample of patients: family history of epilepsy, ictal \{EEG\} onset pattern (positive correlation with seizure freedom), MRI-based gray matter thickness reduction in the hemisphere ipsilateral to seizure onset, proportion of seizures that first appeared in ipsilateral amygdala to total seizures, age, epilepsy duration, delay in the spread of ipsilateral ictal discharges from site of onset, gender, and number of electrode contacts at seizure onset (negative correlation with seizure freedom). Using these features in combination with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier compared to other commonly used classifiers resulted in very high surgical outcome prediction accuracy (95%). Conclusions Supervised machine learning using multimodal compared to unimodal data accurately predicted postsurgical outcome in patients with atypical MTLE. "}

More specifically, the model is constructed on the parameters of extreme learning machine (ELM) adaptively adjusted by the evolutionary membrane algorithm with the global optimization ability. In other words, the evolutionary membrane algorithm may find the suitable parameters of an \{ELM\} model which reduces the incidence of the overfitting of \{ELM\} affected by the noise in the actual data. Finally, the proposed model is applied to predict the endpoint parameters of molten steel in steel-making. In the simulation experiments, two test problems, including ‘SinC’ function with the Gaussian noise and the actual production data of basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steel-making, are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed model has good prediction accuracy and robustness in the data with noise. Therefore, the proposed model has good application prospects in the industrial field.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for crude oil price prediction based on a new machine learning paradigm called stream learning. The main advantage of our stream learning approach is that the prediction model can capture the changing pattern of oil prices since the model is continuously updated whenever new oil price data are available, with very small constant overhead. To evaluate the forecasting ability of our stream learning model, we compare it with three other popular oil price prediction models. The experiment results show that our stream learning model achieves the highest accuracy in terms of both mean squared prediction error and directional accuracy ratio over a variety of forecast time horizons.

Compared to the next best performing controller, energy consumption is reduced by 13% while the proportion of time spent thermally comfortable is increased by 23%. These results indicate that this is a viable approach that promises to translate into substantial comfort and energy improvements in the car. "}

Accordingly, an automatic and comprehensive feature extraction method is proposed. The proposed method accommodates real-valued scores to a probability of what percent of the given Facial Expression (FE) is present in the input image. To this end, a dual dictionary learning method is proposed to learn both regression and feature dictionaries for FER. Then, two regression classification methods are proposed using a regression model formulated based on dictionary learning and two known classification methods including Sparse Representation Classification (SRC) and Collaborative Representation Classification (CRC). Convincing results are acquired for \{FER\} on the CK+, CK, \{MMI\} and \{JAFFE\} image databases compared to several state-of-the-arts. Also, promising results are obtained from evaluating the proposed method for generalization on other databases. The proposed method not only demonstrates excellent performance by obtaining high accuracy on all four databases but also outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. "}

However, \{DP\} models are computationally intensive and might not be practical for daily decision making. Hence, the ability of applying machine learning on a prerun \{DP\} model to provide fast and accurate predictions of nonlinear and intercorrelated variables makes it an ideal methodology. Milk class (1 to 5), lactation number (1 to 9), month in milk (1 to 20), and month of pregnancy (0 to 9) were used to describe all cows in a herd in a \{DP\} model. Twenty-seven scenarios based on all combinations of 3 levels (base, 20% above, and 20% below) of milk production, milk price, and replacement cost were solved with the \{DP\} model, resulting in a data set of 122,716 records, each with a calculated retention pay-off (RPO). Then, a machine learning model tree algorithm was used to mimic the evaluated \{RPO\} with DP. The correlation coefficient factor was used to observe the concordance of \{RPO\} evaluated by \{DP\} and \{RPO\} predicted by the model tree. The obtained correlation coefficient was 0.991, with a corresponding value of 0.11 for relative absolute error. At least 100 instances were required per model constraint, resulting in 204 total equations (models). When these models were used for binary classification of positive and negative RPO, error rates were 1% false negatives and 9% false positives. Applying this trained model from simulated data for prediction of \{RPO\} for 102 actual replacement records from the University of Wisconsin-Madison dairy herd resulted in a 0.994 correlation with 0.10 relative absolute error rate. Overall results showed that model tree has a potential to be used in conjunction with \{DP\} to assist farmers in their replacement decisions. "}

Five scenarios studied in the pedestrian model literature, and with different levels of complexity, were simulated in order to analyze the robustness and the scalability of the model. Firstly, a reduced group of agents must learn by interaction with the environment in each scenario. In this phase, each agent learns its own kinematic controller, that will drive it at a simulation time. Secondly, the number of simulated agents is increased, in each scenario where agents have previously learnt, to test the appearance of emergent macroscopic behaviors without additional learning. This strategy allows us to evaluate the robustness and the consistency and quality of the learned behaviors. For this purpose several tools from pedestrian dynamics, such as fundamental diagrams and density maps, are used. The results reveal that the developed model is capable of simulating human-like micro and macro pedestrian behaviors for the simulation scenarios studied, including those where the number of pedestrians has been scaled by one order of magnitude with respect to the situation learned.

To reduce waste, today's smart buildings monitor energy usage with the aim of identifying abnormal consumption behaviour and notifying the building manager to implement appropriate energy-saving procedures. To this end, this research proposes a new pattern-based anomaly classifier, the collective contextual anomaly detection using sliding window (CCAD-SW) framework. The CCAD-SW framework identifies anomalous consumption patterns using overlapping sliding windows. To enhance the anomaly detection capacity of the CCAD-SW, this research also proposes the ensemble anomaly detection (EAD) framework. The \{EAD\} is a generic framework that combines several anomaly detection classifiers using majority voting. To ensure diversity of anomaly classifiers, the \{EAD\} is implemented by combining pattern-based (e.g., CCAD-SW) and prediction-based anomaly classifiers. The research was evaluated using real-world data provided by Powersmiths, located in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. Results show that the \{EAD\} framework improved the sensitivity of the CCAD-SW by 3.6% and reduced false alarm rate by 2.7%. "}

To improve the accuracy of EEG-based emotion classification and visualize the changes of emotional states with time, this paper systematically compares three kinds of existing \{EEG\} features for emotion classification, introduces an efficient feature smoothing method for removing the noise unrelated to emotion task, and proposes a simple approach to tracking the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold learning. To examine the effectiveness of these methods introduced in this paper, we design a movie induction experiment that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states and collect an \{EEG\} data set of six subjects. From experimental results on our \{EEG\} data set, we found that (a) power spectrum feature is superior to other two kinds of features; (b) a linear dynamic system based feature smoothing method can significantly improve emotion classification accuracy; and (c) the trajectory of emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with manifold learning.

Second, we show that state of the art recognition results can be achieved by encoding each trajectorylet using a discriminative trajectorylet detector set which is selected from a large number of candidate detectors trained through exemplar-SVMs. The action-level representation is obtained by pooling trajectorylet encodings. Evaluating on standard datasets acquired from the Kinect sensor, it is demonstrated that our method obtains superior results over existing approaches under various experimental setups. "}

At present, their specific manufacture dates and workshop localities are unknown. Relying on subjective, visual methods, scholars have grappled with their classification and regional attribution for over a century. This study combines visual approaches with machine learning techniques to offer data-driven perspectives on the classification and attribution of this Iron Age corpus. The study sample consists of 162 sculptures of female figures that have been conventionally attributed to three main regional carving traditions: “Phoenician,” “North Syrian,” and “Syrian/South Syrian”. We have developed an algorithm that clusters the ivories based on a combination of descriptive and anthropometric data. The resulting categories, which are based on purely statistical criteria, show good agreement with conventional art historical classifications, while revealing new insights, especially with regard to the “Syrian/South Syrian” tradition. Specifically, we have determined that objects of the Syrian/South Syrian tradition might be more closely related to Phoenician objects than to North Syrian objects. We also reconsider the classification of a subset of “Phoenician” objects, and we confirm Syrian/South Syrian stylistic subgroups, the geographic distribution of which might illuminate Neo-Assyrian acquisition networks. Additionally, we have identified the features in our cluster assignments that might be diagnostic of regional traditions. In short, our study both corroborates traditional visual classifications and demonstrates how machine learning techniques may be employed to retrieve complementary information not accessible through an exclusively visual analysis.

To verify the performance of our method, empirical comparisons were carried out with the canonical ELM, E-ELM, simple ensemble, EE-ELM, EN-ELM, Bagging and Adaboost to solve both regression and classification problems.

The method constructs error function and calculates the adjustment of synaptic weights as soon as the neurons emit a spike during their running process. We analyze and synthesize desired and actual output spikes to select appropriate input spikes in the calculation of weight adjustment in this paper. The experimental results show that our method obviously improves learning performance compared with the offline learning manner and has certain advantage on learning accuracy compared with other learning methods. Stronger learning ability determines that the method has large pattern storage capacity. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Visual saliency has been increasingly studied in relation to image quality assessment. Incorporating saliency potentially leads to improved ability of image quality metrics to predict perceived quality. However, challenges to optimising the combination of saliency and image quality metrics remain. Previous psychophysical studies have shown that distortion occurring in an image causes visual distractions, and alters gaze patterns relative to that of the image without distortion. From this, it can be inferred that the measurable changes of gaze patterns driven by distortion may be used as a proxy for the likely variation in perceived quality of natural images. In this paper, rather than using saliency as an add-on to image quality metrics, we investigate the plausibility of approximating picture quality based on measuring the deviation of saliency induced by distortion. First, we designed and conducted a large-scale eye-tracking experiment to clarify the knowledge on the relationship between the deviation of saliency and the variability of image quality. We then used the results to devise an algorithm which predicts perceived image quality based on visual distraction. Experimental results demonstrate this can provide good results of image quality prediction. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Real-time fault diagnostic system is very important to maintain the operation of the gas turbine generator system (GTGS) in power plants, where any abnormal situation will interrupt the electricity supply. The \{GTGS\} is complicated and has many types of component faults. To prevent from interruption of electricity supply, a reliable and quick response framework for real-time fault diagnosis of the \{GTGS\} is necessary. As the architecture and the learning algorithm of extreme learning machine (ELM) are simple and effective respectively, \{ELM\} can identify faults quickly and precisely as compared with traditional identification techniques such as support vector machines (SVM). This paper therefore proposes a new application of \{ELM\} for building a real-time fault diagnostic system in which data pre-processing techniques are integrated. In terms of data pre-processing, wavelet packet transform and time-domain statistical features are proposed for extraction of vibration signal features. Kernel principal component analysis is then applied to further reduce the redundant features in order to shorten the fault identification time and improve accuracy. To evaluate the system performance, a comparison between \{ELM\} and the prevailing \{SVM\} on the fault detection was conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed diagnostic framework can detect component faults much faster than SVM, while \{ELM\} is competitive with \{SVM\} in accuracy. This paper is also the first in the literature that explores the superiority of the fault identification time of ELM. "}

abstract = {"Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been applied as an effective therapy for treating Parkinson's disease or essential tremor. Several open-loop \{DBS\} control strategies have been developed for clinical experiments, but they are limited by short battery life and inefficient therapy. Therefore, many closed-loop \{DBS\} control systems have been designed to tackle these problems by automatically adjusting the stimulation parameters via feedback from neural signals, which has been reported to reduce the power consumption. However, when the association between the biomarkers of the model and stimulation is unclear, it is difficult to develop an optimal control scheme for other \{DBS\} applications, i.e., DBS-enhanced instrumental learning. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the effect of closed-loop \{DBS\} control for cognition function, such as instrumental skill learning, and have been implemented in simulation environments. In this paper, we proposed a proof-of-principle design for a closed-loop \{DBS\} system, cognitive-enhancing \{DBS\} (ceDBS), which enhanced skill learning based on in vivo experimental data. The ceDBS acquired local field potential (LFP) signal from the thalamic central lateral (CL) nuclei of animals through a neural signal processing system. A strong coupling of the theta oscillation (4–7 Hz) and the learning period was found in the water reward-related lever-pressing learning task. Therefore, the theta-band power ratio, which was the averaged theta band to averaged total band (1–55 Hz) power ratio, could be used as a physiological marker for enhancement of instrumental skill learning. The on-line extraction of the theta-band power ratio was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). An autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictor was designed to construct a CL-thalamic \{DBS\} model and forecast the future physiological marker according to the past physiological marker and applied DBS. The prediction could further assist the design of a closed-loop \{DBS\} controller. A \{DBS\} controller based on a fuzzy expert system was devised to automatically control \{DBS\} according to the predicted physiological marker via a set of rules. The simulated experimental results demonstrate that the ceDBS based on the closed-loop control architecture not only reduced power consumption using the predictive physiological marker, but also achieved a desired level of physiological marker through the \{DBS\} controller.

However, as a result of the limited training samples and data with complex distributions, the vast majority of these algorithms usually fail to perform well.

Most existing stepwise forward algorithms choose the regressor terms one by one, each time maximizing the model error reduction ratio. The drawback is that such procedures cannot guarantee a sparse model, especially under highly noisy learning conditions. The main objective of this paper is to improve the sparsity and generalization capability of a model for multi-output regression problems, while reducing the computational complexity. This is achieved by proposing a novel multi-output two-stage locally regularized model construction (MTLRMC) method using the extreme learning machine (ELM). In this new algorithm, the nonlinear parameters in each term, such as the width of the Gaussian function and the power of a polynomial term, are firstly determined by the ELM. An initial multi-output \{LITP\} model is then generated according to the termination criteria in the first stage. The significance of each selected regressor is checked and the insignificant ones are replaced at the second stage. The proposed method can produce an optimized compact model by using the regularized parameters. Further, to reduce the computational complexity, a proper regression context is used to allow fast implementation of the proposed method. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique. "}

Performance was assessed using a reference standard generated from 2860 \{VA\} discharge summaries containing 567,520 phrases that had been mapped to 12,056 distinct Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) concepts by the \{MCVS\} natural language processing system. It was also assessed on the manually annotated, 2010 i2b2 challenge data. Performance was established with regard to precision, recall, and F-measure for each of the concepts within the \{VA\} documents using bootstrapping. Within that corpus, concepts identified by \{MCVS\} were broadly distributed throughout \{SNOMED\} CT, and the token-order-specific language model achieved better performance based on precision, recall, and F-measure (0.95 ± 0.15, 0.96 ± 0.16, and 0.95 ± 0.16, respectively; mean ± SD) than the bag-of-words based, naïve Bayes model (0.64 ± 0.45, 0.61 ± 0.46, and 0.60 ± 0.45, respectively) that has previously been used for concept mapping. Precision, recall, and F-measure on the i2b2 test set were 92.9%, 85.9%, and 89.2% respectively, using the token-order-specific model. RapTAT required just 7.2 ms to map all phrases within a single discharge summary, and mapping rate did not decrease as the number of processed documents increased. The high performance attained by the tool in terms of both accuracy and speed was encouraging, and the mapping rate should be sufficient to support near-real-time, interactive annotation of medical narratives.

abstract = {"Abstract In this paper, a novel 1-norm extreme learning machine (ELM) for regression and multiclass classification is proposed as a linear programming problem whose solution is obtained by solving its dual exterior penalty problem as an unconstrained minimization problem using a fast Newton method. The algorithm converges from any starting point and can be easily implemented in MATLAB. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it leads to a sparse model representation meaning that many components of the optimal solution vector will become zero and therefore the decision function can be determined using much less number of hidden nodes in comparison to ELM. Numerical experiments were performed on a number of interesting real-world benchmark datasets and their results are compared with \{ELM\} using additive and radial basis function (RBF) hidden nodes, optimally pruned \{ELM\} (OP-ELM) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. Similar or better generalization performance of the proposed method on the test data over ELM, OP-ELM and \{SVM\} clearly illustrates its applicability and usefulness. "}

abstract = {"AbstractBackground Many investigations based on nonlinear methods have been carried out for the research of seizure detection. However, some of these nonlinear measures cannot achieve satisfying performance without considering the basic rhythms of epileptic EEGs. New method To overcome the defects, this paper proposed a framework on wavelet-based nonlinear features and extreme learning machine (ELM) for the seizure detection. Three nonlinear methods, i.e., approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) were computed from orignal \{EEG\} signals and corresponding wavelet decomposed sub-bands separately. The wavelet-based energy was measured as the comparative. Then the combination of sub-band features was fed to \{ELM\} and \{SVM\} classifier respectively. Results The decomposed sub-band signals show significant discrimination between interictal and ictal states and the union of sub-band features helps to achieve better detection. All the three nonlinear methods show higher sensitivity than the wavelet-based energy analysis using the proposed framework. The wavelet-based SampEn-ELM detector reaches the best performance with a sensitivity of 92.6% and a false detection rate (FDR) of 0.078. Compared with SVM, the \{ELM\} detector is better in terms of detection accuracy and learning efficiency. Comparison with existing method(s) The decomposition of original signals into sub-bands leads to better identification of seizure events compared with that of the existing nonlinear methods without considering the time–frequency decomposition. Conclusions The proposed framework achieves not only a high detection accuracy but also a very fast learning speed, which makes it feasible for the further development of the automatic seizure detection system.

Many models attempt to predict numerical levels of \{PM10\} but a simple, clearly defined classification of \{PM10\} levels is more readily comprehensible to the general public rather than a numerical value. However, the \{PM10\} prediction model often suffers from data imbalance problem in the training dataset that results in failure to forecast the minority class of severe cases. In this study, a warning system using extreme learning machine (ELM), compared with support vector machine (SVM), was constructed to forecast the class of \{PM10\} level: Good, Moderate, and Severe. An imbalance strategy called prior duplication was also applied to improve the forecast of minority class. The experimental comparisons between \{ELM\} and \{SVM\} demonstrate that \{ELM\} produces superior accuracy relative to \{SVM\} in forecasting minority class (Severe) of \{PM10\} level with or without the imbalance strategy. Furthermore, our results show that the required training time and model size in the \{ELM\} model are much shorter and smaller than those of \{SVM\} respectively, leading to a more efficient and practical implementation of prediction model for large dataset. The performance superiority of \{ELM\} is also discussed in this paper. "}

However, \{RBMs\} have not been studied to work with ensemble learning so far. In this study, we present several methods for integrating \{RBMs\} with bagging to generate diverse and accurate individual classifiers. Taking a classification tree as the base learning algorithm, a thoroughly experimental study conducted on 31 real-world data sets yields some promising conclusions. When using the features extracted by \{RBMs\} in ensemble learning, the best way is to perform model combination respectively on the original feature set and the one extracted by a single RBM. However, the prediction performance becomes worse when the features detected by a stack of 2 \{RBMs\} are also considered. As for the features detected by RBMs, good classification can be obtained only when they are used together with the original features. "}

The safety and reliability of a ship's work rely strongly on the performance of such an engine; therefore, early detection of any type of failure that affects the engine is of crucial importance. Automatic diagnostic systems are of special importance because they can operate continuously in real time, thereby providing efficient monitoring of the engine's performance. We introduce a fully automatic machine learning-based system for engine fault detection. For this purpose, we monitor various signals that are emitted by the engine, and we use them as an input for a pattern classification algorithm. This action is realized by an ensemble of Extreme Learning Machines that work in a decomposition mode. Because we address 14 different faults and a correct operation mode, we must handle a 15-class problem. We tackle this task by binarization in one-vs-one mode, where each Extreme Learning Machine is trained on a pair of classes. Next, Error-Correcting Output Codes are used to reconstruct the original multi-class task. The results from experiments that were conducted on a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach delivers superior classification accuracy and a low response time in comparison with a number of state-of-the-art methods and thus is a suitable choice for a real-life implementation on board a ship.

abstract = {"Abstract Extreme learning machines (ELM), as a learning tool, have gained popularity due to its unique characteristics and performance. However, the generalisation capability of \{ELM\} often depends on the nature of the dataset, particularly on whether uncertainty is present in the dataset or not. In order to reduce the effects of uncertainties in \{ELM\} prediction and improve its generalisation ability, this paper proposes a hybrid system through a combination of type-2 fuzzy logic systems (type-2 FLS) and ELM; thereafter the hybrid system was applied to model permeability of carbonate reservoir. Type-2 \{FLS\} has been chosen to be a precursor to \{ELM\} in order to better handle uncertainties existing in datasets beyond the capability of type-1 fuzzy logic systems. The type-2 \{FLS\} is used to first handle uncertainties in reservoir data so that its final output is then passed to the \{ELM\} for training and then final prediction is done using the unseen testing dataset. Comparative studies have been carried out to compare the performance of the proposed T2-ELM hybrid system with each of the constituent type-2 \{FLS\} and ELM, and also artificial neural network (ANN) and support Vector machines (SVM) using five different industrial reservoir data. Empirical results show that the proposed T2-ELM hybrid system outperformed each of type-2 \{FLS\} and ELM, as the two constituent models, in all cases, with the improvement made to the \{ELM\} performance far higher against that of type-2 \{FLS\} that had a closer performance to the hybrid since it is already noted for being able to model uncertainties. The proposed hybrid also outperformed \{ANN\} and \{SVM\} models considered. "}

Firstly, mixed-domain features are extracted to construct a high-dimensional feature set characterizing the properties of non-stationary vibration signals from wind turbine transmission systems. Moreover, an effective manifold learning algorithm with non-linear dimensionality reduction capability, orthogonal neighborhood preserving embedding (ONPE), is applied to compress the high-dimensional feature set into low-dimensional eigenvectors. Finally, the low-dimensional eigenvectors are inputted into a Shannon wavelet support vector machine (SWSVM) to recognize faults. The performance of the proposed method was proved by successful fault diagnosis application in a wind turbine's gearbox. The application results indicated that the proposed method improved the accuracy of fault diagnosis. "}

However, when building such systems, one has to face parsimony problem, i.e., to look for a compromise between the complexity of the learning phase and accuracy performances. Following that, the aim of this paper is to propose a new structure of connectionist network, the Summation Wavelet Extreme Learning Machine (SW-ELM) that enables good accuracy and generalization performances, while limiting the learning time and reducing the impact of a random initialization procedure. SW-ELM is based on an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm for fast batch learning, but with dual activation functions in the hidden layer nodes. This enhances dealing with non-linearity in an efficient manner. The initialization phase of wavelets (of hidden nodes) and neural network parameters (of input-hidden layer) is performed a priori, even before data are presented to the model. The whole proposition is illustrated and discussed by performing tests on three issues related to time-series application: an “input–output” approximation problem, a one-step ahead prediction problem, and a multi-steps ahead prediction problem. Performances of SW-ELM are benchmarked with ELM, Levenberg Marquardt algorithm for Single Layer Feed Forward Network (SLFN) and \{ELMAN\} network on six industrial datasets. Results show the significance of performances achieved by SW-ELM. "}

In order to comprehensively understand these pupylation-related biological processes, identification of pupylation sites in the substrate protein sequence is the first step. The traditional wet-lab experimental approaches are both laborious and time-consuming. To timely and effectively discover pupylation sites when facing with the avalanche of new protein sequences emerging during the post-genomic Era, a novel computational predictor called PupS (pupylation site predictor) is proposed. PupS is constructed on the pseudo-amino acid composition and trained with extreme learning machine. The jackknife cross-validation results on the training dataset show that the area under an \{ROC\} Curve (AUC) value is 0.6483 by PupS, and an \{AUC\} of 0.6779 is obtained on the independent set. Our results also demonstrate that \{ELM\} is complementary to other algorithms and that constructing an ensemble classifier will generate better results.

A robot with tool-use skills can be useful in human–robot symbiosis because this allows the robot to expand its task performing abilities. Past studies that included tool-body assimilation approaches were mainly focused on obtaining the functions of the tools, and demonstrated the robot starting its motions with a tool pre-attached to the robot. This implies that the robot would not be able to decide whether and where to grasp the tool. In real life environments, robots would need to consider the possibilities of tool-grasping positions, and then grasp the tool. To address these issues, the robot performs motor babbling by grasping and nongrasping the tools to learn the robot’s body model and tool functions. In addition, the robot grasps various parts of the tools to learn different tool functions from different grasping positions. The motion experiences are learned using deep learning. In model evaluation, the robot manipulates an object task without tools, and with several tools of different shapes. The robot generates motions after being shown the initial state and a target image, by deciding whether and where to grasp the tool. Therefore, the robot is capable of generating the correct motion and grasping decision when the initial state and a target image are provided to the robot. "}

abstract = {"Abstract This paper focuses on the application of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to the classification of remote sensing hyperspectral data. The specific aim of the work is to obtain accurate thematic maps of soybean crops, which have proven to be difficult to identify by automated procedures. The classification process carried out is as follows: First, spectral data is transformed into a hyper-spherical representation. Second, a robust image gradient is computed over the hyper-spherical representation allowing an image segmentation that identifies major crop plots. Third, feature selection is achieved by a greedy wrapper approach. Finally, a classifier is trained and tested on the selected image pixel features. The classifiers used for feature selection and final classification are Single Layer Feedforward Networks (SLFN) trained with either the \{ELM\} or the incremental OP-ELM. Original image pixel features are computed following a Functional Data Analysis (FDA) characterization of the spectral data. Conventional \{ELM\} training of the \{SLFN\} improves over the classification performance of state of the art algorithms reported in the literature dealing with the data treated in this paper. Moreover, SLFN-ELM uses less features than the referred algorithms. OP-ELM is able to find competitive results using the \{FDA\} features from a single spectral band. "}

Though there exist a lot of approaches for classification, few of them address the problem of classification over uncertain data in database. Therefore, in this paper, we propose classification algorithms based on conventional and optimized \{ELM\} to conduct classification over uncertain data. Firstly we view the instances of each uncertain data as the training data for learning. Then, the probabilities of uncertain data in any class are computed according to learning results of each instance. Finally, using a bound-based approach, we implement the final classification. We also extend the proposed algorithms to classification over uncertain data in a distributed environment based on OS-ELM and Monte Carlo theory. The experiments verify the performance of our proposed algorithms. "}

The Shannon Entropy approach was utilized for choosing among training data during active learning process and it was compared with maximum disagreement method and random selection of instances.

Certain imaging features based upon early computerized tomography (CT), in combination with clinical variables, have been found to predict SICH, albeit with modest accuracy. In this proof-of-concept study, we determine whether machine learning of \{CT\} images can predict which patients receiving tPA will develop \{SICH\} as opposed to showing clinical improvement with no haemorrhage. Clinical records and \{CT\} brains of 116 acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis were collected retrospectively (including 16 who developed SICH). The sample was split into training (n = 106) and test sets (n = 10), repeatedly for 1760 different combinations. \{CT\} brain images acted as inputs into a support vector machine (SVM), along with clinical severity. Performance of the \{SVM\} was compared with established prognostication tools (SEDAN and \{HAT\} scores; original, or after adaptation to our cohort). Predictive performance, assessed as area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), of the \{SVM\} (0.744) compared favourably with that of prognostic scores (original and adapted versions: 0.626–0.720; p &lt; 0.01). The \{SVM\} also identified 9 out of 16 SICHs, as opposed to 1–5 using prognostic scores, assuming a 10% \{SICH\} frequency (p &lt; 0.001). In summary, machine learning methods applied to acute stroke \{CT\} images offer automation, and potentially improved performance, for prediction of \{SICH\} following thrombolysis. Larger-scale cohorts, and incorporation of advanced imaging, should be tested with such methods. "}

The application of machine learning is a promising alternative to manual analysis of such data. However, the complex structure of the data, which includes clinical events that are unevenly distributed over time, poses a challenge for standard learning algorithms. Some approaches to modeling temporal data rely on extracting single values from time series; however, this leads to the loss of potentially valuable sequential information. How to better account for the temporality of clinical data, hence, remains an important research question. In this study, novel representations of temporal data in electronic health records are explored. These representations retain the sequential information, and are directly compatible with standard machine learning algorithms. The explored methods are based on symbolic sequence representations of time series data, which are utilized in a number of different ways. An empirical investigation, using 19 datasets comprising clinical measurements observed over time from a real database of electronic health records, shows that using a distance measure to random subsequences leads to substantial improvements in predictive performance compared to using the original sequences or clustering the sequences. Evidence is moreover provided on the quality of the symbolic sequence representation by comparing it to sequences that are generated using domain knowledge by clinical experts. The proposed method creates representations that better account for the temporality of clinical events, which is often key to prediction tasks in the biomedical domain. "}

Identifiability defines a uniqueness property to the model parameters. This property is particularly important for those physically interpretable parameters in \{GC\} models. We derive identifiability criteria according to the types of models. First, by taking the models as a family of deterministic nonlinear transformations from input space to output space, we provide a criterion for examining identifiability of the Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) models. This result therefore generalizes the previous one for Single-input Single-output (SISO) and Multiple-input Single-output (MISO) models. Second, if considering the models as the mean functions of input-dependent conditional distributions within stochastic framework, we derive an identifiability criterion by means of the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) and regular summary. Third, time-variant models are studied based on the exhaustive summary method. The new identifiability criterion is valid for a range of differential/difference equation models whenever their exhaustive summaries can be obtained. Several model examples from the literature are presented to examine their identifiability property. "}

The performance of the proposed algorithm has been experimentally verified using \{GPS\} and \{SINS\} data of different trajectories collected in some land vehicle navigation tests.

Many factors are involved in the disappearance of species, including stochastic population fluctuations, habitat change, resource depletion, and inbreeding. Due to the complexity of the interactions between these various factors and the lengthy time period required to make empirical observations, studying the phenomenon of species extinction can prove to be very difficult in nature. On the other hand, an investigation of the various features involved in species extinction using individual-based simulation modeling and machine learning techniques can be accomplished in a reasonably short period of time. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate multiple factors involved in species extinction using computer simulation modeling. We apply several machine learning techniques to the data generated by EcoSim, a predator–prey ecosystem simulation, in order to select the most prominent features involved in species extinction, along with extracting rules that outline conditions that have the potential to be used for predicting extinction. In particular, we used five feature selection methods resulting in the selection of 25 features followed by a reduction of these to 14 features using correlation analysis. Each of the remaining features was placed in one of three broad categories, viz., genetic, environmental, or demographic. The experimental results suggest that factors such as population fluctuation, reproductive age, and genetic distance are important in the occurrence of species extinction in EcoSim, similar to what is observed in nature. We argue that the study of the behavior of species through Individual-Based Modeling has the potential to give rise to new insights into the central factors involved in extinction for real ecosystems. This approach has the potential to help with the detection of early signals of species extinction that could in turn lead to conservation policies to help prevent extinction. "}

Features are computed for each point in each window based on curvature and other geometric properties.

These features are used to train a statistical classifier to identify which candidate windows contain true segment points. ClassySeg is more accurate than previous techniques for both user-independent and user-optimized training conditions.

We carry out a rigorous comparison of five MLAs: Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks, in the context of a supervised lithology classification task using widely available and spatially constrained remotely sensed geophysical data. We make a further comparison of \{MLAs\} based on their sensitivity to variations in the degree of spatial clustering of training data, and their response to the inclusion of explicit spatial information (spatial coordinates). Our work identifies Random Forests as a good first choice algorithm for the supervised classification of lithology using remotely sensed geophysical data. Random Forests is straightforward to train, computationally efficient, highly stable with respect to variations in classification model parameter values, and as accurate as, or substantially more accurate than the other \{MLAs\} trialed. The results of our study indicate that as training data becomes increasingly dispersed across the region under investigation, \{MLA\} predictive accuracy improves dramatically. The use of explicit spatial information generates accurate lithology predictions but should be used in conjunction with geophysical data in order to generate geologically plausible predictions.

The outcome of each breeding can be affected by many management and physiological features that vary between farms and interact with each other. Hence, the ability of machine learning algorithms to accommodate complex relationships in the data and missing values for explanatory variables makes these algorithms well suited for investigation of reproduction performance in dairy cattle. The objective of this study was to develop a user-friendly and intuitive on-farm tool to help farmers make reproduction management decisions. Several different machine learning algorithms were applied to predict the insemination outcomes of individual cows based on phenotypic and genotypic data. Data from 26 dairy farms in the Alta Genetics (Watertown, WI) Advantage Progeny Testing Program were used, representing a 10-yr period from 2000 to 2010. Health, reproduction, and production data were extracted from on-farm dairy management software, and estimated breeding values were downloaded from the \{US\} Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Animal Improvement Programs Laboratory (Beltsville, MD) database. The edited data set consisted of 129,245 breeding records from primiparous Holstein cows and 195,128 breeding records from multiparous Holstein cows. Each data point in the final data set included 23 and 25 explanatory variables and 1 binary outcome for of 0.756 ± 0.005 and 0.736 ± 0.005 for primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. The naïve Bayes algorithm, Bayesian network, and decision tree algorithms showed somewhat poorer classification performance. An information-based variable selection procedure identified herd average conception rate, incidence of ketosis, number of previous (failed) inseminations, days in milk at breeding, and mastitis as the most effective explanatory variables in predicting pregnancy outcome.

But only a few studies have explored the possibility of \{AD\} detection from non-image data. These studies have applied traditional data visualization and classification algorithms. There is a need for new sophisticated learning algorithms, for detecting and quantifying the severity of \{AD\} by exploring the complex interactions between the features in \{AD\} subjects. Method: In this work, a supervised learning model to effectively capture the complex feature interactions, in the sample space of \{AD\} data, is presented for knowledge discovery. The discovered knowledge is further used to quantify the similarity of a test subject to the demented class. Results: Evaluation of the proposed model, on \{OASIS\} database of Alzheimer's subjects, validates the well established risk factors and identifiers for AD: Age, Socio-Economic Status, \{MMSE\} Score and Whole Brain Volume. The Test subjects are affiliated to either non-demented (ND) or \{AD\} class, with non-overlapping and measurable similarity indices: Female \{ND\} (CDR=0) [0.48–2.90], Female \{AD\} (CDR=0.5) [90.16–774.51], Female \{AD\} (CDR=1) [1633.90–7182.23], Female \{AD\} (CDR=2) [55258.51–66382.44], Male \{ND\} (CDR=0)[0.69–3.66], Male \{AD\} (CDR=0.5) [99.18–647.51] and Male \{AD\} (CDR=1) [3880.16–6519.40]. Conclusion: The outcome of the work clearly demonstrates that, supervised learning model can be used effectively to quantify the severity of \{AD\} on a standard measurable scale.

The new company intends to locate p hubs and assign the center nodes to the located hubs in order to form origin–destination pairs. It desires not only to maximize the total captured flow in the market but also aims to minimize the total transportation cost. Three competition rules are established between the companies which must be abided. According to the competition rules, the new company can capture the full percentage of the traffic in each origin-destination pair if its transportation cost for each route is significantly less than of the competitor. If its transportation cost for each route is not significantly less than one of the competitors, only a certain percentage of the traffic can be captured. A bi-objective optimization model is proposed for the hub location problem on hand under a competitive environment. As the problem is shown to be NP-hard, a novel meta-heuristic algorithm called multi-objective biogeography-based optimization is developed. As there is no benchmark in the literature, a popular non-dominated sorting algorithm is utilized to validate the results obtained. Moreover, to enhance the performance of the proposed Pareto-based algorithms, this paper intends to develop a binary opposition-based learning as a diversity mechanism for both algorithms. The algorithms are tuned to solve the problem, based on which their performances are compared, ranked, and analyzed statistically. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach and the solution methodologies are demonstrated in three steps. "}

More specifically, this paper reports on three of the most effective machine learning techniques for text classification: k-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine using term frequency as a term selection approach. In doing so, a dataset of questions has been collected and classified manually into Bloom's cognitive levels. Preprocessing steps have been applied to convert questions into a representation suitable for machine learning techniques. Using this dataset, the performance of the three machine learning techniques has been evaluated. The results show a comparable performance of k-Nearest Neighbor and Naïve Bayes and a superior performance of Support Vector Machine in term of \{F1\} and accuracy. Moreover the results also indicate that machine learning techniques show different levels of sensitivity to the number of terms used for question representation. "}

Many of these models are applied to discriminating clinical groups such as schizophrenic patients from healthy controls or from patients with bipolar disorder. A more nuanced model might be to discriminate between levels of personality traits. Here, as a proof of concept, we take an initial step toward developing prediction models to differentiate individuals based on a personality disorder: psychopathy. We included three groups of adolescent participants: incarcerated youth with elevated psychopathic traits (i.e., callous and unemotional traits and conduct disordered traits; n = 71), incarcerated youth with low psychopathic traits (n = 72), and non-incarcerated youth as healthy controls (n = 21). Support vector machine (SVM) learning models were developed to separate these groups using an out-of-sample cross-validation method on voxel-based morphometry (VBM) data. Regions of interest from the paralimbic system, identified in an independent forensic sample, were successful in differentiating youth groups. Models seeking to classify incarcerated individuals to have high or low psychopathic traits achieved 69.23% overall accuracy. As expected, accuracy increased in models differentiating healthy controls from individuals with high psychopathic traits (82.61%) and low psychopathic traits (80.65%). Here we have laid the foundation for using neural correlates of personality traits to identify group membership within and beyond psychopathy. This is only the first step, of many, toward prediction models using neural measures as a proxy for personality traits. As these methods are improved, prediction models with neural measures of personality traits could have far-reaching impact on diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of future behavior. "}

About 3–5% of hospital admissions are linked with heart failure incidents. Heart failure is the first cause of admission by healthcare professionals in their clinical practice. The costs are very high, reaching up to 2% of the total health costs in the developed countries. Building an effective disease management strategy requires analysis of large amount of data, early detection of the disease, assessment of the severity and early prediction of adverse events. This will inhibit the progression of the disease, will improve the quality of life of the patients and will reduce the associated medical costs. Toward this direction machine learning techniques have been employed. The aim of this paper is to present the state-of-the-art of the machine learning methodologies applied for the assessment of heart failure. More specifically, models predicting the presence, estimating the subtype, assessing the severity of heart failure and predicting the presence of adverse events, such as destabilizations, re-hospitalizations, and mortality are presented. According to the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that such a comprehensive review, focusing on all aspects of the management of heart failure, is presented. "}

In this work, a methodology to predict the breaking force and disintegration time of tablet formulations using nondestructive ultrasonics and machine learning tools was developed. The input variables to the model include intrinsic properties of formulation and extrinsic process variables influencing the tablet during manufacturing. The model has been applied to predict breaking force and disintegration time using small quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient and prototype formulation designs.

Methods Expert-annotated speckle-tracking echocardiographic datasets obtained from 77 \{ATH\} and 62 \{HCM\} patients were used for developing an automated system. An ensemble machine-learning model with 3 different machine-learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks) was developed and a majority voting method was used for conclusive predictions with further K-fold cross-validation. Results Feature selection using an information gain (IG) algorithm revealed that volume was the best predictor for differentiating between \{HCM\} ands. \{ATH\} (IG = 0.24) followed by mid-left ventricular segmental (IG = 0.134) and average longitudinal strain (IG = 0.131). The ensemble machine-learning model showed increased sensitivity and specificity compared with early-to-late diastolic transmitral velocity ratio (p &lt; 0.01), average early diastolic tissue velocity (e′) (p &lt; 0.01), and strain (p = 0.04). Because \{ATH\} were younger, adjusted analysis was undertaken in younger \{HCM\} patients and compared with \{ATH\} with left ventricular wall thickness &gt;13 mm. In this subgroup analysis, the automated model continued to show equal sensitivity, but increased specificity relative to early-to-late diastolic transmitral velocity ratio, e′, and strain. Conclusions Our results suggested that machine-learning algorithms can assist in the discrimination of physiological versus pathological patterns of hypertrophic remodeling.

In electronic manufacturing industry, an electronic component may be exposed to certain electromagnetic field and requires an extra time for eliminating adverse effect after the main processing. The extra time is modeled as past-sequence-dependent delivery time in the literature, which is proportional to the waiting time in the system. It is also observed that the learning process reflects a decrease in the processing time as a function of the number of repetitions, i.e., as a function of the job position in the sequence. In practice, one often has to deal with the scheduling problems with psd delivery times and learning effect. Identical parallel-machine setting is considered because the occurrence of resources in parallel is common in the real world. In this paper, three objectives are the minimization of the total absolute deviation of job completion times, the total load on all machines and the total completion time. We develop polynomial algorithms to optimally solve these problems. "}

abstract = {"Abstract First episode psychosis (FEP) patients are of particular interest for neuroimaging investigations because of the absence of confounding effects due to medications and chronicity. Nonetheless, imaging data are prone to heterogeneity because for example of age, gender or parameter setting differences. With this work, we wanted to take into account possible nuisance effects of age and gender differences across dataset, not correcting the data as a pre-processing step, but including the effect of nuisance covariates in the classification phase. To this aim, we developed a method which, based on multiple kernel learning (MKL), exploits the effect of these confounding variables with a subject-depending kernel weighting procedure. We applied this method to a dataset of cortical thickness obtained from structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 127 \{FEP\} patients and 127 healthy controls, who underwent either a 3 Tesla (T) or a 1.5 T \{MRI\} acquisition. We obtained good accuracies, notably better than those obtained with standard \{SVM\} or \{MKL\} methods, up to more than 80% for frontal and temporal areas. To our best knowledge, this is the largest classification study in \{FEP\} population, showing that fronto-temporal cortical thickness can be used as a potential marker to classify patients with psychosis.

In this paper regularized pairwise learning (RPL) methods based on kernels will be investigated. One example is regularized minimization of the error entropy loss which has recently attracted quite some interest from the viewpoint of consistency and learning rates. This paper shows that such \{RPL\} methods and also their empirical bootstrap have additionally good statistical robustness properties, if the loss function and the kernel are chosen appropriately. We treat two cases of particular interest: (i) a bounded and non-convex loss function and (ii) an unbounded convex loss function satisfying a certain Lipschitz type condition. "}

A mixed-integer programming (MIP ) model is first formulated to find the optimal solution for small-size problem instances. Some new dominance rules are then presented which provide a sufficient condition for finding local optimality. The branch-and-bound (B&amp; B) strategy incorporating with several dominance properties and a lower bound is proposed to derive the optimal solution for medium- to-large-size problem instances, and four marriage-in-honey-bees optimization algorithms (MBO) are developed to derive near-optimal solutions for the problem. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, 3600 situations with 20 and 25 jobs, are randomly generated for experiments. "}

abstract = {"Abstract The research presented in this paper proposes a new machine learning-based evaluation method for assessing the usability of eLearning systems. Three machine learning methods (support vector machines, neural networks and decision trees) along with multiple linear regression are used to develop prediction models in order to discover the underlying relationship between the overall eLearning system usability and its predictor factors. A subsequent sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the rank-order importance of the predictors. Using both sensitivity values along with the usability scores, a metric (called severity index) is devised. By applying a Pareto-like analysis, the severity index values are ranked and the most important usability characteristics are identified. The case study results show that the proposed methodology enhances the determination of eLearning system problems by identifying the most pertinent usability factors. The proposed method could provide an invaluable guidance to the usability experts as to what measures should be improved in order to maximize the system usability for a targeted group of end-users of an eLearning system.

Traditional Pulse-height Analysis (PHA) for Neutron-Gamma Discrimination (NGD) resulted in the neutron-gamma efficiency ratio (NGD ratio) on the order of 105–106. The \{NGD\} ratios of 3He detectors need to be improved for even better scientific results from neutron scattering. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) analyses of waveforms were proposed for obtaining better \{NGD\} ratios, based on features extracted from rise-time, pulse amplitude, charge integration, a simplified Wiener filter, and the cross-correlation between individual and template waveforms of neutron and gamma events. Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and three Multivariate Analyses (MVAs) of the features were performed. The \{NGD\} ratios are improved by about 102–103 times compared with the traditional \{PHA\} method. Our results indicate the \{NGD\} capabilities of 3He tube detectors can be significantly improved with subspace-learning based methods, which may result in a reduced data-collection time and better data quality for further data reduction.

In this paper, we adopt a deep learning framework for the illumination estimation problem. The proposed method works under the assumption of uniform illumination over the scene and aims for the accurate illuminant color computation. Specifically, we trained the convolutional neural network to solve the problem by casting the color constancy problem as an illumination classification problem. We designed the deep learning architecture so that the output of the network can be directly used for computing the color of the illumination. Experimental results show that our deep network is able to extract useful features for the illumination estimation and our method outperforms all previous color constancy methods on multiple test datasets.

abstract = {"Abstract Sentiment analysis is the natural language processing task dealing with sentiment detection and classification from texts. In recent years, due to the growth in the quantity and fast spreading of user-generated contents online and the impact such information has on events, people and companies worldwide, this task has been approached in an important body of research in the field. Despite different methods having been proposed for distinct types of text, the research community has concentrated less on developing methods for languages other than English. In the above-mentioned context, the present work studies the possibility to employ machine translation systems and supervised methods to build models able to detect and classify sentiment in languages for which less/no resources are available for this task when compared to English, stressing upon the impact of translation quality on the sentiment classification performance. Our extensive evaluation scenarios show that machine translation systems are approaching a good level of maturity and that they can, in combination to appropriate machine learning algorithms and carefully chosen features, be used to build sentiment analysis systems that can obtain comparable performances to the one obtained for English.
