"Extensible Architecture for Multimodal Information Retrieval in Medical Imaging Archives","E. Pinho; C. Costa","","2016 12th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems (SITIS)","20170424","2016","","","316","322","The challenge of medical information retrieval has attracted significant attention since the introduction of digital imaging in hospitals and other health facilities. Given the huge growth of medical imaging data produced in the past few years, studying new ways to index, process and retrieve medical images becomes an important subject to be addressed by the wider community of radiologists, scientists and engineers. At the moment, content-based image retrieval in medical imaging archives, although known to be beneficial to practitioners and researchers, is still rarely integrated into these archives. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of multimodal information retrieval for medical imaging studies, as well as the architecture of a solution for automatic medical image classification and retrieval using combinations of text and image queries. The complete solution was designed and implemented over an extensible open-source medical imaging archive software.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5698-9; POD:978-1-5090-5699-6","10.1109/SITIS.2016.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7907485","content-based image retrieval;distributed systems;medical imaging;multimodal information retrieval","DICOM;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Medical diagnostic imaging;Picture archiving and communication systems;Visualization","","","","","","","","","Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data plays an important role in Information retrieval. In today's global environment, databases should support multilingual text data efficiently and effectively. All the government records or portals today are required in regional language. The retrieval depends on the type of query passed and how the optimizer behaves with the amount and type of data to be retrieved. Hence it is imperative that the information systems support the storage and management of multi-lingual data effectively. The primary requirement to achieve this goal is that the principal data repositories should support storage and retrieval of Multi-lingual data. Our initial experiments indicated considerable performance degradation when comparisons where made between English and Gujarati language. This paper explores the work carried out by various researchers in Multilingual environment and our preliminary analysis for the same for Indian languages with emphasize on Gujarati language.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5515-9; POD:978-1-5090-5516-6","10.1109/ICTBIG.2016.7892650","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7892650","E-Governance;Multi-lingual;Query Optimization","Data engineering;Information retrieval;Query processing;Standards;Structured Query Language","database management systems;government data processing;natural language processing;query processing;text analysis","Gujarati language;data repository;database;e-governance resource;government record;information retrieval;information system;multilingual data management;multilingual data storage;multilingual environment;multilingual text data;query optimization","","","","","","","18-19 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Semantically Enhanced Medical Information Retrieval System: A Tensor Factorization Based Approach","H. Wang; Q. Zhang; J. Yuan","","IEEE Access","","2017","PP","99","1","1","Medical information retrieval plays an increasingly important role to help physicians and domain experts to better access medical related knowledge and information, and support decision making. Integrating the medical knowledge bases has the potential to improve the information retrieval performance through incorporating medical domain knowledge for relevance assessment. However, this is not a trivial task because of the challenges to effectively utilize the domain knowledge in the medical knowledge bases. In this paper, we proposed a novel medical information retrieval system with a two-stage query expansion strategy, which is able to effectively model and incorporate the latent semantic associations to improve the performance. This system consists of two parts. First, we applied a heuristic approach to enhance the widely used pseudo relevance feedback method for more effective query expansion, through iteratively expanding the queries to boost the similarity score between queries and documents. Second, to improve the retrieval performance with structured knowledge bases, we presented a latent semantic relevance model based on tensor factorization to identify semantic association patterns under sparse settings. These identified patterns are then used as inference paths to trigger knowledge-based query expansion in medical information retrieval. Experiments with the TREC CDS 2014 dataset (a) showed that the performance of the proposed system is significantly better than the baseline system and the systems reported in TREC CDS 2014 conference, and is comparable with state-of-the-art systems; (b) demonstrated the capability of tensor-based semantic enrichment methods for medical information retrieval tasks.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2698142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7912400","Information retrieval;knowledge based systems;tensor factorization","Data mining;Information retrieval;Knowledge based systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Semantics;Tensile stress;Unified modeling language","","","","","","","","20170426","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This is often the case in bug and feature location, community question answering, or more generally the communication between technical personnel and non-technical stake holders in a software project. In this paper, we propose bridging the lexical gap by projecting natural language statements and code snippets as meaning vectors in a shared representation space. In the proposed architecture, word embeddings are rst trained on API documents, tutorials, and reference documents, and then aggregated in order to estimate semantic similarities between documents. Empirical evaluations show that the learned vector space embeddings lead to improvements in a previously explored bug localization task and a newly de ned task of linking API documents to computer programming questions.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3900-1; POD:978-1-5090-2071-3","10.1145/2884781.2884862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886921","API documents;bug localization;bug reports;skip-gram model;word embeddings","Computer bugs;Context;Mathematical model;Natural languages;Semantics;Software;Vocabulary","application program interfaces;document handling;information retrieval;natural language processing;software engineering;system documentation","API documents;bug localization task;code snippets;document similarities;information retrieval techniques;natural language statements;reference documents;software engineering;tutorials;vector space embeddings;word embeddings","","","","","","","14-22 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"STRICT: Information retrieval based search term identification for concept location","M. M. Rahman; C. K.

Such natural language texts illustrate the change requirement involving various domain related concepts. Software developers need to find appropriate search terms from those concepts so that they could locate the possible locations in the source code using a search technique. Once such locations are identified, they can implement the requested changes there. Studies suggest that developers often perform poorly in coming up with good search terms for a change task. In this paper, we propose a novel technique-STRICT-that automatically identifies suitable search terms for a software change task by analyzing its task description using two information retrieval (IR) techniques-TextRank and POSRank. These IR techniques determine a term's importance based on not only its co-occurrences with other important terms but also its syntactic relationships with them. Experiments using 1,939 change requests from eight subject systems report that STRICT can identify better quality search terms than baseline terms from 52%-62% of the requests with 30%-57% Top-10 retrieval accuracy which are promising. Comparison with two state-of-the-art techniques not only validates our empirical findings and but also demonstrates the superiority of our technique.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5501-2; POD:978-1-5090-5502-9","10.1109/SANER.2017.7884611","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7884611","Concept location;POSRank;TextRank;information retrieval;search term identification","Information retrieval;Java;Maintenance engineering;Natural languages;Position measurement;Software;Syntactics","graph theory;information retrieval;natural language processing;software maintenance;text analysis","IR;POSRank;STRICT;TextRank;concept location;graph based term-weighting;information retrieval;natural language text;search term identification;software change task;software developer;software maintenance;task description analysis","","","","","","","20-24 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes the task of navigating through this enormous amount of data quite difficult for the user. As users struggle to navigate through this wealth of information, the need for the development of an automated system that can extract the required information becomes urgent. This paper presents a Question Answering system to ease the process of information retrieval. Question Answering systems have been around for quite some time and are a sub-field of information retrieval and natural language processing. The task of any Question Answering system is to seek an answer to a free form factual question. The difficulty of pinpointing and verifying the precise answer makes question answering more challenging than simple information retrieval done by search engines. The research objective of this paper is to develop a novel approach to Question Answering based on a composition of conventional approaches of Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language processing (NLP). The focus is also on exploring the use of a structured and annotated knowledge base as opposed to an unstructured knowledge base. The knowledge base used here is DBpedia and the final system is evaluated on the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 2004 questions dataset.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4284-5; POD:978-1-5090-4285-2","10.1109/ICSC.2017.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889571","Information Retrieval;Natural Language Processing;Question Answering System;Structured Semantic Data","Databases;Information retrieval;Internet;Knowledge discovery;Natural language processing;Semantics","Internet;Web sites;knowledge based systems;natural language processing;question answering (information retrieval)","DBpedia;IR;NLP;World Wide Web;annotated knowledge base;information extraction;information retrieval;natural language processing;question answering system;structured knowledge base","","","","","","","Jan. 30 2017-Feb. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
